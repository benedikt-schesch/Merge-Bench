Okay, I will analyze the intent of both sides and provide a resolution.

*   **HEAD:** This side introduces the import `org.spout.api.protocol.CommonHandler;`. The intent here is likely that changes made in this branch require the `CommonHandler` class, presumably for new or modified functionality related to network protocols.
*   **67bcb76a96f358fc131320b0611ffaa3bf3678c2:** This side does not have this import. This could mean either the `CommonHandler` was never used, or its usage (and thus the import) was removed in this branch, perhaps due to a refactoring or deletion of features that used it.

**Resolution Reasoning:**

Merge conflicts in import statements often arise when one branch adds a dependency for new code, while the other doesn't have that code or has refactored away from that dependency.

Without seeing the rest of the code, it's impossible to be 100% certain. However, a common scenario is that `HEAD` is introducing functionality that relies on `CommonHandler`. The other `org.spout.api.protocol.*` imports suggest that `CommonHandler` is a semantically related class.

Generally, when merging, if one branch introduces a new class dependency for its features, and those features are intended to be part of the merged result, the import should be kept. If the import were truly unnecessary after merging all code changes, an IDE or linter would typically flag it as an unused import, which could then be cleaned up. Removing it now risks breaking the functionality introduced by `HEAD`.

Assuming the changes from `HEAD` that require `CommonHandler` are desired in the merge, the most sensible resolution is to include the import.

```java
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Point;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Transform;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector2;
import org.spout.api.protocol.CommonHandler;
import org.spout.api.protocol.CommonPipelineFactory;
import org.spout.api.protocol.PortBinding;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Protocol;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Session;
import org.spout.api.render.RenderMode;
