The merge conflict occurs on a line that is visually empty but contains whitespace characters. Both sides of the merge are attempting to add a blank line for readability between variable declarations and their initialization.

- **HEAD** introduces an empty line with two tabs followed by seven spaces: `\t\t       `
- **Branch `02da86c...`** introduces an empty line with two tabs followed by eight spaces: `\t\t        `

The semantic intent of both changes is identical: to create vertical spacing in the code. The difference of one space character on an otherwise empty line has no effect on the program's execution or logic.

Given that the intent is clear and the difference is purely stylistic and non-semantic, a valid resolution is to pick one of the two versions. We will choose the version from `HEAD`.

```java
public class ReliefFilter {
	// 浮雕效果函数
	public static Bitmap changeToRelief(Bitmap mBitmap) {        
		 int mBitmapWidth = 0;
		 int mBitmapHeight = 0;
		       
		 mBitmapWidth = mBitmap.getWidth();
		 mBitmapHeight = mBitmap.getHeight();
		 
		 Bitmap bmpReturn = Bitmap.createBitmap(mBitmapWidth, mBitmapHeight, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888); 
```
