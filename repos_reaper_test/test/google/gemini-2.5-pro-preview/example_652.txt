Okay, I will analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict to propose a resolution.

**Understanding the Conflict:**

*   **HEAD:** This side introduces a new boolean field `canComment` along with `@Getter` and `@Setter` annotations. It also includes a blank line after the field declaration.
*   **a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe:** This side contributes an empty block, meaning it does not want the `canComment` field (or, more likely, this branch does not have this field, and the common ancestor also didn't).

**Semantic Intent:**

*   **HEAD's Intent:** To add a new property `canComment` to the class, presumably to control or represent whether commenting is allowed for the object this class represents. The presence of `@Getter` and `@Setter` indicates it's a standard mutable Java bean property.
*   **a17acec... 's Intent:** To not have this specific `canComment` field. This could be because the field was never added on this branch, or it was intentionally removed. However, an empty conflict block often signifies that the other branch simply *lacks* the addition made in HEAD.

**Contextual Clues:**

Below the conflicted block, there are fields:
```java
  @Facebook("comment_order")
  private String openGraphCommentOrder;

  @Facebook("can_comment")
  private Boolean openGraphCanComment;
```
The field `openGraphCanComment` is particularly relevant. It's a `Boolean` field annotated with `@Facebook("can_comment")`. This suggests that the concept of "can comment" is already present in the context of Facebook integration.

**Resolution Rationale:**

1.  **Additive Change:** HEAD is making an additive change (introducing a new field). The other branch doesn't introduce a conflicting field at the same location but rather reflects the absence of this new field. In such cases, the additive change is often the desired outcome, representing new functionality.
2.  **Distinct Purpose:** The new `canComment` field is a general-purpose field. The existing `openGraphCanComment` is specifically for Facebook integration, as indicated by the `@Facebook` annotation. It's common to have a general application-level property and a more specific one for external integrations. These two fields can coexist and may even be related (e.g., `openGraphCanComment` could be derived from `canComment` or vice-versa, or they could be independently managed).
3.  **No Clear Redundancy:** Without more information, it's not definitively clear that `canComment` is redundant due to `openGraphCanComment`. They might serve different purposes or be part of a larger data model where both are necessary.

Given these points, the most semantically sound resolution is to incorporate the addition from HEAD. This means the `canComment` field, along with its annotations and the trailing blank line that was part of HEAD's change, will be included.

```java
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  private String order;

  @Getter
  @Setter
  private Boolean canComment;

  @Facebook("comment_order")
  private String openGraphCommentOrder;

  @Facebook("can_comment")
  private Boolean openGraphCanComment;

```
