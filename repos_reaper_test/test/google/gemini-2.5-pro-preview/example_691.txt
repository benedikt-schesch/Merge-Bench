Okay, I will analyze the merge conflict and resolve it based on the semantic intent of the changes.

**Analysis of the Conflict:**

The snippet contains two conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`).

**First Conflict:**
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
	public static final Property<Integer> successNotificationsDelayProperty  = new IntProperty("successNotificationsDelay").hint("Delay before hiding success notifications").defaultValue(5000).partOfBuiltInSchema();
=======
>>>>>>> d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5
```
-   **HEAD branch's intent:** To add a new property `successNotificationsDelayProperty`. This property is an `IntProperty` for configuring a delay (defaulting to 5000ms) for success notifications. This is an additive change, introducing new functionality consistent with the surrounding notification properties.
-   **d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5 branch's intent:** This branch has no corresponding line for `successNotificationsDelayProperty`. This means either this branch does not include this feature, or it predates its introduction.

**Resolution for the First Conflict:**
The addition of `successNotificationsDelayProperty` by HEAD is a clear enhancement and fits semantically with the other `successNotifications` properties. There is no conflicting change from the other branch. Therefore, the resolution is to include the line from HEAD.

**Second Conflict:**
The snippet ends with:
```java
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsEventProperty   = new StringProperty("failureNotificationsEvent").hint("Event to raise for failure notifications").partOfBuiltInSchema();
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
-   **HEAD branch's content:** This shows the beginning of a conflict marker (`<<<<<<< HEAD`) followed by a newline. This indicates that HEAD's version of this section of the code includes a newline character after the `failureNotificationsEventProperty` line.
-   **d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5 branch's content:** The `=======` and `>>>>>>> d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5` parts of this conflict are not provided in the snippet. Without seeing what the other branch (`d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5`) contributes or lacks in this conflicting section, it's impossible to determine the combined semantic intent. For example, the other branch might have deleted content here, or it might have different content that starts after the `failureNotificationsEventProperty` line without an intervening blank line.

**Resolution for the Second Conflict:**
Due to the missing information for the `d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5` side of this conflict, the intent is ambiguous. As per the instructions, if the intent is ambiguous or I am not sure how to resolve it, I should return the snippet with the conflict markers for that section.

**Final Resolved Snippet:**
I will resolve the first conflict and leave the second conflict markers as they are because the provided snippet is incomplete for that part.

```java
	public static final Property<String> dialogTextProperty  = new StringProperty("dialogText").hint("Dialog Text").partOfBuiltInSchema();

	public static final Property<String> successNotificationsProperty        = new StringProperty("successNotifications").hint("Notifications after successful execution of action").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successNotificationsPartialProperty = new StringProperty("successNotificationsPartial").hint("CSS selector for partial to display as success notification").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successNotificationsEventProperty   = new StringProperty("successNotificationsEvent").hint("Event to raise for success notifications").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<Integer> successNotificationsDelayProperty  = new IntProperty("successNotificationsDelay").hint("Delay before hiding success notifications").defaultValue(5000).partOfBuiltInSchema();

	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsProperty        = new StringProperty("failureNotifications").hint("Notifications after failed execution of action").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsPartialProperty = new StringProperty("failureNotificationsPartial").hint("CSS selector for partial to display as failure notification").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsEventProperty   = new StringProperty("failureNotificationsEvent").hint("Event to raise for failure notifications").partOfBuiltInSchema();
<<<<<<< HEAD
