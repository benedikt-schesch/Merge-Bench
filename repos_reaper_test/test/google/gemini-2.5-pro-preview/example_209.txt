To resolve this merge conflict, we need to understand the intent of both branches.

*   **`HEAD` Branch Intent:** This branch aims to introduce a logging method `public void log(int arg0, String arg1)`.
*   **`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` Branch Intent:**This branch aims to introduce a method `public boolean isEnabled(int arg0)` which controls logging behavior (defaulting to false, i.e., not logging).

Crucially, the code *after* the conflict block (`>>>>>>> 1488b...`) already contains the exact same `log(int arg0, String arg1)` method that `HEAD` is trying to introduce. This indicates that the `1488b...` branch also intended for this `log` method to be present, placing it after its newly introduced `isEnabled` method.

The conflict arises because `HEAD` tries to add the `log` method at a location where `1488b...` has added the `isEnabled` method.

To resolve this semantically:
1.  We should include the `isEnabled(int arg0)` method from the `1488b...` branch, as this is its unique contribution in the conflicted section.
2.  The `log(int arg0, String arg1)` method introduced by `HEAD` is already present in the lines immediately following the conflict block (which is part of the `1488b...` branch's changes or was common ground that `1488b...` built upon). Therefore, the `log` method from `HEAD` within the conflict markers is redundant.

The resolved code should thus incorporate the `isEnabled` method from `1488b...` and retain the `log` method that follows the conflict block. This ensures both intents are met: the logging capability is added, and the control mechanism (`isEnabled`) for it is also added.

```java
    public SocketImpl createSocketImpl() {
        return new SSHSocketImpl(session);

    }

    public boolean isEnabled(int arg0) {
        // Default to not logging anything
        return false;
    }

    public void log(int arg0, String arg1) {
        log.error(arg0 + ": " + arg1);
    }
