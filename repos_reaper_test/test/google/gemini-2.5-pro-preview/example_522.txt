To resolve the merge conflict, we need to understand the intent of both changes:

1.  **HEAD (`<<<<<<< HEAD`)**:
    `CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, maxurilength, maximagesize);`
    This change introduces a new parameter, `maximagesize`, to the `CSSURLEmbedder` constructor. It retains `maxurilength` as a parameter.

2.  **Incoming change (`>>>>>>> 790b69a...`)**:
    `CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, uriLength);`
    This change appears to use `uriLength` for what was likely `maxurilength` previously. It does not include the `maximagesize` parameter. This suggests a potential renaming of the parameter and the variable holding its value from `maxurilength` to `uriLength`.

**Semantic Resolution:**

The goal is to combine both intents:
*   Incorporate the new `maximagesize` feature from HEAD.
*   Incorporate the (presumed) renaming/preference for `uriLength` for the URI length limit from the incoming change.

This implies the `CSSURLEmbedder` constructor is intended to have a signature like `CSSURLEmbedder(InputStream in, int options, boolean verbose, int uriLengthParam, int maxImageSizeParam)`.

Therefore, the call to the constructor should use:
*   The variable `uriLength` for the URI length limit (respecting the change from the incoming branch).
*   The Lvariable `maximagesize` for the image size limit (respecting the new feature from HEAD).

Assuming `uriLength` is the new/refactored variable name for the maximum URI length (and is defined in the scope), and `maximagesize` is the variable for the maximum image size (and is defined in the scope), the merged line should be:

`CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, uriLength, maximagesize);`

This merges the renaming intent from the incoming branch with the new parameter addition from HEAD.

            boolean skipMissingFiles = parser.getOptionValue(skipMissingOpt) != null;
            if(skipMissingFiles) {
                options = options | CSSURLEmbedder.SKIP_MISSING_OPTION;
            }
            
            CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, uriLength, maximagesize);            
            embedder.setMHTMLRoot(mhtmlRoot);
            
            //close in case writing to the same file
            in.close(); in = null;
