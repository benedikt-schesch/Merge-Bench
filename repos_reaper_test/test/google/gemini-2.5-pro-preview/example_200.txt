To resolve the merge conflict, I will analyze the intent and semantics of the changes from both `HEAD` and `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`.

**Analysis of the Conflict:**

The conflict occurs in the spacing between the `definedCommands` field and the `packageImportList` field.
*   **HEAD's version:** Introduces a single blank line, indented with 4 spaces.
    ```java
        new HashMap<String, StreamingCommand>();
    // ^ line with 4 spaces
        private static ArrayList<String> packageImportList = new ArrayList<String>();
    ```
*   **1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309's version:** Introduces two lines:
    1.  A blank line, indented with 4 spaces.
    2.  A completely empty line (no indentation).
    ```java
        new HashMap<String, StreamingCommand>();
    // ^ line with 4 spaces
    // ^ line with 0 spaces (completely empty)
        private static ArrayList<String> packageImportList = new ArrayList<String>();
    ```

**Semantic Intent:**

Both sides intend to add vertical whitespace for separation between the field definitions. The difference lies in the amount of whitespace and its indentation.

*   `HEAD` prefers one standard, indented blank line. This aligns with common Java styling conventions (e.g., Google Java Style Guide recommends one blank line between consecutive class members).
*   `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` prefers two blank lines. However, the second blank line, as presented in the conflict, lacks indentation. This would break the visual indentation flow of the code block and is stylistically unusual and generally undesirable.

**Resolution Decision:**

Given the above:
1.  A single indented blank line (HEAD's version) is a standard and clean way to separate fields.
2.  The version from `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`, due to the unindented second blank line, is stylistically problematic. If the intent was two *indented* blank lines, the conflict representation does not accurately reflect that in a well-formatted way. Interpreting the conflict literally, HEAD's version is clearly preferable.

Therefore, I will resolve the conflict by choosing HEAD's version, which uses a single, properly indented blank line. This maintains clean formatting and adheres to common coding style practices.

**Resolved Code:**

```java
    /**
     * a table mapping names to streaming commands.
     */
    private Map<String, StreamingCommand> definedCommands = 
        new HashMap<String, StreamingCommand>();
    
    private static ArrayList<String> packageImportList = new ArrayList<String>();

    public boolean debug = true;
    
    // List of paths skipped for automatic shipping
