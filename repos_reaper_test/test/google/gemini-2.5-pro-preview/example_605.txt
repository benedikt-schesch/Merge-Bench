Both sides of the merge conflict aim to declare a Java field of type `Likes` that corresponds to a Facebook Graph API field, presumably named "likes". This field is intended to represent "The Pages that this Page Likes," as indicated by the Javadoc comment.

*   **HEAD (Left Side):**
    ```java
    @Facebook
    private Likes likes;
    ```
    This side names the Java field `likes` and uses the `@Facebook` annotation without a specific name. This implies that the Facebook Graph API field is also named "likes", and RestFB will map it by matching the field name.

*   **a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe (Right Side):**
    ```java
    @Facebook("likes")
    private Likes likesList;
    ```
    This side names the Java field `likesList`. It explicitly uses `@Facebook("likes")` to map this Java field to the Facebook Graph API field named "likes".

**Semantic Intent & Resolution:**

Both branches intend to map the same underlying Facebook data ("likes") to a `Likes` object in Java. The differences are:
1.  The Java field name: `likes` vs. `likesList`.
2.  The annotation explicitness: `@Facebook` vs. `@Facebook("likes")`.

The right side introduces two changes:
1.  It renames the Java field from (presumably) `likes` to `likesList`. This suggests an intent to make the Java field name more descriptive, perhaps to emphasize that the `Likes` object represents or contains a list of liked pages.
2.  It makes the mapping explicit with `@Facebook("likes")`. This is good practice, ensuring the correct Facebook field is mapped, especially when the Java field name differs from the Facebook field name (or even if it's the same, for clarity and robustness against refactoring).

Given that the change to `likesList` is accompanied by the necessary explicit annotation `@Facebook("likes")`, it appears to be a deliberate refinement by the author of the right side to improve the descriptiveness of the Java field name while ensuring correct API mapping. This choice suggests a preference for `likesList` as the identifier in the Java code.

Therefore, selecting the right side's version incorporates these deliberate changes.

```java
   * @RestFB.GraphApi.Since 2.6
   * @return The Pages that this Page Likes.
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  @Facebook("likes")
  private Likes likesList;

  /**
   * The number of likes the page has.
   *
   * @return The number of likes the page has

```
