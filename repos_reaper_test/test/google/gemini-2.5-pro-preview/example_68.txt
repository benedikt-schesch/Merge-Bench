To resolve the merge conflict, I've considered the semantic intent of both branches:
1.  The `HEAD` branch introduces `customDecksIds` as a `Set<Integer>`. This suggests a system for identifying custom decks using integer-based IDs, possibly from a local database or internal numbering.
2.  The `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a` branch introduces `cardcastDeckIds` as a `Set<String>`. This specifically refers to Cardcast, a known service for sharing card decks, which typically uses string-based identifiers.

Given that the types (`Integer` vs. `String`) and the names (`customDecksIds` vs. `cardcastDeckIds`) are distinct, it's most likely that these represent two different features or two different sources/types of deck IDs that the application intends to support concurrently. "Custom decks" is a general category, while "Cardcast decks" are a specific type of external deck. It's plausible for the application to support both generic custom decks (identified by integers) and Cardcast decks (identified by strings).

Therefore, the resolution is to include both fields, as they serve different semantic purposes and are not mutually exclusive.

```java
  private final ConnectedUsers connectedUsers;
  private final GameManager gameManager;
  private final Provider<Session> sessionProvider;
  private final Object blackCardLock = new Object();
  private final GameOptions options;
  private final Set<Integer> customDecksIds = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<Integer>());
  private final Set<String> cardcastDeckIds = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());
  private final Metrics metrics;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showGameLinkProvider;
  private final Provider<String> gamePermalinkFormatProvider;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showRoundLinkProvider;
