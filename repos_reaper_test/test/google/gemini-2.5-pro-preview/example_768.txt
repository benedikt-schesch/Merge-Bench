The merge conflict arises from two main differences:
1.  The data type used for `nsre_low_watermark` and `nsre_high_watermark`:
    *   `HEAD` uses `config.getInt(...)`.
    *   Branch `003c60654636b9b3dc2f3a0846a8a76a44f1fb06` uses `config.getShort(...)`.
2.  Introduction of a new configuration for `increment_buffer_durable`:
    *   Branch `003c60654636b9b3dc2f3a0846a8a76a44f1fb06` adds logic to read `hbase.increments.durable` as a boolean.
    *   `HEAD` does not have this logic.

**Intent Analysis:**

*   **`HEAD`:** Intends for `nsre_low_watermark` and `nsre_high_watermark` to be read as integers.
*   **Branch `003c60654636b9b3dc2f3a0846a8a76a44f1fb06`:**
    1.  Intends for `nsre_low_watermark` and `nsre_high_watermark` to be read as shorts. This change from `int` to `short` suggests a refinement, possibly because the expected values for these watermarks are known to fit within the range of a `short`, or to enforce such a constraint, or for minor memory efficiency.
    2.  Intends to introduce a new feature or option related to the durability of increments, configured by `hbase.increments.durable`.

**Resolution Strategy:**

The most semantically sound resolution is to incorporate all the changes from branch `003c60654636b9b3dc2f3a0846a8a76a44f1fb06`. This branch appears to make a more specific type choice for the watermarks (`short` instead of `int`) and introduces new, non-conflicting functionality (`increment_buffer_durable`). This approach assumes that the change to `short` is a deliberate refinement or correction.

The resolved code will:
1.  Use `config.getShort` for `nsre_low_watermark` and `nsre_high_watermark`.
2.  Include the new a`increment_buffer_durable` logic.

This combines the specific intent of refining the watermark types and the intent of adding new functionality, both originating from branch `003c60654636b9b3dc2f3a0846a8a76a44f1fb06`.
