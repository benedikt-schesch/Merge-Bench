To resolve the merge conflict, I will consider the semantic intent of the changes on both sides.

**HEAD branch changes:**
1.  Changed JUnit annotation from `@Before` (JUnit 4) to `@BeforeEach` (JUnit 5).
2.  Changed method visibility from `public` to package-private (by removing `public` modifier, default for methods in Java interfaces/classes).
3.  Changed list initialization from `new ArrayList<>()` to `newArrayList()` (likely using a utility method, e.g., from Guava `Lists.newArrayList`, assuming a static import).

**ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586 branch changes (original state for this part):**
1.  Uses `@Before` (JUnit 4).
2.  Method is `public`.
3.  Uses standard `new ArrayList<>()` for list initialization.

**Semantic Interpretation and Resolution:**

*   **JUnit Version:** The change from `@Before` to `@BeforeEach` indicates a migration from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5. This is generally a deliberate and significant modernization. JUnit 5 offers more features and flexibility. This intent (upgrading to JUnit 5) seems like the primary driver.
*   **Method Visibility:** JUnit 5 test methods and lifecycle methods (like those annotated with `@BeforeEach`) no longer need to be `public`. Package-private visibility (default for `void inContext()`) is common and perfectly valid in JUnit 5. This change is consistent with adopting JUnit 5.
*   **List Initialization:**
    *   `projects = new ArrayList<>();` (from `ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586`) uses the standard Java generic constructor for `ArrayList`.
    *   `projects = newArrayList();` (from `HEAD`) likely uses a static factory method, often Guava's `Lists.newArrayList()`. This is a stylistic choice and depends on whether the project uses and prefers such utilities.

**Combined Intent:**
The primary semantic intent appears to be upgrading the test setup to JUnit 5. This implies using `@BeforeEach` and allowing package-private visibility for the setup method as done in `HEAD`.

For the list initialization, both versions achieve the same semantic goal: initializing `projects` as a new, empty `ArrayList`. The choice between `new ArrayList<>()` and `newArrayList()` is largely stylistic or dependent on project conventions (e.g., use of utility libraries like Guava).
Without knowing the project's specific conventions regarding utility libraries, using the standard Java `new ArrayList<>()` is a safer and more universal choice. It fulfills the intent of initializing the list without making assumptions about specific library usage preferred by the `HEAD` committer.

Thus, the resolution will combine the JUnit 5 specific changes from `HEAD` with the standard list initialization from `ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586`.

```java
	private List<ProjectFacade> projects;
	private CoreRegistry coreRegistry;
	private ProjectSet projectSet;
	private EclipseWorkspace workspace;

	@BeforeEach
	void inContext() throws CoreException {
		projects = new ArrayList<>();
		projectSet = mock(ProjectSet.class);
		projects.add(new ProjectFacade(project));
		coreRegistry = mock(CoreRegistry.class);
		CoreFactory coreFactory = new CoreFactory(null);
		workspace = new EclipseWorkspace(projectSet, coreRegistry, coreFactory, new SystemClassPathJarLocator());
