To resolve the merge conflict, I will analyze the semantic intent of both changes.

The conflict occurs in a Javadoc comment for a method that returns a user's picture:
- **HEAD version**: `@return the user's picture as ProfilePictureSource object`
- **`a17acec...` version**: `@return the user's picture as picture object`

The HEAD version specifies a more concrete type, `ProfilePictureSource object`, which suggests that `ProfilePictureSource` is likely an actual class name in the codebase. JavaDoc comments benefit from such precision as it clarifies the API for developers.
The `a17acec...` version uses a more generic term, `picture object`. While not incorrect, it's less informative than specifying the actual class if known.

Assuming `ProfilePictureSource` is indeed the specific class used to represent the user's picture data in this library, the HEAD version is a more precise and helpful Javadoc description. It likely represents a refinement or clarification of the documentation.

The second `<<<<<<< HEAD` marker appears after `@Setter` and is followed by a blank line and the end of the code block. This is interpreted as indicating that the HEAD branch contributes a blank line at this position in the snippet, rather than being a separate, incomplete merge conflict.

Therefore, I will choose the HEAD version for the Javadoc comment, as it provides more specific information about the return type.

```java
   * The user's picture, if provided.
   *
   * To force Facebook to fill the <code>picture</code> field you have to fetch the user with the
   * <code>fields=picture</code> parameter, otherwise the picture is <code>null</code>.
   *
   * @return the user's picture as ProfilePictureSource object
   * @since 1.6.16
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
