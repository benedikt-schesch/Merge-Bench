The merge conflict occurs in a conditional statement. Let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides:

*   **HEAD version:**
    ```java
              if (playerCards != null && blackCard != null
                  && playerCards.size() == blackCard.getPick()) {
    ```
    This version checks if `playerCards` is not null, `blackCard` is not null, and the number of `playerCards` equals the `pick` count of the `blackCard`. The condition is split over two lines, with the continuation line indented.

*   **5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a version:**
    ```java
              if (playerCards != null && blackCard != null && playerCards.size() == blackCard.getPick()) {
    ```
    This version performs the exact same logical check as the HEAD version. The entire condition is on a single line.

**Semantic Analysis:**
Both pieces of code are semantically identical. They evaluate the same boolean expression to determine the flow of control. The difference lies purely in code formatting (line break and indentation).

**Resolution:**
Since the logical intent and outcome are the same, the choice is stylistic. The HEAD version introduces a line break, which can improve readability for longer conditions and is a common formatting practice. The continuation indent aligns with typical Java style guides. The single-line version from branch `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a` is also acceptable as the line length is not excessive.

Assuming the change in HEAD was a deliberate formatting choice to enhance readability or adhere to a particular style (e.g., line length limits or formatting for complex conditions), we will adopt the HEAD version's formatting. This resolves the conflict by choosing one of the two identical semantic representations based on a common stylistic preference for readability.

```java
          if (!roundPlayers.contains(player)) {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
            break;
          }
          final List<WhiteCard> playerCards = playedCards.getCards(player);
          if (playerCards != null && blackCard != null
              && playerCards.size() == blackCard.getPick()) {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
          } else {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.PLAYING;
          }
        }
