Okay, I will analyze the conflict and resolve it based on the inferred semantic intent.

The conflict is in the declaration of the `GetPhotoTask` inner class:
*   **HEAD** declares: `private class GetPhotoTask extends GenericTask {`
*   **Incoming change (3cac0b691a1f6bce876565b41eb831a0f4e82d6d)** declares: `private class GetPhotoTask extends AsyncTask<String, Void, TaskResult> {` and adds a comment `//FIXME: 换数据库后, 图片无法显示` (After changing the database, images cannot be displayed).

Let's look at the method defined within this class:
```java
        @Override
		protected TaskResult _doInBackground(TaskParams...params) {
        	TaskParams param = params[0];
            // ...
        }
```
The key elements here are:
1.  The `@Override` annotation.
2.  The method signature `_doInBackground(TaskParams...params)` returning `TaskResult`.

For the `@Override` annotation to be valid, the superclass must have a method with this exact signature that `GetPhotoTask` is overriding.

*   If `GetPhotoTask extends GenericTask` (HEAD): This is plausible if `GenericTask` is a custom class (possibly an abstraction over `AsyncTask` or a similar background task mechanism) that defines a method `protected TaskResult _doInBackground(TaskParams...params)`. This would make the `@Override` correct.

*   If `GetPhotoTask extends AsyncTask<String, Void, TaskResult>` (Incoming): The standard `android.os.AsyncTask` class requires overriding `doInBackground(Params... params)`. For `AsyncTask<String, Void, TaskResult>`, this would be `protected TaskResult doInBackground(String... params)`. The existing method `_doInBackground(TaskParams...params)` does not match this standard signature in name (underscore prefix) or parameter type (`TaskParams` vs. `String`). Therefore, the `@Override` annotation would cause a compilation error if `AsyncTask` is the direct superclass, as it does not have a `_doInBackground` method.

**Semantic Intent:**
*   **HEAD:** Aims to use a task that processes `TaskParams` and is likely based on a custom `GenericTask` framework. The structure aligns with the subsequent method override.
*   **Incoming (3cac0b691a1f6bce876565b41eb831a0f4e82d6d):** Aims to address a bug where images are not displayed after a database change. The developer attempted to modify the task, possibly by trying to switch to a standard `AsyncTask` with `String` as input. However, this change appears incomplete or incompatible with the existing `_doInBackground` method implementation.

**Resolution:**
The most consistent and likely compilable resolution is to retain the class structure from HEAD (`extends GenericTask`) because it aligns with the `@Override` annotation and the signature of the `_doInBackground` method. Standard `AsyncTask` does not provide a `_doInBackground` method to override.

The FIXME comment from the incoming branch is valuable information, indicating an unresolved issue that developers were trying to address. This comment should be preserved.

Therefore, the resolution combines the class declaration from HEAD (which maintains consistency with the method body) and the FIXME comment from the incoming change (which provides context about an existing problem). This suggests the attempt to change the superclass in the incoming branch might have been an incorrect or incomplete step in trying to fix the image display issue.

```java
	        mPhotoTask.execute(params);
        }
    }
	

	//FIXME: 换数据库后, 图片无法显示
	private class GetPhotoTask extends GenericTask {

        @Override
		protected TaskResult _doInBackground(TaskParams...params) {
        	TaskParams param = params[0];
            try {

```
