To resolve this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intentions of both changes.

**HEAD Branch Intent:**
The `HEAD` branch introduces a new private field:
```java
  /**
   * Helper to convert {@see JsonValue} into a given type
   */
  private JsonHelper jsonHelper = new JsonHelper();
```
This change aims to add an instance of `JsonHelper`. The comment indicates that this helper is intended for converting `JsonValue` objects into specific Java types. This suggests a utility component to encapsulate JSON conversion logic, likely for use within the `DefaultJsonMapper` class.

**Incoming Change (`a17acec0655b...`) Intent:**
The incoming change removes this `JsonHelper` field and its associated comment. This could mean several things:
1.  The `JsonHelper` was deemed unnecessary.
2.  Its functionality was integrated directly into other methods of `DefaultJsonMapper` or another class.
3.  `JsonHelper`'s methods were refactored to be static, so an instance field is no longer needed.
4.  This branch diverged before `JsonHelper` was introduced, or it represents a state where `JsonHelper` was explicitly removed.

**Resolution Rationale:**

The `HEAD` branch explicitly adds a `JsonHelper` instance, complete with a descriptive comment outlining its purpose. This strongly suggests an intention to use this helper for JSON conversion tasks within the `DefaultJsonMapper`. Such helpers are common for organizing and reusing conversion logic.

The incoming change, by simply deleting this block, suggests that this `JsonHelper` instance is not needed from its perspective. However, without further context from the commit `a17acec0655b...` (e.g., commit message or other changed files), it's difficult to determine if this removal is part of a larger refactoring that makes `JsonHelper` obsolete or provides an alternative.

Given the information available in the snippet:
-   The addition in `HEAD` is clear and purposeful (a helper for type conversion).
-   The removal in the incoming change lacks explicit context for *why* it's being removed (e.g., no alternative implementation is visible in this snippet).

In most cases where one branch adds a new, seemingly useful component and the other branch removes it (or doesn't have it), the resolution often favors keeping the addition, assuming it's a new feature or improvement, unless there's clear evidence it's been superseded or is problematic.

Therefore, the resolution will be to keep the `JsonHelper` field as introduced by `HEAD`. This assumes that the `JsonHelper` provides a useful, intended functionality for the `DefaultJsonMapper`.
