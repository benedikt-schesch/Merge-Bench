The conflict arises because one branch (HEAD) has no code in this specific location (or removed whatever was there), while the other branch (`790b69a...`) adds a new constructor.

**Intent of HEAD:** To have no specific constructor code at this location.
**Intent of 790b69a...:** To add an overloaded constructor `CSSURLEmbedder(Reader in, int options, boolean verbose, int maxUriLength)`. This constructor is similar to the existing one immediately preceding the conflict, but omits the `maxImageSize` parameter. This is a common pattern for providing convenience constructors.

**Resolution:**
The most semantically sound resolution is to include the new constructor from branch `790b69a...`. This adds functionality (a new way to instantiate the class) without directly conflicting with any alternative implementation logic from `HEAD` in this specific block, as `HEAD` contributes nothing here. This constructor allows creating an instance without specifying `maxImageSize`, which might then rely on a default value or be set later.

```java
        this.options = options;
        this.maxUriLength = maxUriLength;
        this.maxImageSize = maxImageSize;
    }

    public CSSURLEmbedder(Reader in, int options, boolean verbose, int maxUriLength) throws IOException {
        this.code = readCode(in);
        this.verbose = verbose;
        this.options = options;
        this.maxUriLength = maxUriLength;
    }

    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Get/Set verbose flag
    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    
    public boolean getVerbose(){

```
