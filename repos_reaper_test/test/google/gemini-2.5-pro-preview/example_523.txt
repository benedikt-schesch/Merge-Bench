The conflict shows that one side (HEAD) wants to include a field `private int maxImageSize;`, while the other side (`790b69a...`) has this line missing (either it was deleted, or never existed on that branch).

**Intent of HEAD:**
To define a private integer field named `maxImageSize`. This suggests an intention to introduce a mechanism for limiting the maximum size of images, which could be complementary to the existing `maxUriLength` field.

**Intent of 790b69a...:**
To not have the `maxImageSize` field. This could mean:
1.  The field was present in a common ancestor and this branch/commit deliberately removed it (e.g., it was deprecated, refactored, or found to be unnecessary).
2.  The field was never present in this line of development, and HEAD is attempting to introduce it.

**Semantic Ambiguity:**
Without knowing the history of these branches or the specific changes in commit `790b69a...`, it's impossible to be certain about the correct resolution.
*   If `maxImageSize` is a new feature being introduced by HEAD, it should likely be kept.
*   If `maxImageSize` is a field that was deliberately removed by `790b69a...` (e.g., as part of a cleanup or refactoring), then re-introducing it would be incorrect.

Since the intent is ambiguous and a wrong resolution could either discard a new feature or reintroduce obsolete code, it is safest to preserve the conflict for a human developer with more context to decide.
