Okay, I will analyze the conflict and provide the resolved version.

The conflict is:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
```
This conflict is situated between two block comments:
```java

 * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.

 * limitations under the License.

// Conflict is here

```

Let's break down the changes from each side:
-   **`HEAD` side:**
    ```java

    ```
    This side introduces a single blank line. The semantic intent here is likely to improve readability by visually separating the two distinct comment blocks.

-   **`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` side:**
    ```java
    ```
    This side introduces no content between the two comment blocks, meaning the second comment block would immediately follow the first. The intent could be to maintain a more compact style, or this section was unchanged from the common ancestor and the other branch (`HEAD`) made the modification.

**Resolution:**
Adding a blank line between distinct multi-line comment blocks is a common practice to enhance code readability. It helps to visually chunk information, making the code easier to scan and understand.
Unless there's a specific project style guide that mandates no empty lines in such contexts, the change from `HEAD` (adding a blank line) is generally preferred as it makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

Therefore, the resolution will be to accept the change from `HEAD`, which is to insert a blank line between the two comment blocks.
