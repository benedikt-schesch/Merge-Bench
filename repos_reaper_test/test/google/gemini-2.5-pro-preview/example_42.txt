The merge conflict is purely stylistic, concerning the formatting of the `throws` clause in the `addSpectator` method signature. Both versions are semantically identical: they declare a method `addSpectator` that takes a `User` object and can throw `TooManySpectatorsException` and `IllegalStateException`.

-   The `HEAD` version formats the `throws` clause over two lines, with `IllegalStateException` on a new line, indented.
-   The version from commit `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a` (let's call it "theirs") formats the `throws` clause on a single line.

The single-line version from `5adedd2...` is:
`  public void addSpectator(final User user) throws TooManySpectatorsException, IllegalStateException {`
This line has a total length of 84 characters (including the initial 2-space indent). This length is acceptable under many common Java style guides (e.g., those with 100 or 120 character line limits).

The multi-line version from `HEAD` is:
`  public void addSpectator(final User user) throws TooManySpectatorsException,`
`      IllegalStateException {`
This formatting (breaking the line after a comma and indenting the continuation line by +4 spaces relative to the statement's starting indent) is also a standard practice, often employed when line length limits are stricter (e.g., 80 characters) or for enhanced readability with longer lists.

Since the semantic intent is identical, the choice is stylistic. Assuming that changes incoming from another branch (like `5adedd2...`) might represent an evolution of the codebase's style (e.g., application of a project-wide auto-formatter preferring more compact lines if they fit within a reasonable limit), the single-line version is chosen. This often aids in reducing diff noise if such a formatting style is being consistently applied.

```java
   *
   * @param user Spectator to add to this game.
   * @throws TooManySpectatorsException Thrown if this game is at its maximum spectator capacity.
   * @throws IllegalStateException      Thrown if {@code user} is already in a game.
   */
  public void addSpectator(final User user) throws TooManySpectatorsException, IllegalStateException {
    logger.info(String.format("%s joined game %d as a spectator.", user.toString(), id));
    synchronized (spectators) {
      if (spectators.size() >= options.spectatorLimit) {
        throw new TooManySpectatorsException();
      }

```
