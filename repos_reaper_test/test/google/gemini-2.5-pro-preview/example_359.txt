The merge conflict appears to show a duplicated Javadoc paragraph. The `HEAD` version contains a paragraph that is identical to the paragraph immediately following the conflict markers. The other branch (`01a6cc54669b5ebf1ea1c3e27e424bba99a0ef3c`) has an empty change in the conflict zone, indicating it does not have this first instance of the paragraph.

The semantic intent seems to be to have this documentation paragraph appear only once. Resolving the conflict by removing the `HEAD` portion (which is identical to the subsequent common block) achieves this.

```java
   * parameter is the declared field class. Declared fields of type {@link Collection} are used to
   * support repeating data key names, so each member of the collection is an additional data key
   * value. They are parsed the same as "primitive" fields, except that the generic type parameter
   * of the collection is used as the {@link Class} parameter.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
