The conflict arises from the use of two different variable names, `myKey` (in `HEAD`) and `keyWritable` (in `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`), to refer to the key being processed. Both branches are attempting to perform the same semantic operation:
1. Initialize a `curKey` with the key to be processed.
2. If this key is wrapped (and other conditions `!sameMapKeyType && !inCombiner && isKeyWrapped.get(index)` are met), unwrap it by casting its value to a `Tuple`, extracting the actual key from the tuple, and updating `curKey`.

The core logic is identical. The only difference is the identifier used for the input key. This often happens if one branch renames a variable while the other branch continues to use the old name for modifications or new logic.

Without knowing the context in which `myKey` and `keyWritable` are declared (e.g., as local variables, method parameters, or fields) and which name is canonical or correct in the merged version of the surrounding code, it's impossible to definitively choose one over the other. For instance:
- If the variable was renamed from `myKey` to `keyWritable` across the codebase in branch `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`, then `keyWritable` would be the correct choice.
- Conversely, if `keyWritable` was renamed to `myKey` in `HEAD`, then `myKey` would be correct.
- If `myKey` and `keyWritable` are distinct variables in scope (e.g., a field and a parameter), then the two branches had fundamentally different intents about *which* key to operate on. This would be a more complex semantic conflict. However, the identical structure of the conditional block strongly suggests they refer to the same logical key.

Since the correct choice of variable name depends on declarations or conventions outside the provided snippet, and choosing incorrectly could lead to compilation errors (if the chosen variable is not defined in scope) or subtle bugs (if both are defined but refer to different data), the safest approach is to preserve the conflict markers for a human developer to resolve with the full context of the file.

```java
        Packager pkgr = packagers.get(index);

        // check to see if we need to unwrap the key. The keys may be
        // wrapped inside a tuple by LocalRearrange operator when jobs
        // with different map key types are merged
<<<<<<< HEAD
        PigNullableWritable curKey = myKey;
        if (!sameMapKeyType && !inCombiner && isKeyWrapped.get(index)) {
            Tuple tup = (Tuple)myKey.getValueAsPigType();
