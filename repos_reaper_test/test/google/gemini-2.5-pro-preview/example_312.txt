To resolve the merge conflict, I'll analyze the intent of both branches:

*   **`HEAD` branch intent:**
    1.  It appears to replace or repurpose the primary API instance `mApi` to be of type `Weibo`, indicated by `public static Weibo mApi; // new API`.
    2.  It adds a static `Context` reference: `public static Context mContext;`.

*   **`de460f053e7948460b81e71a410d665d956db90a` branch (let's call it "feature branch") intent:**
    1.  It preserves (or re-introduces) `public static TwitterApi mApi;`.
    2.  It adds a new API instance for Weibo, named `nApi`: `public static Weibo nApi; // new API`.
    3.  It adds a new database helper: `public static DatabaseHelper mDb2;`.

**Semantic Resolution:**

The application's name `TwitterApplication` and the existing `TwitterDbAdapter mDb` suggest that Twitter functionality is likely being retained.
Both branches intend to introduce a `Weibo` API.

1.  **API Instances (`mApi`, `nApi`):**
    *   The feature branch's approach of keeping `TwitterApi mApi` and adding a distinct `Weibo nApi` allows the application to support both Twitter and Weibo services simultaneously.
    *   HEAD's change of `mApi` to `Weibo mApi` might break existing code expecting `mApi` to be a `TwitterApi`.
    *   Therefore, it's semantically safer and more additive to preserve `TwitterApi mApi` for Twitter and use `Weibo nApi` for the new Weibo API. This incorporates the intent of both branches to have Weibo support, while explicitly keeping Twitter support via `mApi`.

2.  **Context (`mContext`):**
    *   HEAD adds `public static Context mContext;`. This is a common and generally useful addition for an Android `Application` class and does not conflict with other changes.

3.  **New Database Helper (`mDb2`):**
    *   The feature branch adds `public static DatabaseHelper mDb2;`. This is a new component and can be added alongside other changes.

**Combined Resolution:**

The most sensible merge is to combine all unique additions, ensuring that the application can support both existing (Twitter) and new (Weibo) functionalities:

*   Keep `public static TwitterApi mApi;` (from the feature branch, preserving Twitter API access).
*   Add `public static Weibo nApi; // new API` (from the feature branch, providing the Weibo API access, which also fulfills HEAD's intent for a Weibo API).
*   Add `public static Context mContext;` (from HEAD).
*   Add `public static DatabaseHelper mDb2;` (from the feature branch).

This resolution integrates the features from both branches in a non-destructive way.

```java
  
  public static final String TAG = "TwitterApplication";
  
  public static ImageManager mImageManager;
  public static TwitterDbAdapter mDb; 
  public static TwitterApi mApi;
  public static Weibo nApi; // new API
  public static Context mContext;
  public static DatabaseHelper mDb2; 

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
