Okay, I will analyze the conflict and resolve it based on the likely semantic intent.

**Conflict Analysis:**

*   **HEAD:** Introduces the `@Beta` annotation for the `trustCertificates` method.
    *   *Intent:* To mark this method (or this specific overload/functionality related to mTLS) as being in a "beta" stage, meaning it's publicly available but potentially unstable or subject to change. This is common for new or significantly modified APIs.
*   **Branch `51762f221ec8ab38da03149c8012e63aec0433dc`:** Does not have the `@Beta` annotation for this method.
    *   *Intent:* This could mean either the method was considered stable in this branch, or this branch diverged before the `@Beta` annotation was added, or the annotation was explicitly removed to signify stabilization.

**Resolution Rationale:**

The method `trustCertificates` is being defined with parameters specific to mTLS (`mtlsKeyStore`, `mtlsKeyStorePassword`). When new functionality, especially complex features like mTLS support, is added or significantly modified, it's common practice to mark the corresponding API elements with `@Beta`.

Assuming that the changes in `HEAD` involve the introduction or significant modification of this mTLS-related `trustCertificates` method, the addition of `@Beta` is a deliberate signal from the developer about its current stability.

It is generally safer to err on the side of caution by keeping an API marked as `@Beta` if there's any doubt. If the API is indeed stable, the `@Beta` annotation can be removed later. Prematurely removing it could mislead users if the API is not yet finalized.

Therefore, the most likely and safest semantic resolution is to accept the change from `HEAD` and keep the `@Beta` annotation. This signals that this specific version of the `trustCertificates` method, particularly with its mTLS capabilities, is considered to be in a beta state.

```java
     *     or {@link SecurityUtils#loadKeyStoreFromCertificates})
     * @param mtlsKeyStore key store for client certificate and key to establish mutual TLS. (use
     *     for example {@link SecurityUtils#createMtlsKeyStore(InputStream)})
     * @param mtlsKeyStorePassword password for mtlsKeyStore parameter
     */
    @Beta
    public Builder trustCertificates(
        KeyStore trustStore, KeyStore mtlsKeyStore, String mtlsKeyStorePassword)
        throws GeneralSecurityException {
      if (mtlsKeyStore != null && mtlsKeyStore.size() > 0) {
        this.isMtls = true;

```
