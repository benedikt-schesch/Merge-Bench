Okay, I will help you resolve this merge conflict.

    Looking at the conflict:

    **First Conflict Block (variable `text`):**
    *   **Branch `HEAD`:**
        *   Uses the phrase "resource access permissions".
        *   The warning about functionality states: "...the functionality is not identical to the export you just imported."
        *   Formats the list of missing principals using `String.join("</li><li>", missingPrincipals)`.
    *   **Branch `83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965`:**
        *   Uses the term "grants". The linked Structr documentation (`fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf`) mentions "Permissions (Grants)", suggesting "grants" is an accepted term.
        *   The warning about functionality adds an exclamation mark for emphasis: "...the functionality is not identical to the export you just imported!"
        *   Formats the list of missing principals using `missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>"))`, which notably includes sorting the list.

    **Semantic Resolution for `text` variable:**
    1.  **Wording ("grants" vs. "resource access permissions"):** "Grants" appears to be a recognized term in the project context and is slightly more concise. We'll adopt "grants".
    2.  **Emphasis ("!"):** Adding an exclamation mark is a minor stylistic change that enhances the warning's impact. We'll include it.
    3.  **List Formatting (Sorting):** Sorting the list of missing principals (`stream().sorted().collect(...)`) is a clear improvement for readability and consistency, especially for longer lists. We'll use this version.

    Therefore, for the `text` variable, the changes from branch `83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965` are preferable. The line `+ "Consider adding these principals..."` is common code immediately following this conflict block and will be part of the resolved `text` definition.

    **Second Conflict Block (within `logger.info`):**
    The snippet provided ends with:
    ```java
    						+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
    <<<<<<< HEAD

    ```
    This indicates the start of a second conflict. However, the `=======` and `>>>>>>> other_branch` parts of this second conflict are not included in the provided snippet. Without the complete context for this second conflict (i.e., what the other branch proposes for this section), I cannot semantically resolve it.

    As per your instructions, if unsure or the intent is ambiguous (due to incomplete information for the second conflict), I will return the snippet with the conflict preserved for that part.

    **Resolved Code:**
    I will resolve the first conflict as described above and leave the second conflict marker (`<<<<<<< HEAD`) as it was presented at the end of the snippet, because its corresponding `=======` and `>>>>>>>` sections are not provided.

```java
			applyConfigurationFileIfExists(ctx, postDeployConfFile, DEPLOYMENT_IMPORT_STATUS);

			if (!missingPrincipals.isEmpty()) {

				final String title = "Missing Principal(s)";
				final String text = "The following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during <b>deployment</b>.<br>"
						+ "Because of these missing grants/ownerships, <b>the functionality is not identical to the export you just imported</b>!"
						+ "<ul><li>" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>")) + "</li></ul>"
						+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf\">pre-deploy.conf</a> and re-importing.";

				logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
						+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
