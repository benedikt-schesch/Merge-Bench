The conflict arises from two different class types being used for the `ClassOption`'s `requiredType` parameter: `LocalClassifierAdapter.class` (from HEAD) versus `LocalLearner.class` (from branch `40d31d67633f703171421ba4d73bb421d89a32db`). The default value string, `SimpleClassifierAdapter.class.getName()`, remains the same on both sides.

**Intent Analysis:**
*   **HEAD:** Intends for the `learner` option to accept types assignable to `LocalClassifierAdapter`.
*   **Branch `40d31d67633f703171421ba4d73bb421d89a32db`:** Intends for the `learner` option to accept types assignable to `LocalLearner`. Additionally, this branch introduces an extra blank line (indented with a tab) after the `ClassOption` definition.

**Semantic Resolution:**
Typically, in object-oriented design and API evolution:
1.  `Learner` is often a more general or base concept (e.g., an interface or abstract base class) than a specific `Adapter` class.
2.  It's common for an adapter like `LocalClassifierAdapter` to implement or extend a more general `Learner` interface/class (i.e., `LocalClassifierAdapter IS-A LocalLearner`).
3.  If this is the case, changing the `requiredType` from `LocalClassifierAdapter.class` to `LocalLearner.class` makes the option more flexible. It allows any `LocalLearner` implementation to be used, not just `LocalClassifierAdapter` or its subtypes. This is generally a positive refinement.
4.  The option is semantically for a "learner" ("Classifier to train."), making `LocalLearner.class` a very fitting type.

Assuming `LocalLearner` represents a more general type for learners in this context and `LocalClassifierAdapter` is a more specific type (possibly implementing/extending `LocalLearner`), the change from branch `40d31d67633f703171421ba4d73bb421d89a32db` to use `LocalLearner.class` is likely an intentional generalization or refactoring to improve flexibility. The class `SimpleClassifierAdapter` (used as default) would need to be assignable to `LocalLearner` for this to be valid, which it would be if it extends/implements `LocalClassifierAdapter` and `LocalClassifierAdapter` in turn extends/implements `LocalLearner`.

Therefore, the resolution favors the version from branch `40d31d67633f703171421ba4d73bb421d89a32db`, including its introduction of an indented blank line for spacing.
