The merge conflict occurs in a JUnit test method that is annotated with `@Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)`. This annotation means that the test will pass if a `FacebookJsonMappingException` is thrown during its execution, and fail otherwise (including if no exception or a different type of exception is thrown).

The `HEAD` version includes the line:
`failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(FacebookJsonMappingException.class);`

This line would typically cause the test to fail if the code execution reaches it, signifying that the expected exception was not thrown by the preceding statement (`new Connection<User>(...)`).

The other version (from commit `a17acec0655b...`) has no content in this part of the diff, meaning it effectively removes or omits this `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown` line.

**Semantic Analysis:**
*   **Intent of `HEAD`:** To explicitly fail the test if the `new Connection<User>(...)` call does not throw a `FacebookJsonMappingException`. This is a "belt and suspenders" approach when `@Test(expected=...)` is already used.
*   **Intent of `a17acec0655b...` (the other branch):** To rely solely on the `@Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)` annotation to handle the pass/fail logic concerning the expected exception. If the exception is thrown, JUnit passes the test. If it's not thrown, JUnit fails the test.

The line `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(FacebookJsonMappingException.class)` is redundant when `@Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)` is used. If the `new Connection<User>(...)` call throws the expected exception, the `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown` line is never reached. If no exception is thrown (or a different one is thrown), JUnit's `expected` mechanism will already correctly fail the test.

Therefore, removing the redundant line (as done by the `a17acec0655b...` side of the conflict) results in cleaner and more idiomatic JUnit code. The semantic intent of ensuring the test fails if the specific exception isn't thrown is already covered by the `@Test(expected = ...)` annotation.

The resolution is to accept the change from `a17acec0655b...`, which means removing the `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown` line.

```java
  }

  @Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)
  public void checkNullJson() {
    new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST), null, User.class);
  }

  @Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)
  public void checkInvalidJson() {
    new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST), "{", User.class);

```
