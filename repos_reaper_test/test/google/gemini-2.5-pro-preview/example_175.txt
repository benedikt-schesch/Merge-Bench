Both `HEAD` and `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` intend to add the same two lines of code within the `try` block:
```java
parser.setInteractive(false);
parser.parseStopOnError();
```
The semantic intent is identical. The only difference is the indentation of these lines.
- `HEAD` places these lines at an 8-space indentation.
- `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` places them at a 12-space indentation.

Looking at the surrounding code for consistent styling:
- The `try {` statement is at an 8-space indentation.
- The `catch (Exception e) {` statement is also at an 8-space indentation.
- The code inside the `catch` block (e.g., `Exception pe = Utils.getPermissionException(e);`) starts at a 12-space indentation.
This implies a standard 4-space indentation for code within blocks relative to the block opening.
Therefore, the code within the `try` block should also start at a 12-space indentation (8 spaces for `try` + 4 spaces indent).

The version from `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` (with 12-space indentation) is consistent with this prevailing style. Thus, it is the preferred resolution for this conflict.

The snippet provided also includes a trailing `<<<<<<< HEAD` line, which appears to be the start of another, incomplete merge conflict. As per the instructions to not modify context and to return the snippet with the conflict if unsure or ambiguous, this incomplete marker will be preserved as it is part of the provided context and cannot be resolved without its corresponding `=======` and `>>>>>>>` parts.

```java
        parser.parseContOnError();
    }

    public void exec() throws Throwable {
        try {
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Exception pe = Utils.getPermissionException(e);
            if (pe != null)
                log.error("You don't have permission to perform the operation. Error from the server: " + pe.getMessage());
<<<<<<< HEAD
