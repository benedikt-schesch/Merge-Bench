To resolve the merge conflict, I need to understand the intent behind the changes from both `HEAD` and the incoming commit `61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7`.

The conflict is in the definition of the `isNotEqualTo` method:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected){
=======
  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
```

*   **HEAD's version:** `public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected){`
*   **Commit `61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7`'s version:** `public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {`

**Intent Analysis:**
Both versions of the code are defining the exact same method in terms of name, return type (`ByteAssert`), and parameter (`byte expected`). The only difference is a single space character before the opening curly brace `{` in the method signature. This is a purely stylistic difference.

**Resolution Strategy:**
The semantic intent is identical. The common Java coding convention is to include a space before the opening curly brace of a method definition for better readability. Therefore, the version from commit `61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7` is stylistically preferred.

I will choose the version: `public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {`

The rest of the provided snippet, including other potential conflict markers not part of this specific `isNotEqualTo` conflict, will be preserved as "context" according to the instructions.

```java
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
