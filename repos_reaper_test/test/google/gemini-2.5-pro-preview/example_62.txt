The merge conflict occurs in a `logger.info` statement. Both sides of the conflict are trying to log the exact same message with the same parameters (`id` and `playersToRemove.size()`). The difference lies purely in the formatting of the `String.format` call:
-   `HEAD` formats the `String.format` call over multiple lines.
-   Branch `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a` has the `String.format` call on a single line.

**Intent and Semantics:**
-   **HEAD:** The intent is to log the specified message. The multi-line formatting for `String.format` suggests an aim for improved readability, especially as the single-line version would be quite long (approximately 120-125 characters for the statement itself, excluding indentation).
-   **Branch `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a`:** The intent is also to log the exact same message. The single-line formatting might be due to an automated formatter with different rules, or it might be the original state before `HEAD` refactored for readability.

**Resolution:**
Since the semantic outcome (the logged message) is identical in both versions, the decision comes down to style and readability. Long lines of code can hinder readability. The multi-line formatting in `HEAD` breaks down the long `String.format` call, making it easier to read, which is a common practice in Java development to adhere to line length limits and improve code clarity.

Therefore, preserving the multi-line formatting from `HEAD` is the preferred resolution as it likely enhances readability.

```java

    synchronized (playedCards) {
      if (state == GameState.PLAYING || playersToRemove.size() == 0) {
        // not sure how much of this check is actually required
        if (players.size() < 3 || playedCards.size() < 2) {
          logger.info(String.format(
              "Resetting game %d due to insufficient players after removing %d idle players.",
              id, playersToRemove.size()));
          resetState(true);
        } else {
          judgingState();
        }
      }

```
