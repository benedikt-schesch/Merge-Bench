Okay, I will resolve the conflict in the `text` variable by incorporating the changes from branch `83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965` as they enhance the warning message with sorted principals, potentially more accurate terminology ("grants"), and appropriate emphasis ("!").

The second conflict marker `<<<<<<< HEAD` is incomplete in the provided snippet (it lacks the `=======` and `>>>>>>>` parts). Due to this ambiguity and the instruction to return the conflict if unsure, I will resolve the first conflict and leave the second marker as it was provided.

Here is the code with the first conflict resolved and the second conflict marker preserved:

```java
		applyConfigurationFileIfExists(context, source.resolve("post-data-deploy.conf"), DEPLOYMENT_DATA_IMPORT_STATUS);

		if (!missingPrincipals.isEmpty()) {

			final String title = "Missing Principal(s)";
			final String text = "The following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during <b>data deployment</b>.<br>"
					+ "Because of these missing grants/ownerships, <b>node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported</b>!"
					+ "<ul><li>" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>")) + "</li></ul>"
					+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf\">pre-data-deploy.conf</a> and re-importing.";

			logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
					+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
