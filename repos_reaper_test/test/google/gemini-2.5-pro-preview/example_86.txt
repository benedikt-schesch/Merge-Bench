The merge conflict is in the parameter list of the `updateGameSettings` method.
- The HEAD branch adds `newMaxBlanks` and `newUseTimer`. It places `newMaxBlanks` after `newCardSets`.
- The `4584f06e...` branch (let's call it "Branch B") adds `newMaxSpectators`. It places `newMaxSpectators` before `newCardSets`.
- Both branches include `newCardSets`, `newPassword`, and `newUseTimer` in their respective modified signatures.

The semantic intent of both branches is to add more configurable parameters to the `updateGameSettings` method. A common resolution is to include parameters from both branches. The method body already includes the line `this.maxSpectators = newMaxSpectators;`, which indicates that the `newMaxSpectators` parameter is expected. We will also include `newMaxBlanks` from HEAD.

The order will respect the relative placement of the new parameters from each branch:
1.  `newScoreGoal` (existing)
2.  `newMaxPlayers` (existing)
3.  `newMaxSpectators` (from Branch B, placed before `newCardSets`)
4.  `newCardSets` (common to both views in conflict)
5.  `newMaxBlanks` (from HEAD, placed after `newCardSets`)
6.  `newPassword` (common to both views in conflict)
7.  `newUseTimer` (common to both views in conflict, effectively the last parameter)

The formatting will try to respect the line breaks and indentation shown in the conflict.

```java
  public String getPassword() {
    return password;
  }

  public void updateGameSettings(final int newScoreGoal, final int newMaxPlayers,
      final int newMaxSpectators,
      final Set<CardSet> newCardSets, final int newMaxBlanks, final String newPassword,
      final boolean newUseTimer) {
    this.scoreGoal = newScoreGoal;
    this.maxPlayers = newMaxPlayers;
    this.maxSpectators = newMaxSpectators;
    synchronized (this.cardSets) {
      this.cardSets.clear();
