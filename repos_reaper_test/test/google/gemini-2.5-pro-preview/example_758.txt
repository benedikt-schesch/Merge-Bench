Given the conflicting values for `JVM_STARTUP_WAIT_TIME_MS`, and without further information on the specific reasons or context behind each change (e.g., whether one was to fix flakiness by increasing timeout, or the other to speed up tests by decreasing it), the intent is ambiguous. Both 2000ms and 5000ms are plausible timeout values. Choosing one over the other would be an arbitrary decision without understanding the underlying motivations for each change. Therefore, it is best to present the conflict as is for a human developer to resolve with more contextual knowledge.

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class ExitHookTest {

    private static final int KEY = 1;
<<<<<<< HEAD
