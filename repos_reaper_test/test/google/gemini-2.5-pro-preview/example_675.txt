Okay, I will analyze the merge conflict and resolve it based on the intent and semantics of the code.

**Analysis of the Conflict:**

The conflict occurs in the declaration of the `accessToken` variable:

*   **HEAD:** `AccessToken accessToken = null;`
*   **Branch `12df1c5d0ecdb9e47b22b81db0329cc0f17054d6`:** `OAuthConsumerToken accessToken = null;`

Let's look at the surrounding code to understand the context:

1.  `List<AccessToken> accessTokens = jdbcTemplate.query(...)`: A list named `accessTokens` is being populated. The generic type of this list is `AccessToken`.
2.  The `RowMapper` provided to `jdbcTemplate.query` is explicitly typed as `RowMapper<AccessToken>`.
3.  Inside the `mapRow` method of the `RowMapper`, new objects are created using `return new AccessToken(rs.getString("accessToken"), rs.getString("secret"), rs.getString("provider"));`. This means the list `accessTokens` will indeed contain instances of the `AccessToken` class.
4.  Later, the code attempts to get an element from this list: `accessToken = accessTokens.get(0);`. Since `accessTokens` is a `List<AccessToken>`, the `get(0)` method will return an object of type `AccessToken`.

**Semantic Intent:**

*   **HEAD's Intent:** The intent is to declare the `accessToken` variable with the same type (`AccessToken`) as the objects being retrieved from the `accessTokens` list. This is locally consistent with the data being handled.
*   **Branch `12df1c5d0ecdb9e47b22b81db0329cc0f17054d6`'s Intent:** The intent is to declare the `accessToken` variable as `OAuthConsumerToken`. This would be semantically correct if:
    *   `AccessToken` is a subtype of `OAuthConsumerToken` (e.g., `class AccessToken extends OAuthConsumerToken` or `class AccessToken implements OAuthConsumerToken`). In this case, assigning an `AccessToken` instance to an `OAuthConsumerToken` variable is a valid upcast.
    *   The overall design is moving towards using `OAuthConsumerToken` as the primary type for such tokens, and this change is part of that larger refactoring.

**Resolution Decision:**

Given the code within the snippet:

*   The `RowMapper` explicitly creates `AccessToken` instances.
*   The list `accessTokens` is therefore a `List<AccessToken>`.
*   The assignment `accessToken = accessTokens.get(0);` means an `AccessToken` instance is being assigned to the `accessToken` variable.

For this assignment to be valid, the `accessToken` variable must be of type `AccessToken` or a supertype of `AccessToken`.

Declaring `accessToken` as `AccessToken` (as in HEAD) is always type-safe and consistent with the RDBMS mapping logic shown.

Declaring `accessToken` as `OAuthConsumerToken` (as in branch `12df1c5d...`) is only type-safe if `AccessToken` is a subtype of `OAuthConsumerToken`. Without knowing the class hierarchy, this introduces a potential type mismatch error if `AccessToken` is not assignable to `OAuthConsumerToken`.

To ensure local consistency and type safety based *only* on the provided snippet, using `AccessToken` is the more robust choice. It aligns directly with the type of objects being created and retrieved by the `RowMapper`. While `OAuthConsumerToken` could be a valid generalization if the class hierarchy supports it and the method's contract (e.g., return type) requires it, this is not evident from the snippet alone.

Therefore, I will resolve the conflict by choosing the `HEAD` version, as it maintains direct consistency with the explicit type (`AccessToken`) being instantiated and handled by the `RowMapper`.

```java
		Account account = (Account) principal;
		List<AccessToken> accessTokens = jdbcTemplate.query(SELECT_TOKEN_SQL, new RowMapper<AccessToken>() {
			public AccessToken mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException {
				return new AccessToken(rs.getString("accessToken"), rs.getString("secret"), rs.getString("provider"));
			}
				}, account.getId(), resourceId);
		AccessToken accessToken = null;
		if (accessTokens.size() > 0) {
			accessToken = accessTokens.get(0);
		}
		return accessToken;
	}

```
