The conflict arises from two different ways to get the number of elements from a `JSONArray` object: `textParts.size()` versus `textParts.length()`.

**Intent of HEAD:**
The code `final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.size());` intends to initialize an `ArrayList` with a capacity equal to the number of elements in `textParts`. The method `size()` is standard for classes implementing `java.util.Collection` (like `ArrayList` itself) and is also used by several JSON libraries such as Gson (`com.google.gson.JsonArray`), Jackson (`com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ArrayNode`), and `org.json.simple.JSONArray` (which extends `ArrayList`).

**Intent of the other branch (5adedd2...):**
The code `final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());` also intends to initialize an `ArrayList` with a capacity equal to the number of elements in `textParts`. The method `length()` is used by `org.json.JSONArray`. Native Java arrays also use `.length` (as a field). The path for this change indicates it was made in `CardcastFormatHelper.java`.

**Analysis of Ambiguity:**
The correct method (`size()` or `length()`) depends entirely on the specific class/type of the `textParts` variable, which is declared as `JSONArray`. Without seeing the import statement for `JSONArray`, it's impossible to definitively know which method is correct.
1.  If `JSONArray` is from `org.json` (i.e., `org.json.JSONArray`), then `length()` is the correct method, and `size()` would likely cause a compilation error.
2.  If `JSONArray` is from libraries like `org.json.simple`, Gson, Jackson, or `javax.json`, then `size()` is the correct method, and `length()` would likely cause a compilation error.

The conflict also includes a difference in file paths (`CustomCardFormatHelper.java` vs. `CardcastFormatHelper.java`). This suggests that the two versions of the code might have existed in slightly different contexts:
*   `CustomCardFormatHelper.java` (HEAD) might be intended for use with "custom sets" that use a JSON library where `.size()` is appropriate.
*   `CardcastFormatHelper.java` (other branch) might have been adapted for "Cardcast", which could use a different JSON library (like `org.json.JSONArray`) where `.length()` is appropriate.

If these contexts imply different underlying `JSONArray` implementations, then merging the change from the `Cardcast` context (i.e., using `length()`) into the `CustomCardFormatHelper` context might be incorrect if `CustomCardFormatHelper` is meant to continue using a JSON library compatible with `size()`. Conversely, if the project is standardizing on `org.json.JSONArray`, then `length()` would be the correct choice globally.

Given this ambiguity regarding the specific `JSONArray` implementation and the project's strategy for JSON processing, it is safest not to make an assumption and to leave the conflict for a human developer with more project-specific knowledge to resolve.

```java
  private CustomCardFormatHelper() {
  }

  public static String formatBlackCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // TODO this is going to need some work to look pretty.

      strs.add((String) o);

    final String text = StringUtils.join(strs, "____");
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml11(text);
