Given the ambiguity of the term `testBtn` (it could be a temporary button for development/testing purposes or a button for a user-facing "test" feature), and `followBtn` which clearly indicates a user-facing feature, it is not possible to definitively determine the combined semantic intent without more context. Resolving this automatically risks either discarding a valid feature or incorporating temporary developer code. Therefore, the conflict should be presented for manual review.

```java
	private static class ViewHolder {
		public ImageView profileImage;
		public TextView screenName;
		public TextView userId;
		public TextView lastStatus;
<<<<<<< HEAD
		public TextView followBtn;
=======
		public TextView testBtn;
>>>>>>> 66827e951a3a7f558f4174b3bd6fbe5bf3fa50d8
	}

	@Override
	public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
		View view;

```
