Both branches aim to handle cases where a generated data URI string (`uriString`) might exceed a defined maximum length (`maxUriLength`).

*   **HEAD branch:**
    1.  Checks if `uriString.length() > maxUriLength`.
    2.  If true, it prints a `[WARNING]` message mentioning "bytes" and appends the original `url` to the `builder`.
    3.  It then has an `else if` with the *exact same condition* (`uriString.length() > maxUriLength`). This block would print an `[INFO]` message mentioning "characters".
    4.  The `builder.append(url)` line that appears after the conflict markers and before the final `else` would logically execute as part of this `else if` block in HEAD's view.
    Due to the identical conditions, the `else if` block in HEAD is effectively unreachable dead code. If the first `if` is true, its body executes, and the `else if` is skipped. If the first `if` is false, the `else if` (with the same condition) will also be false.
    The effective logic of HEAD, due to this unreachable code, is: if too long, print WARNING (bytes) and append `url`.

*   **Remote branch (790b69a0bd40e3ab536f9c6568748f981b3d525e):**
    1.  Checks if `uriString.length() > maxUriLength`.
    2.  If true, it prints the same `[WARNING]` message mentioning "bytes".
    3.  It removes HEAD's initial `builder.append(url)` and the entire redundant `else if` block.
    4.  The `builder.append(url)` line that appears after the conflict markers and before the final `else` becomes the statement executed if the `if` condition is true.
    The logic is: if too long, print WARNING (bytes) and append `url`.

**Resolution:**
The remote branch's version is cleaner and achieves the same effective semantic outcome as HEAD because HEAD's `else if` block is redundant. Both versions correctly fall back to appending the original `url` if the generated `uriString` is deemed too long. The remote version simply removes the dead code path.

The resolved code adopts the simplification from the remote branch:

```java
                        
                        if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength) {
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                            }      
                            builder.append(url);
                        } else {
