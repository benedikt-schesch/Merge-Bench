The conflict involves an import statement for `org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.DoNotUse`.
`HEAD` includes this import, suggesting that the `DoNotUse` annotation is being used somewhere in the code in this branch.
The other version (`f2aea1563fc4d150c8231efbb2ad89a0a539f166`) does not include this import. This could mean either the annotation was never used, or its usage (and thus the import) was removed in this branch.

The semantic intent of `HEAD` is to use the `DoNotUse` annotation, requiring the import.
The semantic intent of `f2aea1563fc4d150c8231efbb2ad89a0a539f166` is not to use this annotation, or to reflect a state where it's not used, hence the absence of the import.

Resolving this conflict correctly requires knowing whether the `DoNotUse` annotation is actually used in the merged version of the code body.
- If the merged code contains usages of `@DoNotUse` (likely introduced or retained by changes from `HEAD`), then the import is necessary.
- If the merged code does not contain any usages of `@DoNotUse` (either because `HEAD`'s usages were removed or overridden by changes from `f2aea1563fc4d150c8231efbb2ad89a0a539f166` that removed them), then the import is unnecessary.

Since the provided snippet only shows the import statements and not the code body where `DoNotUse` might be used, the ultimate need for this import in the merged file cannot be definitively determined. Making a choice would be based on an assumption about the changes in the rest of the file. Therefore, the intent is ambiguous from the given information.

Following the instruction "If you are not sure on how to resolve the conflict or if the intent is ambiguous, please return the same snippet with the conflict."
