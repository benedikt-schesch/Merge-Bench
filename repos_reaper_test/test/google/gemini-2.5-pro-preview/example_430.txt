The conflict arises from the use of two different class names for what appears to be a sorted object adapter: `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` (in HEAD) and `SortedObjectAdapter` (in commit `308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5`).

Both branches intend to achieve the same logic:
1. Find an existing `ListRow` for a given category.
2. If found, retrieve its adapter and add a `video` object to it.
3. If not found, create a new adapter, add the `video` to it, create a new `HeaderItem` and `ListRow`, and add this new row to the main adapter `mAdapter`.

The core difference is the specific class used for the adapter:
- HEAD uses `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` for casting the existing adapter and for instantiating a new one.
- The other commit uses `SortedObjectAdapter` for both operations.

**Reasoning for Resolution:**

1.  **Consistency**: Each branch is internally consistent. The type it casts to is the same type it instantiates.
2.  **Class Nature**:
    *   `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` strongly suggests a concrete class implementation, likely extending `ArrayObjectAdapter` (a common Leanback class) and adding sorting capabilities.
    *   `SortedObjectAdapter` is more ambiguous. It could be an interface, an abstract class, or an older/alternative concrete class.
3.  **Instantiation**:
    *   `new SortedArrayObjectAdapter(...)` is valid if `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` is a concrete class.
    *   `new SortedObjectAdapter(...)` is valid if `SortedObjectAdapter` is a concrete class. If it's an interface or abstract class, this line would generally be an error unless it's part of a factory pattern not shown.
4.  **Plausible Scenario**: It's common for codebases to evolve.
    *   One class might have been renamed to another (e.g., `SortedObjectAdapter` renamed to `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` for clarity or specificity, or vice-versa).
    *   A more specific or optimized implementation (`SortedArrayObjectAdapter`) might have replaced an older or more generic one (`SortedObjectAdapter`).
    *   An interface (`SortedObjectAdapter`) might have been introduced, with `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` being a concrete implementation. However, if this were the case, the instantiation `new SortedObjectAdapter(...)` would typically be `new SortedArrayObjectAdapter(...)` or another concrete class, while variables and casts might use the interface type.

Given that `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` sounds like a specific, concrete implementation and is used consistently in HEAD for both casting and instantiation, it is a robust choice. If `SortedObjectAdapter` were an interface or abstract class, the instantiation `new SortedObjectAdapter(...)` in the other branch would be problematic.

Assuming `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` is the intended, current concrete class to be used in this part of the codebase (perhaps due to a prior refactoring or a deliberate choice for its features), the version from HEAD is preferred. This choice maintains the agreed-upon logic structure while using the class name that is presumed to be the current standard for this project.

The resolution will be to use `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` as specified in HEAD.

```java
                    ListRow row = findListRow(category);

                    // if found add this video
                    // if not, create a new row and add it
                    if (row != null) {
                        ((SortedArrayObjectAdapter) row.getAdapter()).add(video);
                    } else {
                        SortedArrayObjectAdapter listRowAdapter = new SortedArrayObjectAdapter(
                                videoNameComparator, mCardPresenter);
                        listRowAdapter.add(video);

                        HeaderItem header = new HeaderItem(0, category, null);
                        mAdapter.add(0, new ListRow(header, listRowAdapter));
