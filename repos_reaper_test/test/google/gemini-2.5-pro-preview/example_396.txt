The conflict arises from two different ways of initializing the `filterList` and the introduction of `testNGConfigurator` in one branch.

**HEAD's Intent:**
1.  Introduce a method `getFilterFile(environment)` to obtain the `File` object for filters.
2.  Initialize `filterList` using a `RegexFileFilter` with the `File` obtained from `getFilterFile()`.
3.  Introduce and initialize a `testNGConfigurator` also using the `File` from `getFilterFile()`.

**Branch `3df3b40acb25cbd0cde24cc0fc6f8be6c0fac9b4`'s Intent:**
1.  Construct the path to a filter file named "infinitest.filters" located in the environment's working directory.
2.  Initialize `filterList` using a `RegexFileFilter` with a `File` object created from this explicit path.

**Semantic Resolution:**
Both branches aim to initialize `filterList` based on a filter file. HEAD refactors the file retrieval into `getFilterFile()` and additionally introduces `testNGConfigurator` which uses the same filter file. Branch `3df3b40acb25cbd0cde24cc0fc6f8be6c0fac9b4` explicitly defines the filter file path.

Assuming `getFilterFile(environment)` is intended to correctly retrieve the standard filter file (likely "infinitest.filters" from the working directory, as hinted by the other branch), then HEAD's approach is a superset of functionality and a preferable design due to encapsulation. It centralizes the logic for obtaining the filter file and adds a new related component (`testNGConfigurator`).

The resolution is to adopt HEAD's changes, which includes the abstracted file retrieval and the new TestNG configurator.

```java
    {
        checkNotNull(environment, "No runtime environment is configured. Maybe because the project has no jdk.");

        runtimeEnvironment = environment;
        this.eventQueue = eventQueue;
        File filterFile = getFilterFile(environment);
        filterList = new RegexFileFilter(filterFile);
        testNGConfigurator = new TestNGConfigurator(filterFile);
        runnerClass = MultiProcessRunner.class;
        controller = new SingleLockConcurrencyController();
    }
