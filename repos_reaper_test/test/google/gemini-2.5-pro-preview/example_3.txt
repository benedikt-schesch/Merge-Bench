To resolve this merge conflict, we need to understand the intent of both changes:

1.  **The `HEAD` branch (ending in `...ServerConnection.java`)** changed the arguments to the `connect` method. It now seems to pass a server name string (`BungeeCord.instance.config.defaultServerName`) as the second argument, followed by the `ServerInfo` object (`def`). This suggests the `connect` method signature was refactored to `connect(UserConnection user, String serverName, ServerInfo serverInfo, DefinedPacket handshake, boolean retry)`.

2.  **The other branch (ending in `...ServerConnection.java`)** added a user-facing message before attempting to reconnect to the default server. It calls `connect` with the older signature `connect(UserConnection user, ServerInfo serverInfo, DefinedPacket handshake, boolean retry)`.

**Semantic Resolution:**

The goal is to connect the user to `def`, which is defined as the listener's default server:
`ServerInfo def = ProxyServer.getInstance().getServers().get(user.getPendingConnection().getListener().getDefaultServer());`

*   The user notification added by the second branch (`user.sendMessage(...)`) is a good user experience improvement and should be kept.
*   Assuming the `connect` method signature has indeed been updated as implied by `HEAD`, the call should conform to this new signature.
*   When connecting to the server represented by the `ServerInfo` object `def`, the most accurate server name to pass would be `def.getName()`.
    Using `BungeeCord.instance.config.defaultServerName` (as HEAD does) is only correct if this global default server name is guaranteed to be the same as the listener's default server name (`def.getName()`). If they can differ, passing `BungeeCord.instance.config.defaultServerName` along with `def` (which is the listener's default `ServerInfo`) could lead to inconsistencies or indicate connection to the listener's default server but logging/identifying it by the global default's name. Using `def.getName()` ensures the name passed matches the `ServerInfo` object.
*   It's assumed that `def` will not be null at this point, as `connect` methods typically expect a non-null `ServerInfo` or would fail. If `def` were null, `def.getName()` would cause a `NullPointerException`. Both original branches would have passed a null `def` to `connect`, which would likely fail inside `connect`.

**Combined Solution:**

We will incorporate the user message and adapt the `connect` call to use the presumed new signature, ensuring the server name provided matches the `ServerInfo` object (`def`).

```java
        } catch (Exception ex)
        {
            ServerInfo def = ProxyServer.getInstance().getServers().get(user.getPendingConnection().getListener().getDefaultServer());
            if (retry && !info.equals(def))
            {
                user.sendMessage(ChatColor.RED + "Could not connect to target server, you have been moved to the default server");
                return connect(user, def.getName(), def, handshake, false);
            } else
            {
                throw new RuntimeException("Could not connect to target server " + Util.exception(ex));
            }
        }
