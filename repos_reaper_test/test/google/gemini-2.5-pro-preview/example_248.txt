The merge conflict occurs in the indentation of a multi-line statement. Both sides of the conflict are semantically identical: they deserialize a configuration string `conf.get(PIG_INPUTS)` into an `ArrayList<FileSpec>`. The difference is purely stylistic, related to how continuation lines are indented.

- **HEAD** indents the first continuation line by 4 spaces relative to the initial line's indentation level, and the subsequent argument line by 8 spaces relative to the start of the first continuation line.
- **Commit `1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81`** indents the first continuation line by 8 spaces relative to the initial line's indentation level, and the subsequent argument line also by 8 spaces relative to the start of the first continuation line.

Both styles are common. The style from commit `1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81` uses a consistent 8-space increment for nested continuations/arguments, which aligns well with some style guides (e.g., Google Java Style's "+8 rule" for continuation lines) and can sometimes offer more horizontal space for the content of the continued lines. Given this consistency, this version is chosen for the merge.
