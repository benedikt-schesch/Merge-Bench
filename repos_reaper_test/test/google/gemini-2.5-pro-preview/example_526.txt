The conflict arises from an `else if` block introduced in `HEAD` that has the exact same condition as the preceding `if` block: `maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength`.

**Analysis of Intent:**

*   **The `if` block (common context before the conflict):**
    ```java
                            if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength){
                                if (verbose){
                                    System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                                }
                                builder.append(url);
    ```
    This block handles the case where the `uriString` length exceeds `maxUriLength`. It logs a warning mentioning "bytes" and appends the original URL.

*   **`HEAD` branch:**
    ```java
                            } else if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength){ // Identical condition
                                if (verbose){
                                    System.err.println("[INFO] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI longer than " + maxUriLength + " characters. Skipping.");
                                }
                                builder.append(url);
    ```
    `HEAD` adds an `else if` block. Critically, its condition is identical to the `if` block immediately preceding it. This means this `else if` block is unreachable:
    *   If the first `if` condition is true, its body executes, and the `else if` is skipped.
    *   If the first `if` condition is false, then the condition in the `else if` (being identical) will also be false, and its body is also skipped.
    The intent seems to be to log a different message ([INFO] instead of [WARNING], "characters" instead of "bytes") for the same condition, but its placement as an `else if` with an identical condition makes it dead code.

*   **`cbc12a863399869d00e8dade047061bc441e7456` branch (the `======= ... >>>>>>>` part):**
    This branch has no code in the conflicting section, meaning it effectively removes or did not add the `else if` block that `HEAD` introduced.

**Resolution:**

The `else if` block introduced by `HEAD` is redundant and unreachable due to its condition being identical to the preceding `if` statement's condition. The most logical semantic resolution is to remove this unreachable code. This aligns with the state of the `cbc12a863399869d00e8dade047061bc441e7456` branch for this specific conflicting part (i.e., having no code there).

If the intent of `HEAD` was to change the logging message for the condition, the original `if` block should have been modified directly, rather than adding an unreachable `else if` block. Resolving the current conflict involves choosing between `HEAD`'s addition and the other branch's omission of that addition. Given the logical flaw in `HEAD`'s addition, omitting it is the correct path.

The resolved code will therefore exclude the `else if` block from `HEAD`.

```java
                        if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength){
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                            }      
                            builder.append(url);
                        } else {

                            /*
                             * Determine what to do. Eventually, you should be able to
                             * have both a data URI and MHTML in the same file.
