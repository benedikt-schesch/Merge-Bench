To resolve this merge conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes from both `HEAD` and the other branch (`ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66`).

**HEAD's Intent:**
The `HEAD` revision introduces a local variable `sMediaPlayer` by fetching it from `mMediaPlayers` using `mPreparedQuery`. It then performs a null check on this newly fetched `sMediaPlayer`.
```java
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null)
```

**Other Branch's (`ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66`) Intent:**
This branch modifies an existing `if` statement that checks `sMediaPlayer`. The change is primarily stylistic: adding an opening curly brace `{` to the `if` statement, which is good practice for defining a clear block structure. It assumes `sMediaPlayer` is already defined in its scope.
```java
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
```

**Semantic Resolution:**
1.  The line `MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);` from `HEAD` is crucial. Without it, `sMediaPlayer` in the `if` condition would be an undefined variable (unless it were a class field, but the local assignment in `HEAD` suggests it's intended to be fetched specifically here). The use of `mPreparedQuery` further implies that the `MediaPlayer` instance is specific to this query and should be fetched locally.
2.  Both branches agree on the condition `if (sMediaPlayer != null)`.
3.  The change from branch `ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66` to add the opening curly brace `{` is a beneficial stylistic improvement that enhances code readability and robustness.

Therefore, the resolution should combine these intents:
*   Include the local variable declaration and initialization from `HEAD`.
*   Use the `if` condition common to both.
*   Include the opening curly brace `{` from the other branch.

This results in the following lines:
```java
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
```
This merged code retrieves the specific `MediaPlayer` instance and then checks if it's non-null using a clear block structure, ensuring both semantic correctness and good coding style.

```java
        }
    }

    @Override
    public long getPosition() {
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            return sMediaPlayer.getCurrentPosition();
        }
        return 0;
    }
