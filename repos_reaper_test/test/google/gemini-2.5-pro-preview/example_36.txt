To resolve the merge conflict, we need to consider the intent of both changes and how they interact with the surrounding code.

The method immediately preceding the conflict is:
```java
    public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, String commandName, CommandMetadata command, StringBuilder out)
    {
        usage(programName, groupName, commandName, command, new UsagePrinter(out, columnSize));
    }
```
This method takes a `commandName` string and a `StringBuilder out`. It then calls another `usage` method, passing along `programName`, `groupName`, `commandName`, `command`, and a newly created `UsagePrinter`.

Now let's look at the conflicting versions for the called method:

**HEAD version:**
```java
    public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, CommandMetadata command, UsagePrinter out) {
```
This version of the `usage` method (the one taking a `UsagePrinter`) *does not* include the `commandName` parameter. If this version is chosen, the call `usage(programName, groupName, commandName, command, new UsagePrinter(out, columnSize));` from the method above would result in a compile-time error due to a signature mismatch (too many arguments, specifically `commandName` would be unexpected).

**Incoming change (a647950590fa...) version:**
```java
    public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, String commandName, CommandMetadata command, UsagePrinter out)
    {
```
This version of the `usage` method *does* include the `commandName` parameter. This signature is compatible with the call `usage(programName, groupName, commandName, command, new UsagePrinter(out, columnSize));` from the method above.

**Semantic Analysis:**
The primary purpose of the first `usage` method (taking `StringBuilder`) seems to be to prepare arguments (including creating a `UsagePrinter`) and then delegate to the second `usage` method (taking `UsagePrinter`). The explicit passing of `commandName` from the first method to the second implies that this `commandName` is intended to be used by the second method.

Choosing the HEAD version would break this delegation chain unless the calling site (the first `usage` method) was also changed to stop passing `commandName`. Since that change is not part of this conflict, accepting HEAD would lead to an inconsistent state.

Choosing the incoming change (a647950590fa...) maintains the integrity of the call chain. The `commandName` passed to the first `usage` method is successfully relayed to the second `usage` method. This version also matches the brace style (`{` on a new line) of the surrounding code.

Therefore, the incoming change (a647950590fa...) is the semantically correct resolution as it preserves the existing parameter flow and calling convention between the overloaded `usage` methods.

```java
    public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, String commandName, CommandMetadata command, StringBuilder out)
    {
        usage(programName, groupName, commandName, command, new UsagePrinter(out, columnSize));
    }

    public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, String commandName, CommandMetadata command, UsagePrinter out)
    {
        //
        // NAME
        //
        out.append("NAME").newline();
