Okay, I will analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict to resolve it.

The conflict is:
```diff
        return openDFSFile(fileName, ConfigurationUtil.toProperties(wrapper.getJobConf()));
<<<<<<< HEAD
        
=======

>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }
```

Let's break down what each side is trying to do:
*   **HEAD**: This side introduces a single line containing 8 spaces followed by a newline. This results in one visually blank line between the `return` statement and the closing curly brace `}` of the method.
*   **1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309**: This side introduces two lines, each containing 8 spaces followed by a newline. This results in two visually blank lines between the `return` statement and the closing curly brace `}`.

**Intent Analysis:**
Both sides intend to add vertical whitespace after the last statement in the method and before its closing brace. This is a common practice for improving code readability by visually separating the method's body from its end. The difference lies purely in the amount of whitespace: one blank line versus two blank lines.

**Semantic Analysis:**
The change is purely stylistic and has no impact on the program's logic or runtime behavior. Adding one or two blank lines does not change the compiled bytecode.

**Resolution:**
In Java, it's common to use a single blank line to separate logical blocks of code or to improve readability. While two blank lines are not incorrect, one blank line is generally more conventional in this specific context (i.e., just before a closing curly brace of a method). Adding excessive blank lines can sometimes be discouraged by style guides or linters.

Given that the intent is simply to add visual separation, one blank line (as in HEAD) sufficiently achieves this goal and aligns with common Java formatting practices. Therefore, HEAD's version is preferred as the more standard and slightly cleaner approach.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict resolved by choosing HEAD's change:

```java
        if (wrapper == null)
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "can't open DFS file while executing locally");
        
        return openDFSFile(fileName, ConfigurationUtil.toProperties(wrapper.getJobConf()));
        
    }

    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName, Properties properties) throws IOException{
        DataStorage dds = new HDataStorage(properties);
        ElementDescriptor elem = dds.asElement(fileName);

```
