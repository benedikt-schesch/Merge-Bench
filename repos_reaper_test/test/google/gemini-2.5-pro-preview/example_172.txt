Okay, I will analyze the intents and propose a semantic resolution.

**Understanding the Conflict:**

The conflict appears in two parts:

1.  **Inside the `if (!globMatchesFiles(...))` block:**
    *   `HEAD` has no changes within the `if` block if the glob *does* match (i.e., `!globMatchesFiles` is false). It would simply fall through.
    *   `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` (let's call it "Branch B") adds an `else` clause. If the glob *does* match files (i.e., `!globMatchesFiles` is false, so the `else` is taken), it explicitly calls `getFileElementDescriptors(elem)` to populate `elements` and then immediately returns `new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements)`.

2.  **The final `return` statement:**
    *   The line `return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);` is followed by `<<<<<<< HEAD` and then an empty line. This typically means that `HEAD`'s version includes this return statement and the subsequent empty line.
    *   Branch B's changes (from the first part of the conflict) end before this, implying that Branch B effectively removed this final return statement (or it was part of a larger change where this line was not present in its version of this section).

**Analyzing Intents:**

*   **Branch B's Intent (Glob Handling):** Branch B aims to make glob handling more explicit. If an element is determined to be a glob and it successfully matches files, Branch B wants to:
    1.  Resolve the glob into a list of actual file descriptors using `getFileElementDescriptors(elem)`.
    2.  Immediately create and return an iterator for these resolved files.
    This is a more robust way to handle globs than potentially relying on `elements` being pre-configured or the iterator itself understanding glob patterns.

*   **Branch B's Intent (Final Return):** By returning early from the glob-matching case and (implicitly) removing the final `return` statement, Branch B might be moving towards a model where every successful path explicitly returns, rather than falling through to a common return. However, this snippet doesn't show how other paths (e.g., if `elem` was a directory or a single existing file, handled before this `else` block) are treated by Branch B. If those paths still relied on the common final `return`, its removal by Branch B would be an issue.

*   **HEAD's Intent (Glob Handling):** HEAD's logic doesn't have special handling *within this `if` block* if a glob matches. It would fall through to the common `return` statement. This implies that either `elements` was already correctly populated to handle the glob scenario before this `else` block, or the `DataStorageInputStreamIterator` is expected to handle an `elem` that is a glob pattern.

*   **HEAD's Intent (Final Return):** HEAD intends to keep the common `return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);` statement. This statement is crucial for code paths that set up `elements` correctly (e.g., for directories or single files) and then expect to use this common point to create the iterator.

**Semantic Resolution:**

1.  **Glob Handling:** Branch B's explicit handling of glob matching (`else { elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); return ...; }`) is semantically clearer and more robust. It ensures that if a glob matches, the `elements` list contains the resolved files, not the glob pattern itself. This is generally preferable.

2.  **Final Return Statement:**
    *   If Branch B's glob-handling logic (which includes an early `return`) is adopted, that specific path will no longer reach the final `return`.
    *   However, other paths (e.g., `elem` being a directory or a pre-existing single file, presumably handled *before* the `else { // It might be a glob ... }` block shown in the snippet) would still rely on this final `return` statement.
    *   Removing the final `return` (as Branch B seems to imply) is only safe if all other paths leading to iterator creation have also been updated to return early. This cannot be confirmed from the snippet alone.
    *   Therefore, the safest approach is to adopt Branch B's improved glob handling *and* keep HEAD's final `return` statement, as it serves other necessary code paths.

**Resolved Code:**

The resolution will incorporate Branch B's `else` block for when a glob matches, and retain HEAD's final `return` statement for other cases.

        } else {
            // It might be a glob
            if (!globMatchesFiles(elem, elem.getDataStorage())) {
                throw new IOException(elem.toString() + " does not exist");
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem);
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);

            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
