The conflict presented is purely stylistic, affecting how a single Java statement is formatted across multiple lines. Both sides of the conflict achieve the exact same semantic result: retrieving the `ApplicationPath` annotation from the `application` object's class.

*   **HEAD** chose to break the line after `application.getClass()`, placing the chained method call `.getAnnotation(ApplicationPath.class)` on the next line. This is a common style for fluent APIs or chained method calls.
*   **1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f** chose to break the line after `application.getClass().getAnnotation(`, placing the argument `ApplicationPath.class` on the next line. This is a common style for formatting method arguments when the line is long or there are multiple arguments.

Both formatting choices are valid and widely used. In the absence of a specific project style guide dictating one over the other, either could be chosen. The `HEAD` version arguably emphasizes the chained nature of the calls (`getClass()` followed by `getAnnotation()`) slightly more, which is a common pattern. We will resolve by choosing the `HEAD` version.

```java
                .setUseSectionNamingPackageStrategy(useSectionNamingPackageStrategy);

        if (baseRef != null) {
            collectInfo.setApplicationPath(baseRef.getPath());
        } else if (application != null) {
            ApplicationPath applicationPath = application.getClass()
                    .getAnnotation(ApplicationPath.class);
            if (applicationPath != null) {
                collectInfo.setApplicationPath(applicationPath.value());
            }
        }
