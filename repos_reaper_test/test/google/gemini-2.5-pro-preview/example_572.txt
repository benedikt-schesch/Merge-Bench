The conflict arises from two different ways of checking if a field should be skipped during JSON deserialization:

1.  **HEAD (`jsonObject.get(facebookFieldName) == null`)**: This condition would be true if the `facebookFieldName` is not present in the `jsonObject` (assuming `get` returns `null` for missing keys) OR if the field is_present_ but its value is explicitly `null` in the JSON (e.g., `"fieldName": null`).

2.  **Incoming (`!jsonObject.has(facebookFieldName)`)**: This condition is true *only* if the `facebookFieldName` is not present in the `jsonObject`. If the field is present, even with an explicit `null` value, this condition would be false, and the code would not skip.

The subsequent log message states: "No JSON value present for '%s', skipping."
This message aligns more closely with the intent of the incoming change (`!jsonObject.has(facebookFieldName)`). If a field is explicitly `null` (e.g., `{"fieldName": null}`), then a JSON value *is* present (that value being `null`). The `!jsonObject.has()` check accurately reflects the situation where the *key itself* is not present.

Semantically, in many JSON deserialization scenarios, it's desirable to differentiate between a field that is entirely absent and a field that is present with an explicit `null` value. The incoming change (`!jsonObject.has()`) allows for this distinction:
*   If the field is absent, it's skipped.
*   If the field is present with a `null` value, it's *not* skipped by this check, allowing subsequent logic to potentially map this explicit `null` to the Java object's field.

This behavior is generally more robust and aligns with the principle of least surprise for users providing JSON input. An explicit `null` usually signifies an intent to clear or nullify a field, which is different from omitting the field altogether.

Therefore, the incoming change (`!jsonObject.has(facebookFieldName)`) is preferred as it provides a more precise condition for skipping based on the actual absence of the field key, and better supports the distinction between a missing field and an explicitly nulled field.

```java
      // For each Facebook-annotated field on the current Java object, pull data
      // out of the JSON object and put it in the Java object
      for (FieldWithAnnotation<Facebook> fieldWithAnnotation : fieldsWithAnnotation) {
        String facebookFieldName = getFacebookFieldName(fieldWithAnnotation);

        if (!jsonObject.has(facebookFieldName)) {
          if (MAPPER_LOGGER.isTraceEnabled()) {
            MAPPER_LOGGER
              .trace(format("No JSON value present for '%s', skipping. JSON is '%s'.", facebookFieldName, json));
          }
