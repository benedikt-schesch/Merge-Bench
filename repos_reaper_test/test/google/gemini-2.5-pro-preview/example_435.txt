Okay, I will analyze the conflict and provide the resolution if the intent is clear, otherwise, I'll return the conflict.

The conflict is:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private SharedPreferences mSharedPreferences;
=======
>>>>>>> 308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5
```

Here's the breakdown of intents:
*   **HEAD**: This side of the merge includes the line `private SharedPreferences mSharedPreferences;`. The intent is to have a member variable of type `SharedPreferences` named `mSharedPreferences` in the class. This could be for storing preferences, session data, or other configuration.
*   **308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5**: This side of the mergeresults in this line being absent. This could mean:
    1.  This line never existed on this branch, and HEAD added it.
    2.  This line existed in the common ancestor, and this branch (308db...) intentionally removed it (e.g., as part of a refactor where `SharedPreferences` are no longer used by this class or are accessed differently).

**Semantic Analysis:**

*   If HEAD added `mSharedPreferences` for new functionality, and branch `308db...` simply doesn't have this new functionality, then keeping HEAD's version (adding the line) is appropriate to include the new feature.
*   If `mSharedPreferences` was present in the common ancestor of both branches, HEAD kept it (or made no changes to it), and branch `308db...` removed it (e.g., because it's deprecated or refactored), then the intent of `308db...` is to remove this field. In this case, a decision needs to be made whether the removal is the correct path forward or if HEAD still requires this field for reasons not yet incorporated from `308db...`'s EOL plan for this field.

Without additional context (e.g., commit messages, related changes in other parts of the code for both branches), it's difficult to definitively determine whether the addition in HEAD is a new, desired feature or if the absence in `308db...` is a deliberate removal that HEAD should adopt. Both scenarios are plausible.

Since the intent is ambiguous without more information about the history of this line and the changes in both branches, I will return the snippet with the conflict markers intact, as per the instructions. A developer with deeper knowledge of the project's evolution and the specific changes in these branches would be needed to make the correct resolution.

```java
    private Timer mBackgroundTimer;
    private String mBackgroundImageUrl;
    private ArrayObjectAdapter mAdapter;
    private CardPresenter mCardPresenter;
    private TvShowsCardPresenter mTvShowsCardPresenter;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private SharedPreferences mSharedPreferences;
=======
>>>>>>> 308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5

    private BroadcastReceiver videoUpdateReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
        @Override
        public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
            Bundle bundle = intent.getExtras();
