Given the information, it's ambiguous whether the import `br.com.caelum.iogi.Instantiator` is necessary in the merged code.
The `HEAD` version includes this import, suggesting that changes in `HEAD` require this class.
The `0b417b6a09b0560e1dbb221d37310d67f7f56fcb` version does not include this import, suggesting that either the class was not used or its usage was removed in that line of development.

Without seeing the rest of the code in the file to determine if `br.com.caelum.iogi.Instantiator` is actually used after the merge, the safest approach according to the instructions is to return the conflict unresolved. A developer with full context of the changes in both branches would need to determine if the import is required.
