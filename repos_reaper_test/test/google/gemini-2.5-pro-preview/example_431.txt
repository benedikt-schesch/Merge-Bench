Both `refreshSubCategories` and `rebuildSubCategories` aim to update the subcategories based on a list of all videos, sorted by creation date.

The core of the operation starts with `Video.listAll(Video.class)`, which fetches the entire set of videos. This suggests that the subcategories are (or will be) based on a complete, fresh dataset, not an incremental update to existing data.

- `refreshSubCategories`: This term is commonly used for UI updates. It generally implies making the UI reflect the latest data. It's broad and could cover various strategies (full reload, incremental update, etc.).
- `rebuildSubCategories`: This term suggests a more explicit reconstruction. Given that all video data is fetched anew, if the subcategory representation (be it data structures or UI elements) is cleared and then repopulated from this complete list, `rebuild` accurately describes this "from scratch" process.

Considering `Video.listAll(Video.class)` provides a complete dataset, `rebuildSubCategories` seems to more precisely convey the semantics of constructing the subcategories based on this comprehensive, newly-fetched data. It implies that any previous state of subcategories is likely discarded and they are built anew. While `refresh` is not incorrect (as refreshing often involves a full data reload), `rebuild` offers a bit more specificity about the "from-scratch" nature stemming from the full data fetch.

Therefore, `rebuildSubCategories` is chosen as it aligns slightly better with the apparent action of creating the subcategory list from a complete dataset.

```java
                mAdapter.add(0, new ListRow(header, listRowAdapter));
            }
        }
    }

    private void rebuildSubCategories() {
        List<Video> videos = Video.listAll(Video.class);
        Collections.sort(videos, new Comparator<Video>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Video o1, Video o2) {
                return Long.valueOf(o2.getCreated()).compareTo(o1.getCreated());

```
