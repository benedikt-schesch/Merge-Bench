Here's the code snippet with the merge conflict resolved where possible, and unresolved parts left as is, preserving context and spacing:

```java
                            @Override
                            public void onFinished(Void result) {
                                UiThread.getInstance().post(new Runnable() {
                                    @Override
                                    public void run() {
                                        Logger.log(SmsSentReceiver.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed message deleted ");
                                        App.bus.post(new ReloadMessagesEvent());
                                    }
                                });
                            }
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
**Reasoning for the resolution:**

1.  **First Conflict (inside `run()` method):**
    *   `<<<<<<< HEAD` showed: `Logger.log(SmsSentReceiver.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed message deleted ");`
    *   `>>>>>>> 2d52502932f7e7875f4269e8198e522945bcf696` showed an empty line (no code).
    *   Both branches subsequently included: `App.bus.post(new ReloadMessagesEvent());`

    **Semantic Intent:**
    *   **HEAD:** Intends to log that a "Failed message deleted" event occurred before reloading messages. This adds diagnostic information.
    *   **2d52502932f7e7875f4269e8198e522945bcf696:** Intends to reload messages without the preceding log statement.

    **Resolution:** Logging is generally a non-disruptive and informative addition. The intent of HEAD to log this specific event appears beneficial for debugging or monitoring. Since it doesn't conflict with the core functionality of posting the `ReloadMessagesEvent`, and enhances understanding of the program flow, the logging statement from HEAD is included.

2.  **Second Conflict (after `onFinished` method):**
    *   The snippet ends with `<<<<<<< HEAD` followed by a newline.
    *   This conflict marker is incomplete; it lacks the `=======` and `>>>>>>> other_branch_ref` parts that would show the content from the other branch and delimit the conflict.

    **Semantic Intent:**
    *   The intent for this part of the code is ambiguous due to the incomplete conflict marker. We can see what HEAD introduced (or kept), which seems to be a newline in this truncated snippet, but we cannot see what the other branch intended for this location.

    **Resolution:** Due to the ambiguity and lack of complete information for this conflict, it is returned unresolved, as per the instruction: "If you are not sure on how to resolve the conflict or if the intent is ambiguous, please return the same snippet with the conflict."

The resulting code incorporates the logging from HEAD in the first conflict and leaves the second, incomplete conflict marker as it was in the provided snippet.
