To resolve the merge conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes on both sides.

**Left Side (HEAD):**
1.  Test method signature: `void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun() throws CoreException`
    *   The method visibility is package-private (no explicit modifier). In JUnit 5, test methods are no longer required to be `public`. This change might be an intentional update to modern JUnit 5 conventions.
2.  Method call: `InfinitestCore core = prepateCore(projectAUri(), 0);`
    *   There is a typo: `prepateCore` instead of `prepareCore`. This is likely an unintentional error.

**Right Side (ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586):**
1.  Test method signature: `public void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun() throws CoreException`
    *   The method visibility is `public`. This is the traditional visibility for JUnit tests and is still widely used.
2.  Method call: `InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 0);`
    *   The method name `prepareCore` is correctly spelled.

**Semantic Resolution:**

The primary goal is to have a correctly functioning test.
1.  **Method Name Typo:** The typo `prepateCore` in HEAD is an error. The correct method name is `prepareCore` as seen in the right side. This part of the resolution is straightforward: use `prepareCore`.
2.  **Test Method Visibility:**
    *   HEAD's intent seems to be to use package-private visibility for test methods, which is a valid and common practice in JUnit 5.
    *   The right side's intent is to use `public` visibility, which is also valid.

To combine these intents semantically:
*   We must fix the typo by using `prepareCore`.
*   For the visibility, if we assume the change to package-private (HEAD) was a deliberate stylistic modernization and the typo was an accident, while the right side focused on fixing the typo (and perhaps maintained an older visibility style), a good semantic merge would combine the stylistic update from HEAD with the typo fix from the right side.

Therefore, the resolved code would use package-private visibility (`void`) for the test method and the corrected method name (`prepareCore`).

```java
		when(coreRegistry.getCore(projectAUri)).thenReturn(core);
		return core;
	}

	@Test
	void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun() throws CoreException {
		InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 0);

		workspace.updateProjects(Collections.singleton(resource));

		assertStatusIs(noTestsRun());
		verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));

```
