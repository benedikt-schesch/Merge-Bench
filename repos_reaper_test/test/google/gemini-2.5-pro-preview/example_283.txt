The conflict shows two different implementations for the end of this method:
1.  **HEAD**: This version retrieves a `Result` object from `pkgr.getNext()`, extracts a `Tuple` from it, processes this `Tuple` with `illustratorMarkup()`, and then returns the original `Result` object. The intent is to apply markup to the tuple. For this to be effective, `illustratorMarkup` must modify the `Tuple` object in-place, or the `Result` object `r` must somehow be aware of the (potentially new) `packedTup` after the `illustratorMarkup` call. Assuming the author of HEAD intended the markup to be effective, this implies `illustratorMarkup` modifies the tuple instance that `r.result` refers to.
2.  **88ae4a5...**: This version simply calls `pkgr.getNext()` and returns its result directly. The intent is to return the packager's result without any additional processing in this step.

**Semantic Analysis**:
The HEAD branch introduces a new processing step (`illustratorMarkup`). The other branch (`88ae4a5...`) presents a simpler, direct return.
Typically, in merge conflicts of this nature:
*   If HEAD is a feature branch being merged into a main/development branch (which `88ae4a5...` might represent or be an ancestor of), the intent is to incorporate the new feature (the markup processing).
*   If `88ae4a5...` represents a deliberate removal or simplification of previously existing markup logic, and HEAD attempts to modify that (now-removed) logic, it would be a more complex conflict.

Given the structure, it's most likely that the code in `88ae4a5...` (i.e., `return pkgr.getNext();`) was the original behavior, and HEAD introduced the `illustratorMarkup` call and the associated logic to handle the `Result` and `Tuple` objects. The new lines in HEAD (`Result r = ...`, `Tuple packedTup = ...`, `packedTup = illustratorMarkup(...)`) support this interpretation.

**Resolution**:
The most common and forward-progressing resolution is to assume that the changes in HEAD are desired additions of functionality. The introduction of `illustratorMarkup` appears to be an intentional enhancement. Therefore, the version from HEAD will be chosen. Any potential issues regarding whether `illustratorMarkup` effectively modifies the `Tuple` within the returned `Result` object are considered implementation details or potential bugs within HEAD's logic, rather than a conflict of merge intent. The intent to apply markup is clear from HEAD.

```java
            // and return it.
            pkgr.attachInput(key, dbs, readOnce);
            detachInput();
        }

        Result r = pkgr.getNext();
        Tuple packedTup = (Tuple) r.result;
        packedTup = illustratorMarkup(null, packedTup, 0);
        return r;
    }

    public Packager getPkgr() {
        return pkgr;
    }
