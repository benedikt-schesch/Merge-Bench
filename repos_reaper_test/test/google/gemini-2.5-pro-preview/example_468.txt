The conflict arises from two different ways of setting a principal on a `result` object after deserializing it.

**HEAD branch:**
`result.setPrincipal( deserializePrincipal( principalData, manager ) );`
This version calls `result.setPrincipal(...)` and uses a `manager` object as context for the `deserializePrincipal` method.

**Branch `6c5fb5474dc66d5ab104a5546f43f05b75a4aaa2`:**
`result.setPrincipalInternal( deserializePrincipal( principalData, realm ) );`
This version calls `result.setPrincipalInternal(...)` and uses a `realm` object as context for the `deserializePrincipal` method.

**Semantic Analysis:**

1.  **Deserialization Context (`manager` vs. `realm`):**
    *   The `deserializePrincipal` method takes a second argument for context.
    *   A `realm` is a common concept in security frameworks, often representing a data source or authority for users, groups, and roles (i.e., principals).
    *   A `manager` is a more generic term.
    *   The change from `manager` to `realm` suggests a move towards a more domain-specific and conventional way of handling security principals. It's likely that the `realm` object provides more appropriate or necessary information for deserializing the principal. This indicates that `deserializePrincipal(principalData, realm)` is likely the intended modern call for deserialization.

2.  **Setter Method (`setPrincipal` vs. `setPrincipalInternal`):**
    *   The method name on the `result` object also differs. `setPrincipalInternal` suggests it might be a method intended for use within the same package or class, potentially bypassing some higher-level logic or checks that a public `setPrincipal` might perform, or it could be part of a refactoring where the previous `setPrincipal`'s functionality was changed or moved.
    *   If the way principals are deserialized changed (i.e., now using `realm`), it's plausible that the method to set this principal on the `result` object also adapted, leading to the use or introduction of `setPrincipalInternal`.

**Resolution Rationale:**
The changes in branch `6c5fb5474dc66d5ab104a5546f43f05b75a4aaa2` (using `realm` for deserialization context and `setPrincipalInternal` for setting the principal) appear to be a cohesive set of changes. It's common for refactoring in security-related code to involve more specific context objects (like `realm`) and adjustments to how these objects are set or managed (potentially via "internal" methods if the public API has evolved).

Assuming that the `realm` provides a more correct or updated context for deserializing principals, and `setPrincipalInternal` is the corresponding method to set such a principal on the `result` object (perhaps due to a refactoring or change in API design), then the version from branch `6c5fb5474dc66d5ab104a5546f43f05b75a4aaa2` represents the more likely intended state. This resolution presumes that these two changes (context object and setter method) are related and were made together to improve or update the principal handling mechanism.

```java
        final int currentIdx = 44 + idLength + 2;
        final short principalDataLength = (short) decodeNum( data, currentIdx, 2 );
        if ( principalDataLength > 0 ) {
            final byte[] principalData = new byte[principalDataLength];
            System.arraycopy( data, currentIdx + 2, principalData, 0, principalDataLength );
            result.setPrincipalInternal( deserializePrincipal( principalData, realm ) );
        }

        final byte[] attributesData = new byte[ data.length - sessionFieldsDataLength ];
        System.arraycopy( data, sessionFieldsDataLength, attributesData, 0, data.length - sessionFieldsDataLength );
