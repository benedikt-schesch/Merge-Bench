To resolve the merge conflict, we need to understand the intentions of both branches:

*   **HEAD branch:** This branch configures `nsre_low_watermark` and `nsre_high_watermark` by reading them as `int` values from the configuration.
    ```java
    nsre_low_watermark = config.getInt("hbase.nsre.low_watermark");
    nsre_high_watermark = config.getInt("hbase.nsre.high_watermark");
    ```

*   **Branch `003c60654636b9b3dc2f3a0846a8a76a44f1fb06`:** This branch makes two changes in this section:
    1.  It configures `nsre_low_watermark` and `nsre_high_watermark` by reading them as `short` values.
    2.  It introduces a new boolean configuration `hbase.increments.durable` and reads it into `increment_buffer_durable`, only if the property key exists.
    ```java
    nsre_low_watermark = config.getShort("hbase.nsre.low_watermark");
    nsre_high_watermark = config.getShort("hbase.nsre.high_watermark");
    if (config.properties.containsKey("hbase.increments.durable")) {
      increment_buffer_durable = config.getBoolean("hbase.increments.durable");
    }
    ```

**Semantic Analysis and Resolution:**

1.  **New Configuration (`increment_buffer_durable`):** The introduction of the `hbase.increments.durable` configuration by branch `003c60654636b9b3dc2f3a0846a8a76a44f1fb06` is a new feature. This change is independent of the watermark configuration types and should be included.

2.  **Watermark Configuration Type (`getInt` vs. `getShort`):**
    *   HEAD uses `config.getInt()`, allowing for a wider range of values for the watermarks.
    *   Branch `003c60654636b9b3dc2f3a0846a8a76a44f1fb06` uses `config.getShort()`, which restricts the values to the range of a `short` (-32,768 to 32,767).
    *   The choice between `int` and `short` depends on the expected range of values for these "NSRE watermarks". Using `getShort` might be an optimization or a correction if the values are known to be small. Other configurations in the vicinity use both `getInt` (e.g., `hbase.rpc.timeout`) and `getShort` (e.g., `hbase.rpcs.buffered_flush_interval`), indicating that the type is chosen deliberately per configuration.
    *   Assuming that branch `003c60654636b9b3dc2f3a0846a8a76a44f1fb06` represents a more recent or specific set of changes (e.g., a feature branch being merged), its modifications, including the type change to `short` for the watermarks, are likely intentional. This could be to more accurately reflect the nature of these specific watermarks or for consistency with other similar configurations not visible in this snippet.

**Combined Resolution:**
The most semantically sound resolution is to incorporate all changes from branch `003c60654636b9b3dc2f3a0846a8a76a44f1fb06` into this section. This means using `config.getShort()` for the watermarks and adding the new `increment_buffer_durable` configuration. This resolution presumes that the change to `short` is a deliberate refinement or correction.

```java
    rpc_timeout = config.getInt("hbase.rpc.timeout");
    timer = newTimer(config, "HBaseClient");
    rpc_timeout_timer = newTimer(config, "RPC Timeout Timer");
    flush_interval = config.getShort("hbase.rpcs.buffered_flush_interval");
    increment_buffer_size = config.getInt("hbase.increments.buffer_size");
    nsre_low_watermark = config.getShort("hbase.nsre.low_watermark");
    nsre_high_watermark = config.getShort("hbase.nsre.high_watermark");
    if (config.properties.containsKey("hbase.increments.durable")) {
      increment_buffer_durable = config.getBoolean("hbase.increments.durable");
    }
  }
