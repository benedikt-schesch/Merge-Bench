To resolve the merge conflict, I will analyze the intents of both branches:

**Intent of `HEAD` branch:**
1.  The `measureUser` method has the signature: `(TestUser user, ResultList recs, Context context)`.
2.  When selecting "good" items, it calls `goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, context.recommender, user)`. This implies that the selection of good items is dependent on or filtered by the `context.recommender`.

**Intent of `ae1b395ec63b1333c717fdac150e0860cf0326e0` branch (the incoming branch):**
1.  The `measureUser` method has an updated signature: `(TestUser user, int targetLength, ResultList recs, Context context)`. This introduces a new `targetLength` parameter, likely to control or specify the length of recommendations to consider for the measurement.
2.  When selecting "good" items, it calls `goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, user)`. This implies a choice to select good items based only on the `context.universe` (e.g., all test data for the user) and the `user`, without involving the `context.recommender`. This could be an intentional change to ensure the ground truth ("good items") is independent of the recommender being evaluated.

**Resolution Strategy:**
The goal is to combine these intents a_semantically_ meaningful way:
1.  **Method Signature:** The addition of the `int targetLength` parameter by branch `ae1b395...` appears to be a new feature or an enhancement to the `measureUser` method. This is generally a change to incorporate.
2.  **`goodItems.selectItems` call:** This is where the core semantic difference lies.
    *   `HEAD` uses `context.recommender`.
    *   `ae1b395...` does not use `context.recommender`.

    If branch `ae1b395...` is being merged into `HEAD`, we typically want to incorporate its new features (`targetLength`) while ensuring compatibility with the potentially evolved API usage in `HEAD`. The `HEAD` branch's call to `selectItems` using `context.recommender` might reflect an updated or preferred way of calling this utility method in the main development line, perhaps because the `goodItems.selectItems` API itself has evolved in `HEAD` to use (or require) the recommender for more accurate or context-aware item selection.

    Choosing `HEAD`'s way of calling `goodItems.selectItems` ensures that `measureUser` uses `goodItems` in a manner consistent with how it might be used elsewhere in `HEAD` or how the `goodItems` API is defined in `HEAD`. It assumes that the inclusion of `context.recommender` is intentional and beneficial in `HEAD`.

    Therefore, the resolution will be:
    *   Adopt the method signature from `ae1b395...` to include `targetLength`.
    *   Adopt the `goodItems.selectItems` call from `HEAD` which includes `context.recommender`.

This approach integrates the new functionality (`targetLength`) from the incoming branch while respecting the existing calling conventions or API preferences of the target branch (`HEAD`) for the `selectItems` utility.

```java
        return new AggregateResult(context).withSuffix(suffix);
    }

    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public MetricResult measureUser(TestUser user, int targetLength, ResultList recs, Context context) {
        LongSet good = goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, context.recommender, user);
        if (good.isEmpty()) {
            logger.warn("no good items for user {}", user.getUserId());
            return new UserResult(0, false);
        }
