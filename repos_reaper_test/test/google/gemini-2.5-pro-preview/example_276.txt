The conflict involves a differing number of empty lines and some leading whitespace on an empty line in one of the versions.

- `HEAD` intends to have one empty line after the statement `int total = current - initial;`.
- The branch `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a` (let's call it 'OTHER') intends to have two empty lines after the same statement. The first of these empty lines in OTHER's version also contains leading whitespace (`        `).

Both branches aim to add vertical spacing for readability. The core of the conflict is the amount of spacing (one line vs. two lines) and the presence of leading whitespace on an empty line in OTHER's version.

The leading whitespace on an otherwise empty line (`        ` followed by a newline) is stylistically unusual and likely an artifact rather than an intentional formatting choice. If OTHER's intent for two lines were to be adopted, this leading whitespace would ideally be removed.

However, the decision between one empty line and two empty lines is a matter of coding style, which can be subjective or governed by project-specific guidelines. Without such guidelines, or further context on the importance of the additional separation, choosing one over the other involves making a stylistic judgment.

Given the ambiguity in stylistic preference (one line vs. two lines) and the instruction to return the conflict if the intent is ambiguous or resolution is unsure, the most appropriate action is to return the snippet with the conflict markers intact. This allows a human developer with knowledge of the project's coding standards to make the final stylistic decision.

```java
            // with the new indexed key
            addShiftedKeyInfoIndex(initial, fromPkgr);
        }

        int total = current - initial;
