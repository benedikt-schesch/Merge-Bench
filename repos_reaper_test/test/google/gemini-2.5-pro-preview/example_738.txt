The merge conflict shows that the `HEAD` branch introduces a couple of lines of code, while the other branch (`c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c`) introduces no changes in the conflicting section.

Let's analyze the code:
The lines *before* the conflict are:
```java
        float finalPos = getTranslationY() + distance;
        if (finalPos > 0) {
            finalPos = 0;
        }
```
This code declares a variable `finalPos`, calculates its value, and then ensures it does not exceed 0. This seems to be the primary logic for determining `finalPos`.

The `HEAD` branch attempts to add the following lines *after* the block above:
```java
        float finalPos = getTranslationY() + distance;
        if (finalPos > 0) finalPos = 0;
```
This is problematic for two main reasons:
1.  **Variable Re-declaration**: It re-declares `finalPos` in the same scope. This would cause a compilation error: "Variable 'finalPos' is already defined in the scope".
2.  **Redundancy**: Even if the re-declaration were not an issue (e.g., if it used a different variable name or was in a different scope), the logic is identical to the code block immediately preceding it. It recalculates `getTranslationY() + distance` and re-applies the same capping logic (`if (finalPos > 0) finalPos = 0;`).

The other branch (`c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c`) has no lines in its part of the conflict. This means it intends for the code to be as it is with the common context, without the additions from `HEAD`.

**Semantic Intent:**
*   The common code (lines before the conflict) already correctly calculates and caps `finalPos`.
*   The `HEAD` branch seems to be erroneously duplicating this logic in a way that also introduces a compilation error.
*   The `c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c` branch makes no such addition, implicitly relying on the already existing logic.

The most sensible resolution is to remove the lines introduced by `HEAD`, as they are redundant and erroneous. This means accepting the "empty" change from the `c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c` branch for the conflicting section.

The resolved code will effectively remove the conflict markers and the content of the `HEAD` portion, leaving the surrounding context intact.

```java
        float finalPos = getTranslationY() + distance;
        if (finalPos > 0) {
            finalPos = 0;
        }

        setTranslationY(finalPos);

        if (getAlpha() == 0.0f) {
            setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
            setAlpha(1.0f);
```
