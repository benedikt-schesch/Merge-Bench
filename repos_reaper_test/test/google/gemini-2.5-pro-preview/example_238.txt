The conflict shows that both `HEAD` and the branch `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` are contributing an empty line between two comment blocks.

Specifically:
- The content from `HEAD` (between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`) is a single empty line.
- The content from `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` (between `=======` and `>>>>>>> ...`) is also a single empty line.

Since both branches agree on the content (an empty line), the resolution is to keep that empty line and remove the conflict markers. This maintains the separation between the two license comment blocks.
