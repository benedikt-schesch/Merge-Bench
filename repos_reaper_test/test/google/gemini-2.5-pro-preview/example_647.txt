To resolve the merge conflict, we need to consider the intent of both branches.
- The `HEAD` branch has no line in the conflicting section. This means it either removed a line that was previously there or simply had no specific import at this location.
- The `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` branch explicitly adds the static import `import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames;`. This suggests that code changes in this branch require this import for `getNames` to be used directly.

Semantically, when merging, the goal is typically to combine changes from both branches. Adding an import is a common change when new functionality that uses this import is introduced. Without further information suggesting this import is problematic or deprecated, the safest and most common resolution is to include the import added by the feature branch (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`). This ensures that any functionality relying on this import remains intact. If the import turned out to be unused after other conflict resolutions or refactorings, it would typically be flagged by an IDE or static analysis tool and could be removed later, but it's less likely to cause a compilation error than omitting a necessary import.

Therefore, the resolution is to include the line `import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames;`.
