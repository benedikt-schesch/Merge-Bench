To resolve the merge conflict, I will analyze the intent behind the changes from both sides.

**Conflict 1: Method Signature `isNotEqualTo`**

*   **`HEAD` version:**
    ```java
      public ShortAssert isNotEqualTo(short expected){
    ```
*   **`61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7` version:**
    ```java
      public ShortAssert isNotEqualTo(short expected) {
    ```
*   **Intent:** Both sides are defining the `isNotEqualTo` method. The only difference is a stylistic one: the presence of a space before the opening curly brace `{`.
*   **Resolution:** The version from `61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7` (with the space: `expected) {`) adheres to common Java coding conventions. This will be chosen for consistency and readability.

**Conflict 2: Trailing `<<<<<<< HEAD`**

*   **`HEAD` version:**
    ```java
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    // (followed by a blank line)
    ```
*   **`61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7` (implied):** No corresponding change is shown with `=======` and `>>>>>>>` markers in the provided snippet for this specific conflict. This typically means that the other branch had no changes at this location relative to the common ancestor, or `HEAD` is adding new content (in this case, a blank line) where there was previously nothing.
*   **Intent:** `HEAD` intends to have a blank line at this position. This is often for code formatting, such as separating method blocks or ensuring a newline at the end of a file.
*   **Resolution:** Adding a blank line after a method definition is a common and good practice for code readability. Therefore, `HEAD`'s change (the blank line) will be kept.

All surrounding context, including the initial `>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7` line and exact spacing of non-conflicting lines, will be preserved as per the instructions.

```java
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

  public ShortAssert isNotEqualTo(short expected) {
    shorts.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```
