Okay, I will analyze the semantic intents of both sides of the merge conflict to provide a resolution.

*   **HEAD (left side):**
    *   The `measureUser` method signature is `(TestUser user, ResultList recommendations, Context context)`.
    *   It calls `goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, context.recommender, user)`. This suggests that selecting "good items" depends on the `universe`, the specific `recommender` from the context, and the `user`.

*   **ae1b395ec63b1333c717fdac150e0860cf0326e0 (right side):**
    *   The `measureUser` method signature is `(TestUser user, int targetLength, ResultList recommendations, Context context)`. A new parameter `targetLength` has been introduced.
    *   It calls `goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, user)`. This suggests that selecting "good items" now only depends on the `universe` and the `user`, and the `recommender` from the context is no longer directly passed to this specific selection method.

**Reasoning for Resolution:**

The right side (`ae1b395ec...`) appears to introduce two distinct changes:
1.  Addition of a `targetLength` parameter to the `measureUser` method. This is likely a new requirement or feature related to how users are measured.
2.  A change in how `goodItems.selectItems` is called, by removing the `context.recommender` argument. This often indicates a refactoring of `goodItems.selectItems` itself, where it either no longer needs the recommender or obtains it through other means.

Generally, when one side introduces new parameters and modifies calls to underlying methods, it often represents a more evolved state of the code. If the `goodItems.selectItems` API has indeed changed to no longer require (or accept) the `recommender` argument, then the call from `HEAD` would be outdated or incorrect.

Assuming the `targetLength` parameter is a deliberate and necessary addition, and the change in `goodItems.selectItems` reflects an updated API or approach, the right side's changes should be adopted. This resolution combines the new functionality (`targetLength`) with the updated way of selecting good items.

Therefore, the resolution will adopt the method signature and the `goodItems.selectItems` call from the `ae1b395ec63b1333c717fdac150e0860cf0326e0` branch.

```java
        return new AggregateResult(context).withSuffix(suffix);
    }

    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public MetricResult measureUser(TestUser user, int targetLength, ResultList recommendations, Context context) {
        LongSet good = goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, user);
        if (good.isEmpty()) {
            logger.warn("no good items for user {}", user.getUserId());
        }

        Integer rank = null;
