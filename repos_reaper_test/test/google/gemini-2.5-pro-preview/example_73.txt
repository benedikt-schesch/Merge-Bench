Both sides of the merge conflict are trying to add the same field (`roundPermalinkFormatProvider`) and the same comment (`// All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.`). The conflict arises from the different ordering of these additions and the placement of a blank line.

* **HEAD's change:** Adds the field, then a blank line, then the comment.
* **The other commit's (5adedd248...) change:** Adds a blank line, then the comment, then the field.

The semantic intent is to include both the new field and the comment. A good resolution will preserve both and choose a sensible ordering and spacing.

Considering standard Java conventions:
1.  Fields are typically grouped together. The new `roundPermalinkFormatProvider` should ideally be placed with other `Provider` fields.
2.  The comment `// All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.` seems to be a general note or might refer to a group of subsequent fields. Placing such a comment before the fields it refers to, possibly separated by a blank line from preceding code, is a common practice.

The resolution chosen below adopts the structure where the blank line and comment precede the new field. This groups the new field `roundPermalinkFormatProvider` contiguously with the subsequent field `allowBlankCardsProvider`, and positions the comment before `roundPermalinkFormatProvider`, potentially introducing it and other "delay" related configurations. This aligns with the structure introduced by the commit `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a`.
