Okay, I will resolve the merge conflict by including the `import java.util.Iterator;` statement, as this is an additive change from one branch that is unlikely to cause issues and is probably required by other code introduced in that branch.

Here's the code with the conflict resolved:

```java
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
import com.restfb.util.DateUtils;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;

import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;
```
