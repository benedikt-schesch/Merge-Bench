To resolve the merge conflict, I will proceed with the following understanding of the intents:
1.  The first line in the `HEAD` portion of the conflict, `.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, BroadcastConnectsAndDisconnects.class));`, appears to be an unassigned expression. Given that `broadcastingUsers` is initialized later using a similar call, this initial line is likely a leftover or an error and should be removed.
2.  The branch `ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967` (referred to as "THEIRS") introduces settings for `cah.COOKIE_DOMAIN` and `cah.GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED`. These seem to be foundational and should be kept.
3.  `HEAD` introduces the initialization for `insecureIdAllowed`. This variable is used later in the common context, so its initialization is necessary.
4.  `THEIRS` introduces the usage of `gameChatEnabled` by appending `cah.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED`. This implies that `gameChatEnabled` is intended to be a new feature. For this line to be valid, `gameChatEnabled` must be defined elsewhere, presumably earlier in the changes from branch `ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967`. The resolution will include this line, assuming `gameChatEnabled` is defined in scope.

The resolved code will combine these intents by:
-   Removing the unassigned `.getInstance(...)` call.
-   Including the `COOKIE_DOMAIN` and `GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED` setup from `THEIRS`.
-   Including the `insecureIdAllowed` initialization from `HEAD`.
-   Including the `GAME_CHAT_ENABLED` setup from `THEIRS`.
-   Preserving the common context that follows.

The trailing `<<<<<<< HEAD` marker is unusual as it's incomplete. However, as per the instruction to not modify the context, it will be preserved.

```java
    builder.append(String.format("cah.COOKIE_DOMAIN = '%s';\n", cookieDomain));
    boolean globalChatEnabled = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, GlobalChatEnabled.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED = %b;\n", globalChatEnabled));
    boolean insecureIdAllowed = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, InsecureIdAllowed.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED = %b;\n", gameChatEnabled));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.INSECURE_ID_ALLOWED = %b;\n", insecureIdAllowed));
    boolean broadcastingUsers = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, BroadcastConnectsAndDisconnects.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.BROADCASTING_USERS = %b;\n", broadcastingUsers));
