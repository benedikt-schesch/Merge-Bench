Here's the resolved code snippet. Both branches were trying to add new imports. The resolution combines all new imports from both sides. For the block where multiple imports were added from different branches, they have been sorted alphabetically, which is a common convention. The import added by `HEAD` in the second conflicted block has also been included.

```java
import org.apache.pig.EvalFunc;
import org.apache.pig.FuncSpec;
import org.apache.pig.LoadFunc;
import org.apache.pig.PigServer;
import org.apache.pig.StoreFunc;
import org.apache.pig.ExecType;
import org.apache.pig.backend.datastorage.ElementDescriptor;
import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecException;
import org.apache.pig.builtin.COUNT;
import org.apache.pig.data.BagFactory;
import org.apache.pig.data.DataBag;
import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;
