Given the constraints that the surrounding context (including Javadoc not directly in the conflict markers and the method body) must not be modified, a semantic ambiguity arises.

Specifically:
1.  The Javadoc comment `* @param key Object` implies the third parameter should be named `key` and be of type `Object`.
2.  The method body line `this.keyWritable = keyWritable;` implies that there should be a parameter (or an accessible field/variable) named `keyWritable` that is assignable to `this.keyWritable`. Assuming `this.keyWritable` is of a type like `PigNullableWritable` (as suggested by the branch name), the parameter `keyWritable` should ideally be of this type.

Let's analyze the implications for each side of the conflict:
*   **HEAD's signature:** `public ReadOnceBag(LitePackager pkgr, Iterator<NullableTuple> tupIter, Object key)`
    *   Aligns with the Javadoc `* @param pkg POPackageLite` if `LitePackager` is the intended type for `POPackageLite`.
    *   Aligns with the Javadoc `* @param key Object`.
    *   Conflicts with the method body `this.keyWritable = keyWritable;` because there is no parameter named `keyWritable`; the parameter is `Object key`. This would lead to a compilation error.

*   **Branch's signature:** `public ReadOnceBag(Packager pkgr, Iterator<NullableTuple> tupIter, PigNullableWritable keyWritable)`
    *   Potentially misaligns with Javadoc `* @param pkg POPackageLite` if `Packager` is too generic or different from `LitePackager`'s relation to `POPackageLite`.
    *   Misaligns with Javadoc `* @param key Object` both in parameter name (`keyWritable` vs `key`) and type (`PigNullableWritable` vs `Object`).
    *   Aligns with the method body `this.keyWritable = keyWritable;` as it provides the `keyWritable` parameter.

Neither choice of signature, nor a simple combination, can satisfy all contextual constraints (Javadoc for parameters and method body usage) without modification of that context. For example, merging to use `LitePackager pkgr` (from HEAD, good for `@param pkg POPackageLite`) and `PigNullableWritable keyWritable` (from BRANCH, good for the method body) would still require changing the Javadoc `* @param key Object` to `* @param keyWritable PigNullableWritable`. Since modification of context (including this Javadoc line) is disallowed, a clean resolution isn't possible.

Due to this ambiguity and the inability to modify the provided context to create a consistent state, the conflict is returned as is.
