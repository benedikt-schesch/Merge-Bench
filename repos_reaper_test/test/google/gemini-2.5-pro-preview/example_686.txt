Given the nature of the provided snippet, particularly the truncation within the second conflict marker, it's not possible to fully ascertain the intent of the `83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965` side for the `logger.info` call. While the first conflict regarding the `text` variable seems resolvable towards the `83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965` version (which sorts principals and uses arguably more precise/updated terminology), the ambiguity in the second conflict prevents a complete and confident semantic merge.

The `83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965` branch generally seems to be making enhancements (sorting, adding an exclamation point for emphasis, and likely more detailed logging). However, without seeing the `83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965` side of the second conflict, any resolution would be speculative.

Therefore, as per the instructions, if the intent is ambiguous or if a confident resolution cannot be determined, the original snippet with the conflict should be returned.
