Okay, I will resolve the merge conflicts based on common Java styling conventions and readability.

**Conflict 1: Logging format**

*   **HEAD:**
    ```java
                LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "Cannot locate the JAXRS resource class.",
                        e);
    ```
*   **1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f:**
    ```java
                LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE,
                        "Cannot locate the JAXRS resource class.", e);
    ```

Both styles are syntactically correct and aim to log the same information. The choice is stylistic. The version from `1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f` separates the `Level` argument onto its own visual line (when wrapped), and then groups the `message string` and the `exception e` together on the next line. This grouping can be seen as slightly more logical, as the message and exception are closely related components of the error detail, while the level is a category. This format is also a common output from code formatters when arguments are wrapped.

**Conflict 2: Extra blank line**

*   **HEAD:**
    ```java
            return JaxRsIntrospector.getDefinition(jaxrsApplication,

    ```
    (has an extra blank line before the snippet ends, presumably before more arguments)
*   **1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f:**
    ```java
            return JaxRsIntrospector.getDefinition(jaxrsApplication,
    ```
    (no extra blank line)

An extra blank line in the middle of a method's argument list is unconventional and generally not desired. The version from `1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f` (no blank line) is preferred.

Therefore, I will choose the changes from branch `1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f` for both conflicts.

```java
        try {
            for (String c : jaxRsResources) {
                resources.add(Class.forName(c));
            }
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE,
                    "Cannot locate the JAXRS resource class.", e);
            System.exit(1);
        }
        Reference baseRef = endpoint != null ? new Reference(endpoint) : null;
        return JaxRsIntrospector.getDefinition(jaxrsApplication,
```
