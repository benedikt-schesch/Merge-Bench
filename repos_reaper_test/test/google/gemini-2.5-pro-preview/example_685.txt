To resolve the merge conflict, I'll analyze the intents of both `HEAD` and commit `83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965` for the conflicting block within the `logger.info` call.

Both branches are trying to log a warning message about missing users or groups (principals) during a deployment process, which affects node access rights.

**`HEAD` version:**
```java
					+ "\tThe following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for resource access permissions or node ownership during deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of these missing permissions/ownerships, node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported.\n\n"
					+ "\t" + String.join(", ",  missingPrincipals)
```
- Uses the term "resource access permissions".
- States "permissions/ownerships".
- Ends the sentence "imported." with a period.
- Lists `missingPrincipals` joined by a comma and space, on a single line.

**`83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965` version:**
```java
					+ "\tThe following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of these missing grants/ownerships, node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported!\n\n"
					+ "\t" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
```
- Uses the term "grants" instead of "resource access permissions". This might be a terminological refinement or standardization within the project. "Grants" can be a more precise or encompassing term for access rights.
- Consistently uses "grants/ownerships".
- Ends the sentence "imported!" with an exclamation mark, adding a bit more emphasis to the warning.
- Sorts the `missingPrincipals` and lists each on a new, indented line. This significantly improves readability, especially if there are multiple missing principals.

**Semantic Resolution:**
The changes in `83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965` appear to be enhancements:
1.  The switch from "resource access permissions" to "grants" is likely an intentional semantic update for clarity or correctness within the domain.
2.  The consistent use of "grants/ownerships" follows from this.
3.  The exclamation mark is a minor stylistic choice that fits the "Warning" context.
4.  The formatting of `missingPrincipals` (sorted and on separate lines) is a clear improvement for readability of the log output.

Combining these observations, the version from `83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965` is preferable as it maintains the core warning intent while improving terminology and presentation.

The line `>>>>>>> 83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965` at the beginning of the snippet is treated as part of the fixed context, as per the instructions.

```java
