The conflict arises from the type of `ObjectAdapter` being used: `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` in HEAD versus `SortedObjectAdapter` in the incoming commit.

Both branches are trying to achieve the same semantic goal:
1. Find an existing `ListRow`.
2. If found, get its adapter, cast it to a sorted adapter type, and add a `video` object.
3. If not found, create a new sorted adapter of that specific type (initialized with a `videoNameComparator` and `mCardPresenter`), add the `video` object to it, and then add this new adapter as a new row.

The key difference is the class type:
- `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` is a standard class in the Android Leanback library (`androidx.leanback.widget.SortedArrayObjectAdapter`). It extends `ArrayObjectAdapter` and provides sorting capabilities using a `Comparator`. This seems like a very fitting class for the described scenario.
- `SortedObjectAdapter` is not a standard concrete adapter class in the Leanback library. It could be a custom class within this project, an interface, or an older/renamed class. The usage `new SortedObjectAdapter(...)` suggests it's being treated as a concrete class in the incoming branch.

Given that `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` is a standard, well-defined Leanback component specifically designed for sorted lists of objects, and its constructor signature matches the usage (`videoNameComparator`, `mCardPresenter`), it is highly probable that this is the intended and more robust choice.
The change to `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` (HEAD) likely represents a refinement, a fix, or a move towards using standard library components over custom or less specific ones. The structural similarity of the code in both branches strongly suggests that one class name is a direct replacement or correction for the other, rather than representing fundamentally different logic.

Therefore, resolving in favor of `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` aligns with using standard library features and likely reflects the more up-to-date or correct implementation.

```java
            ListRow row = findListRow(getString(R.string.unmatched));

            // if found add this video
            // if not, create a new row and add it
            if (row != null) {
                ((SortedArrayObjectAdapter) row.getAdapter()).add(video);
            } else {
                SortedArrayObjectAdapter listRowAdapter = new SortedArrayObjectAdapter(
                        videoNameComparator, mCardPresenter);
                listRowAdapter.add(video);

                HeaderItem header = new HeaderItem(0, getString(R.string.unmatched), null);
                int index = mAdapter.size() > 1 ? mAdapter.size() - 1 : 0;
