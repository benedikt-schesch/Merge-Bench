To resolve the merge conflict, I will analyze the intent of the changes from both `HEAD` and the incoming branch (`f8f91f1d455f6842ca57b8294f6a263ff0cde1e4`).

**HEAD's Intent:**
HEAD introduces the import:
`com.alorma.github.ui.activity.base.BackActivity`
This suggests that some code modified in HEAD now requires `BackActivity`.

**f8f91f1d455f6842ca57b8294f6a263ff0cde1e4's Intent:**
This branch introduces the imports:
`com.alorma.github.ui.activity.base.RepositoryThemeActivity`
`com.alorma.github.utils.AttributesUtils`
This suggests that changes in this branch require `RepositoryThemeActivity` (possibly as a base class for an activity) and a utility class `AttributesUtils` (perhaps for theming or styling).

**Common Imports:**
The imports `com.alorma.github.ui.utils.IntentHelper` and `com.alorma.github.ui.utils.uris.UriUtils` are present in both sides of the conflict. This means they are not part of the conflicting changes themselves but are common lines within the diff hunk. They should be preserved.

**Resolution Strategy:**
For import statements, the most common and safest resolution strategy when different classes are imported by conflicting branches is to include all unique imports from both sides. This ensures that all classes potentially needed by the merged code are available. Any unused imports can typically be identified and removed by IDEs or linters later.

The semantic conflict might lie deeper in the code (e.g., if a class's base type was changed differently in both branches). However, for the import block itself, combining the imports is the best approach without further context on the code using these imports.

**Proposed Merged Imports:**
I will combine the unique imports from both branches and maintain the common ones. The imports will be ordered logically, typically alphabetically or grouped by package structure.

1.  `com.alorma.github.ui.activity.base.BackActivity` (from HEAD)
2.  `com.alorma.github.ui.activity.base.RepositoryThemeActivity` (from f8f91f1d...)
3.  `com.alorma.github.ui.utils.IntentHelper` (common)
4.  `com.alorma.github.ui.utils.uris.UriUtils` (common)
5.  `com.alorma.github.utils.AttributesUtils` (from f8f91f1d...)

This order keeps related base activity imports together, followed by UI utilities, and then other utilities. This resolution ensures that all dependencies introduced by both branches are made available.
