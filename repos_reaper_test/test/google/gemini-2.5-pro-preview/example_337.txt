The conflict arises in the `onCreateOptionsMenu` method.
-   **`HEAD`** intends to add two specific menu items: "Replies" (or "Mentions") and "Direct Messages". This is typical for adding new features or ensuring existing ones are present.
-   **`ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62`** intends for this block of code to be empty, meaning no menu items are programmatically added here. This could be because these features were never part of this branch, or they were intentionally removed (e.g., deprecated, or moved to an XML menu definition, or to a different UI paradigm).

Without further information (like commit messages, related changes in other files, or project conventions), it's ambiguous whether the menu items from `HEAD` are desired new functionality or if the empty state from `ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62` represents a deliberate removal or refactoring that should take precedence.

For example:
1.  If `HEAD` is a feature branch adding these menu items and `ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62` is the target main branch that didn't have them, then keeping `HEAD`'s changes is appropriate.
2.  If `HEAD` is the main branch containing these items, and `ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62` is a branch where these items were intentionally removed (e.g., as part of a UI overhaul), then `ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62`'s change (emptiness) might be desired.

Given this ambiguity in intent, the conflict should be reviewed by someone with more project-specific knowledge. Therefore, I will return the snippet with the conflict markers.

```java
	}

	// Menu.
	@Override
	public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		MenuItem item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_REPLIES, 0, R.string.page_title_mentions);
		item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_revert);

		item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_DM, 0, R.string.page_title_direct_messages);
		item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_send);
