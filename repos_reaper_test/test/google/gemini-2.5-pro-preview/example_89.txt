The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict where both sides (HEAD and commit `ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967`) are attempting to define an annotation.
- HEAD introduces `public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {`.
- The other branch introduces `public @interface AllowBlankCards { }`.

Semantically, `ServerDiscoveryPort` and `AllowBlankCards` represent distinct concepts (likely a network port configuration and a game rule setting, respectively). This suggests that the intent is likely for both annotations to exist, resulting from parallel feature development.

However, there are ambiguities in the provided snippet that prevent a definitive resolution:
1.  The definition for `ServerDiscoveryPort` from HEAD is incomplete in the first conflict block; it's missing its closing brace `}`. This brace might be part of HEAD's contribution in the second conflict region, but that region is itself incomplete in the snippet.
2.  The second conflict marker `<<<<<<< HEAD` appears after two new lines (`@BindingAnnotation` and `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)`), but the snippet does not show the actual content from HEAD for this second conflict (it only shows a blank line following the marker), nor does it show the `=======` or `>>>>>>>` parts. This makes it impossible to determine HEAD's full intent for this section or how it relates to the `ServerDiscoveryPort` annotation or potentially another new annotation.

Due to these ambiguities and the incompleteness of the conflict representation in the snippet, it's not possible to confidently perform a semantic merge that correctly captures the intent of both sides for the entire snippet. Therefore, the snippet is returned with the conflict markers intact.
