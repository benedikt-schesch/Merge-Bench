The conflict is between using `context.getDfs()` and `context.getFs()` to obtain a `DataStorage` (or compatible `FileSystem`) object for checking file existence.

- `HEAD` uses `context.getDfs()`. `Dfs` typically stands for "Distributed File System" (e.g., HDFS in the context of Pig). This implies that the file existence check is intended specifically for the distributed file system.
- The branch `1488b22...` uses `context.getFs()`. `Fs` typically stands for "File System" and is often a more generic accessor.

The intent of a method like `fileExists(String filename, PigContext context)` is generally to determine if a file exists, regardless of whether Pig is running in local mode or distributed mode, and potentially handling different URI schemes in `filename` (e.g., `file:///`, `hdfs:///`).

Assuming `context.getFs()` is designed to be a more general or context-aware accessor for the file system, it would be semantically preferable:
1.  If Pig is running in local mode, `context.getFs()` might provide access to the local file system for unqualified paths, while `context.getDfs()` would still point to HDFS, potentially leading to incorrect results for local files.
2.  If `filename` can include URI schemes, `context.getFs()` might be part of a system that correctly dispatches to the appropriate file system, or returns a default file system that can handle various schemes.
3.  It's a common refactoring pattern to introduce methods like `getFs()` to provide a more abstract or intelligent way to access file systems over specific ones like  `getDfs()` or `getLfs()` (Local File System).

Given these considerations, `context.getFs()` is likely intended to be the more robust and universally applicable choice for a generic utility like `fileExists`. It aligns better with the expectation that such a utility should work correctly across different execution modes and path types that Pig supports.

Therefore, the resolution will use `context.getFs()`.

```java
        }
    }

    public static boolean fileExists(String filename, PigContext context)
            throws IOException {
        return fileExists(filename, context.getFs());
    }

    public static boolean fileExists(String filename, DataStorage store)
            throws IOException {
        ElementDescriptor elem = store.asElement(filename);
