The merge conflict occurs in the way arguments are formatted for the `getDefinitionFromJaxrsSources` method call.
Both sides of the conflict (HEAD and 1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f) intend to call the same method with the exact same five arguments in the same order: `defSource`, `useSectionNamingPackageStrategy`, `applicationName`, `endpoint`, and `jaxRsResources`.
The difference is purely stylistic, relating to line breaks and line length for the arguments.

*   **HEAD version:**
    ```java
    definition = getDefinitionFromJaxrsSources(defSource,
            useSectionNamingPackageStrategy, applicationName,
            endpoint, jaxRsResources);
    ```
    This version breaks the arguments across three lines:
    1.  `defSource,`
    2.  `useSectionNamingPackageStrategy, applicationName,`
    3.  `endpoint, jaxRsResources);`
    The continuation lines are indented consistently. This style often enhances readability for long argument lists by keeping individual lines shorter.

*   **Incoming version (1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f):**
    ```java
    definition = getDefinitionFromJaxrsSources(defSource, useSectionNamingPackageStrategy, applicationName,
            endpoint, jaxRsResources);
    ```
    This version formats the arguments across two lines:
    1.  `defSource, useSectionNamingPackageStrategy, applicationName,`
    2.  `endpoint, jaxRsResources);`
    This style is more compact but can result in a longer first line.

**Semantic Analysis:**
Semantically, both versions are identical. They will result in the same bytecode and the same runtime behavior. The conflict is non-semantic.

**Resolution Decision:**
Given that the semantic intent is identical, the choice is stylistic. In the absence of a specific project style guide, a common approach is to favor readability or maintain consistency. The HEAD version, by breaking the arguments into more lines, can be considered slightly more readable if the argument names are long or if there's a preference for shorter lines of code. It also aligns with common Java formatting practices where long parameter lists are broken down and aligned.

Therefore, I will resolve the conflict by choosing the formatting from HEAD.

```java
                    LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "Class " + defSource
                            + " is not supported");
                    System.exit(1);
                }
            } else if (!jaxRsResources.isEmpty()) {
                definition = getDefinitionFromJaxrsSources(defSource,
                        useSectionNamingPackageStrategy, applicationName,
                        endpoint, jaxRsResources);
            }
        }

        if (definition == null) {
