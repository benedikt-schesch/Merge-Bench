Okay, I will resolve the merge conflict.
The conflict is purely stylistic, concerning the number and formatting of blank lines after the line `this.properties = properties;`.

*   **HEAD version**: Proposes one blank line, indented with 8 spaces.
    ```java
            this.properties = properties;   
            // <--- This line contains 8 spaces
            String pigJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(Main.class);
    ```
*   **Branch `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c309` version**: Proposes two blank lines. The first is not indented (it's completely empty). The second is indented with 8 spaces.
    ```java
            this.properties = properties;   
    // <--- This line is completely empty (0 spaces)
            // <--- This line contains 8 spaces
            String pigJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(Main.class);
    ```

**Intent Analysis:**
*   Both sides intend to add vertical whitespace after the initial property assignments in the constructor, before the logic for JAR handling begins. This is to improve readability by separating logical blocks of code.
*   HEAD intends one blank line.
*   Branch `1488b22...` intends two blank lines.

**Semantic Resolution:**
The actual code execution is not affected by this change. This is a purely stylistic choice.
When comparing the two options as literally presented:
1.  HEAD's version (one indented blank line) is stylistically consistent. The blank line's indentation matches the surrounding code block's indentation (8 spaces).
2.  Branch `1488b22...`'s version (one non-indented blank line followed by one indented blank line) is stylistically inconsistent. Mixing indentation styles for consecutive blank lines is unusual and generally not preferred.

Given this inconsistency in the `1488b22...` version, HEAD's version provides a cleaner and more standard formatting approach. A single, consistently indented blank line is a common way to separate logical segments within a method.

Therefore, I will resolve the conflict by choosing HEAD's version.

```java
    }
        
    public PigContext(ExecType execType, Properties properties){
        this.execType = execType;
        this.properties = properties;   
        
        String pigJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(Main.class);
        String hadoopJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(FileSystem.class);
        if (pigJar != null) {
            skipJars.add(pigJar);
            if (!pigJar.equals(hadoopJar))

```
