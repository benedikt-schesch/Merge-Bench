Choosing one specific service over the other implies a decision about the project's direction or current state regarding custom card/deck functionality.
- `HEAD` suggests the use of `CustomCardsService`. This could be a more generic service, an internally developed one, or a newer replacement.
- The branch `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a` suggests the use of `CardcastService`. "Cardcast" was a specific online service for user-created decks for games like Cards Against Humanity.

If `HEAD` represents the main line of development (e.g., `main` or `develop` branch), it's common that infrastructural or service choices made on this line reflect the current architectural standard for the project. If `CustomCardsService` is present in `HEAD`, it's likely the intended service to use. The conflicting change from the other branch might be based on an older version of the codebase (before `CustomCardsService` was introduced or `CardcastService` was phased out) or represent an alternative approach that is not aligned with the current direction in `HEAD`.

Assuming `CustomCardsService` is the intended evolution (e.g., a more generic replacement for a specific integration like Cardcast, or Cardcast itself was renamed/refactored to this more generic term), the version from `HEAD` would be the preferred resolution. This is a common pattern where specific third-party integrations are either generalized or replaced over time.

Therefore, the resolution will keep `CustomCardsService`.
