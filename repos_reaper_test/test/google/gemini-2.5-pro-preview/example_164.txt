The conflict is purely stylistic, concerning how a single Java statement is formatted across one or two lines. Both versions are semantically identical: they both assign the result of `pigContext.getDfs().asElement(fullPath(fileSpec, pigContext))` to the variable `elem`.

*   **HEAD version:**
    ```java
                ElementDescriptor elem = pigContext.getDfs().
                asElement(fullPath(fileSpec, pigContext));
    ```
    This version splits the statement into two lines. The line break is after the `.` in `pigContext.getDfs().`. The continued line `asElement(...)` is indented to the same level as the beginning of the statement (`ElementDescriptor ...`). This formatting style is often used to improve readability for long lines or to adhere to line length limits. The first line would be `12 (indent) + 19 (ElementDescriptor) + 1 ( ) + 4 (elem) + 1 ( ) + 1 (=) + 1 ( ) + 19 (pigContext.getDfs) + 1 (.) = 58` characters. The second line would be `12 (indent) + 10 (asElement) + 1 (() + 24 (fullPath(...)) + 1 ()) + 1 (;) = 49` characters. Both are well within typical line limits.

*   **Version `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`:**
    ```java
                ElementDescriptor elem = pigContext.getDfs().asElement(fullPath(fileSpec, pigContext));
    ```
    This version keeps the entire statement on a single line. The length of the code part is `19 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 19 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 24 + 1 + 1 = 82` characters. With the 12-space indentation, the total line length is `12 + 82 = 94` characters. This length might be acceptable in projects with a 100 or 120-character line limit, but could exceed stricter limits (e.g., 80 characters).

**Resolution reasoning:**

When a merge conflict is purely stylistic, the best approach is to adhere to the project's established coding style. If no explicit style guide is available, a common strategy is to prefer the version from the target branch (usually `HEAD` when merging changes into it). This assumes that `HEAD` reflects the most current or desired state of the codebase, including formatting conventions.

The `HEAD` version applies a specific line-breaking and indentation strategy that is a valid and common way to format code, especially to manage line length or improve readability of chained method calls. The single-line version from commit `1488b22...` is also valid but results in a longer line (94 characters including indentation).

Assuming `HEAD` is the target branch, its formatting convention (the multi-line version) is chosen to resolve the conflict. This choice implies that the formatting in `HEAD` is either the established style or a deliberate change towards a preferred style (e.g., for better readability or adherence to line length limits).

```java
    
    static public InputStream open(String fileSpec, PigContext pigContext) throws IOException {
        fileSpec = checkDefaultPrefix(pigContext.getExecType(), fileSpec);
        if (!fileSpec.startsWith(LOCAL_PREFIX)) {
            init(pigContext);
            ElementDescriptor elem = pigContext.getDfs().
            asElement(fullPath(fileSpec, pigContext));
            return openDFSFile(elem);
        }
        else {
            fileSpec = fileSpec.substring(LOCAL_PREFIX.length());
            //buffering because we only want buffered streams to be passed to load functions.
