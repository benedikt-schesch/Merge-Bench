Okay, I will resolve the merge conflict. Both sides of the conflict (HEAD and commit `f6a8f7aa...`) are attempting to ensure there is a blank line after the `LOG` declaration and before the `mapStores` declaration.

*   The `HEAD` version introduces a blank line that contains 4 spaces (matching the indentation of the surrounding code lines).
*   The `f6a8f7aa...` version introduces a blank line that contains no spaces (it's just a newline character).

Semantically, both changes achieve the same goal: a single visual blank line for separation. The difference is purely stylistic regarding the content of that blank line.

I will choose the `HEAD` version because it explicitly includes the indentation spaces on the blank line, which is consistent with the indentation formatting of the adjacent code lines. This is a common and clean way to represent an indented blank line.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict resolved by taking the `HEAD` version for the conflicting part:

```java

    // currently counters are not working in local mode - see PIG-1286
    public static final String SUCCESS_HEADER_LOCAL = "JobId\tAlias\tFeature\tOutputs";

    private static final Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(MRJobStats.class);
    
    private List<POStore> mapStores = null;

    private List<POStore> reduceStores = null;

    private List<FileSpec> loads = null;

```
