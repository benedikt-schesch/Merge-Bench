To resolve the merge conflict, I'll analyze the intents of both branches:

1.  **First Conflict (Method Signature):**
    *   `HEAD`: `public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected){` (no space before the opening brace `{` and no space before the closing parenthesis `)` if parameters end there, but here it's `expected){`).
    *   `61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7`: `public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected) {` (space before the opening brace `{` and a space after `expected` before `)`).
    *   **Intent:** The core difference is stylistic. The version from `61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7` (`long expected) {`) adheres to more common Java coding conventions regarding spacing in method signatures.
    *   **Resolution:** I will choose `public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected) {`.

2.  **Second Conflict (Trailing Newline):**
    *   After the `isEqualTo` method's closing brace `}`, there is an existing blank line in the provided snippet.
    *   `HEAD`: Introduces another blank line via `<<<<<<< HEAD` followed by a blank line. This would result in two blank lines after the method.
    *   `61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7`: The contribution for this part of the conflict is not shown (the snippet ends after HEAD's part). If we assume the other branch made no change here or intended a standard single blank line, then HEAD is adding an extra, potentially superfluous, blank line.
    *   **Intent:** `HEAD` seems to want two blank lines after the method. Standard Java practice is usually one blank line.
    *   **Resolution:** I will opt for a single blank line after the method, which is more conventional. This means not including HEAD's additional blank line from the second conflict. The blank line already present in the context before the second conflict marker will be preserved.

Combining these resolutions:

```java

  protected LongAssert(Long actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, LongAssert.class, description);
  }

  public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected) {
    longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```
