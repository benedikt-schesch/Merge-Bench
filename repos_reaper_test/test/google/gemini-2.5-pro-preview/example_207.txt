Given the merge conflict, let's analyze the intents:

1.  **First Conflict (DataAtom import):**
    *   `HEAD` includes `import org.apache.pig.data.DataAtom;`. This implies that the code in `HEAD` uses or relied on the `DataAtom` class.
    *   The other branch (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) has this import removed. This suggests that the code in this branch no longer uses `DataAtom`.
    *   **Semantic Analysis:** `org.apache.pig.data.DataAtom` is a deprecated class in Apache Pig. Modern Pig UDFs should use standard Java types (Integer, Long, String, etc.) or `org.apache.pig.data.DataByteArray` directly instead of wrapping them in `DataAtom`. The removal of this import in branch `1488b22ce...` likely indicates a refactoring or modernization effort to remove usage of the deprecated `DataAtom` class.
    *   **Resolution:** Semantically, it's preferable to align with the removal of deprecated classes. Therefore, the version from branch `1488b22ce...` (which removes the import) is the better choice, assuming the corresponding code changes that eliminate `DataAtom` usage are also part of this merge (which is typical for such refactorings).

2.  **Second Conflict (Trailing `<<<<<<< HEAD`):**
    *   The snippet shows `<<<<<<< HEAD` followed by a blank line, appearing after all other imports and an existing blank line.
    *   This conflict marker is incomplete as it lacks the `=======` and `>>>>>>> other_branch_commit_hash` parts.
    *   **Semantic Analysis & Assumption:** Assuming this is a conflict over a trailing newline at the end of the relevant section or file:
        *   `HEAD`'s version includes an additional newline character.
        *   The other branch (`1488b22ce...`, implied) does not include this newline character here (it might remove one or simply not have one).
        *   It's a common convention and often preferred by linters/formatters that files end with a newline character.
    *   **Resolution:** If `HEAD` is trying to ensure a newline at this position (perhaps end-of-file or end of logical block), and the other branch omits it, keeping `HEAD`'s version (the newline) is a reasonable default choice, aligning with common best practices.

**Combined Resolution:**
Based on this analysis, the `DataAtom` import will be removed, and the newline from `HEAD` in the second conflict will be kept.

import org.apache.pig.EvalFunc;
import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.schema.Schema;

// This blank line was context before the second conflict marker.
// The content from HEAD for the second conflict (another blank line) is preserved.
