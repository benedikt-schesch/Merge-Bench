The conflict arises because `HEAD` introduces an `@AfterEach` method to verify no interactions with the `workspace` mock, while the incoming commit `ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586` effectively removes this verification (or ensures it's not present).

**Intent of HEAD:**
To enforce stricter testing by ensuring that any interactions with the `workspace` mock are explicitly accounted for in each test (either via stubbing or verification). This helps catch unexpected side-effects or unintended coupling with the `workspace`.

**Intent of ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586:**
To not have this global, strict verification after each test. This might be because:
1.  Interactions with `workspace` are common and often benign or part of setup, and verifying/stubbing them in every test would be overly verbose or lead to brittle tests.
2.  The verification was found to be problematic for specific test cases being developed in that branch.

**Resolution:**
Adding an `@AfterEach` verification like `verifyNoInteractions` is generally a good practice for improving test quality and mock hygiene. It forces tests to be more explicit about their interactions with collaborators. Unless there's a strong, documented reason why this specific verification is detrimental or unsuitable for this test class (e.g., `workspace` is pervasively and benignly used, making the check overly burdensome), it is generally preferable to keep such a verification.

Assuming the `HEAD` change was a deliberate enhancement to test robustness, and without further information justifying the removal by the incoming change, the resolution favors keeping the stricter verification. This promotes explicit declaration of mock interactions. If this proves to be too cumbersome for practical reasons in this class, it can be revisited and removed with a clear justification later.

Therefore, we will choose the version from `HEAD`.

```java
	void inContext() {
		workspace = mock(WorkspaceFacade.class);
		processor = new ClassFileChangeProcessor(workspace);
	}

	@AfterEach
	void verifyWorkspace() {
		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

	@Test
	void shouldNotRespondToPreBuildEvents() {
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, PRE_BUILD, AUTO_BUILD, null);
		assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event));
