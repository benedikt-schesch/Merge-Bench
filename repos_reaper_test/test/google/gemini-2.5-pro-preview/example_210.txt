The conflict shows two attempts to declare a `Session session;` field.

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
// This part is from HEAD. It introduces:
// 1. A blank line.
// 2. The line "	Session session;" (indented with a tab).

	Session session;
=======
// This part is from branch 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309.
// It is empty, meaning this branch didn't have conflicting lines *between* these markers,
// or it deleted what HEAD was modifying.
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
// This part is what exists after the conflicting section, effectively representing
// the state that the other branch (1488b22...) contributes or what was common/base.
// It includes:
// 1. A blank line.
// 2. The line "    Session session;" (indented with 4 spaces).

    Session session;
```

Both sides intend to have a `Session session;` field. The primary differences are:
1.  **Duplication**: If both were kept, it would be a duplicate field declaration.
2.  **Indentation**: `HEAD` uses a tab, while the version after the `>>>>>>>` marker uses 4 spaces.
3.  **Placement**: The conflict structure suggests `HEAD` is adding its version, while the other version is also present.

**Resolution**:
The field `private static final Log log` and `ChannelDirectTCPIP channel` are both indented with 4 spaces. For consistency, the `Session session;` field should also use 4-space indentation. The version appearing after the `>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` marker fits this style and also correctly includes a preceding blank line, maintaining separation between field declarations.

Therefore, the intent is best served by keeping the version `    Session session;` (with its preceding blank line) and discarding the `HEAD` version (`\tSession session;` and its preceding blank line). This resolves the duplication and maintains consistent code style.

```java
 * things to SSH.
 */
class SSHSocketImpl extends SocketImpl {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImpl.class);

    Session session;

    ChannelDirectTCPIP channel;
```
