Okay, I will resolve the merge conflict by choosing the version from HEAD, as its comment provides a clear and well-placed explanation for the subsequent conditional block. This comment complements the existing comment within the `if` block by offering a general reason for the check, while the inner comment provides a more specific context.

Here's the code with the conflict resolved:

```java

        addJarsFromProperties();
        markPredeployedJarsFromProperties();

        PigStats.start(pigContext.getExecutionEngine().instantiatePigStats());
        // ScriptState may have been initialized in Main. In that case, we
        // should not overwrite it.
        if (ScriptState.get() == null) {
            // If Pig was started via command line, ScriptState should have been
            // already initialized in Main. If so, we should not overwrite it.
            ScriptState.start(pigContext.getExecutionEngine().instantiateScriptState());
        }

```
