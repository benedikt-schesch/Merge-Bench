The conflict arises from a difference in formatting for the method signature, specifically how the `throws IOException` clause is placed and indented, and a trailing space in one of the versions. Both versions are semantically identical in terms of the Java code's behavior.

-   **HEAD** places `throws IOException {` on the same line as the method parameters.
-   **1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81** places `throws IOException {` on a new line with additional indentation. It also includes a trailing space after `Configuration originalConf)`.

The intent of both branches is to define the `mergeSplitSpecificConf` method with the same parameters and the same `throws` clause. The difference is purely stylistic.

Given that the semantic meaning is identical, the resolution can be based on common coding style preferences:
1.  The trailing space in the `1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81` version (`originalConf) `) is generally undesirable.
2.  Placing the `throws` clause on the same line as the method signature (as in HEAD) is a common and acceptable Java style, especially when the line length is manageable.
3.  The specific indentation of the `throws` clause in `1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81` (`            throws IOException {`) is a valid stylistic choice but might be less common than same-line or a standard next-line indent.

Considering these points, the HEAD version appears to be a cleaner and more standard representation.

```java
     * is based and merge it with the Conf supplied
     *
     * package level access so that this is not publicly used elsewhere
     * @throws IOException
     */
    static void mergeSplitSpecificConf(LoadFunc loadFunc, PigSplit pigSplit, Configuration originalConf)
    throws IOException {
        // set up conf with entries from input specific conf
        Job job = new Job(originalConf);
        loadFunc.setLocation(getLoadLocation(pigSplit.getInputIndex(),
                originalConf), job);
        // The above setLocation call could write to the conf within
