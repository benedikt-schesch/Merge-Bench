To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine the semantic intent of both changes.

*   **HEAD** introduces `private ProfilePictureSource picture;`
*   **a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe** introduces `private Picture picture;`

Both sides aim to define a field named `picture`. The conflict lies in the type of this field.

Consider the semantics:
1.  **Specificity**: `ProfilePictureSource` is a more specific type name than `Picture`. If this field is indeed intended to store a user's profile picture, `ProfilePictureSource` communicates this intent more clearly and might carry more specific attributes relevant to a profile picture (e.g., links to different sizes, source information).
2.  **Context**: The field is annotated with `@Getter` and `@Setter` and has a Javadoc comment `   * @since 1.6.16`, indicating it's a relatively recent addition or modification. In evolving codebases, there's often a trend towards more descriptive and specific types for better domain modeling.
3.  **Assumed Intent**: Assuming the class containing this field is related to a user or profile, the most likely intent for a field named `picture` is to hold profile picture data. `ProfilePictureSource` aligns well with this. If `Picture` were a new, more generic framework type intended to replace specialized types, one might choose `Picture`. However, without further information, choosing the more descriptive and specific type (`ProfilePictureSource`) is generally preferred for clarity and maintainability, as it better reflects the specific kind of "picture" being handled.

Given these considerations, `ProfilePictureSource` appears to be the more semantically appropriate choice, as it provides more specific information about the nature of the `picture` field.

The resolved code will use `private ProfilePictureSource picture;`. The surrounding context, including the unusual first line `>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` (which appears to be the end marker of a *previous* unrelated conflict in the file snippet provided), will be preserved as requested.
