The conflict arises from different visibility modifiers for the inner class `POPackageTupleBuffer`.
- `HEAD` specifies `public class POPackageTupleBuffer`, making the class accessible from any other class.
- Commit `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a` specifies `class POPackageTupleBuffer`, giving it package-private access (default visibility), meaning it's only accessible from within the same package.

The semantic intent of `HEAD` is to expose this inner class more widely, potentially for use outside of its package.
The semantic intent of `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a` is to restrict the visibility of this inner class, possibly as an encapsulation measure, limiting its use to within its own package.

Without understanding *why* `HEAD` requires public access (e.g., if there's new code in another package that uses this class) or *why* the other branch restricted access (e.g., as part of a refactoring to internalize its use), it's impossible to determine the correct resolution. Choosing one over the other might either break functionality (if public access is necessary) or undermine a deliberate design choice (if stricter encapsulation was intended and safe).

Given this ambiguity in intent and the potential impact of an incorrect resolution, the conflict should be presented to a developer with more context on the changes in both branches. Therefore, I will return the snippet with the conflict markers intact.

```java
        clone.numInputs = numInputs;
        clone.pkgr = (Packager) this.pkgr.clone();
        return clone;
