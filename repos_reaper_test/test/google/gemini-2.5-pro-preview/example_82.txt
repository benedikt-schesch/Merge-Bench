Given the constraints and the provided context:

1.  The conflict occurs in a file that, according to HEAD, is `src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomBlackCard.java`. This implies the class name, and therefore the constructor name, should be `CustomBlackCard`.
2.  The lines of code *after* the conflict block are:
    ```java
    this.id = id;
    this.text = text;
    this.draw = draw;
    this.pick = pick;
    this.watermark = watermark;
    ```
    Crucially, the line `this.watermark = watermark;` must not be modified as it's part of the surrounding context. This line requires a variable named `watermark` to be in scope, which would typically be a constructor parameter.

Based on these points:

*   The constructor from HEAD is `public CustomBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick, final String watermark)`. This matches the class name `CustomBlackCard` and provides a `watermark` parameter, which is consistent with the line `this.watermark = watermark;`.

*   The constructor from the branch (`5adedd248...`) is `public CardcastBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick, final String deckId)`.
    *   The constructor name `CardcastBlackCard` does not match the filename `CustomBlackCard.java`.
    *   It uses `deckId` as the parameter name. If this signature were chosen for a `CustomBlackCard` constructor (i.e., `public CustomBlackCard(..., final String deckId)`), the subsequent line `this.watermark = watermark;` would result in a compile error, as `watermark` would be undefined ( P(assuming `deckId` was meant for the field `this.watermark`).

The semantic intent of HEAD is to define a constructor for `CustomBlackCard` that takes an explicit `watermark`. The semantic intent of the branch is to define a constructor for a (potentially new or renamed) class `CardcastBlackCard` where the concept of a watermark is represented by `deckId`.

Given that the context (filename from HEAD, and the subsequent assignment `this.watermark = watermark;`) is fixed, the most coherent resolution is to use the constructor definition from HEAD. This ensures the code remains syntactically correct and respects the established structure of `CustomBlackCard`.

```java
  private final String text;
  private final int draw;
  private final int pick;
  private final String watermark;

  public CustomBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick, final String watermark) {
    this.id = id;
    this.text = text;
    this.draw = draw;
    this.pick = pick;
    this.watermark = watermark;

```
