Here's the correctly resolved code snippet, with the merge conflict addressed by selecting the appropriate semantics from both branches while preserving the full context and spacing:

---

```java
		when(coreRegistry.getCore(projectAUri)).thenReturn(core);
		return core;
	}

	@Test
	public void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun() throws CoreException {
		InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 0);

		workspace.updateProjects(Collections.singleton(resource));

		assertStatusIs(noTestsRun());
		verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));
```

### Explanation of Resolution:

- **Conflict Summary**:  
  - `<<<<<<< HEAD` showed a method signature:  
    ```java
    void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun() throws CoreException {
    	InfinitestCore core = prepateCore(projectAUri(), 0);
    ```
  - While `>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586` showed:
    ```java
    public void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun() throws CoreException {
    	InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 0);
    ```
  
- **Resolution Choices**:
  - Chose **`public void`** because JUnit best practices (especially for JUnit 4, which uses `@Test` in this style) require test methods to be `public`. This was missing in the `HEAD` version.
  - Chose **`prepareCore(...)`** instead of `prepateCore(...)` since the latter appears to be a typo, and the latter branch has corrected it.
  - The remainder of the method body is consistent across both branches, so no additional decisions were necessary there.

- **Final Judgment**: The chosen resolution reflects the semantically correct intention of both branches: fixing the typo, keeping the method public, and maintaining the logic of the test.
