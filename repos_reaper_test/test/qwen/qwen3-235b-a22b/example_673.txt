The semantically correct resolution is to retain the `displayName` parameter in the constructor because the field exists and is `final`, which requires initialization in all constructor paths. The HEAD version correctly initializes `this.displayName`, whereas the commit version omits it, which would lead to a compilation error unless the field was changed (e.g., non-final or initialization at declaration), but no such indication exists in the provided code.

### Merged Snippet

```java

	private final UriTemplate authorizeUrl;
	
	private final String accessTokenUrl;

	public AccountProviderParameters(String name, String displayName, String apiKey, String secret, Long appId,
			String requestTokenUrl, String authorizeUrl, String callbackUrl, String accessTokenUrl) {
		this.name = name;
		this.displayName = displayName;
		this.apiKey = apiKey;
		this.secret = secret;
		this.appId = appId;

```
