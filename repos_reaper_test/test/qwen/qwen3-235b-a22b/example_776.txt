The merge conflict occurs in a list of command syntax descriptors for a system, likely a command-line interface. The relevant lines describe the available commands and their usage.

---

### Conflict Area Analysis
The conflict is between the following two code versions:

- `HEAD`: The current branch does **not** include a line with the `mscan` command.
- `d5436090513...`: The branch being merged **does** include a new line introducing the `mscan` command.

This implies that the `mscan` command was added in the `d5436090513...` branch and was not present in the current `HEAD`.

---

### Semantic Intent
- The `mscan` line introduces a new scanning command variant, likely supporting more complex or multi-column scans.
- It is positioned **between** `scan` and `cas`, which follows a logical placement: both `scan` and `mscan` are scanning operations, while `cas` implies compare-and-set.

Given that this is a feature introduced in the other branch, and assuming it has valid functionality, the semantic intent would be to retain it unless there is a clear reason not to.

---

### Resolution Recommendation
To honor the intent of the merge — incorporating both histories — it is appropriate to **keep the `mscan` line**, resolving the conflict with the version from the `d5436090513...` branch.

### Final Code
```java
                       + "  get <table> <key> [family] [qualifiers ...]\n"
                       + "  icv <table> <key> <family> <qualifier> [amount]\n"
                       + "  put <table> <key> <family> <qualifier> <value>\n"
                       + "  delete <table> <key> [<family> [<qualifier>]]\n"
                       + "  scan <table> [start] [family] [qualifier] [stop] [regexp]\n"
                       + "  mscan <table> [start] [family[:qualifier[,qualifier]]/[family...]] [stop] [regexp]\n"
                       + "  cas <table> <key> <family> <qualifier> <expected> <value>\n"
                       + "Variants that acquire an explicit row-lock:\n"
