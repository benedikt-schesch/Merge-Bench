The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict in an area where both the `HEAD` and the branch identified by the commit hash `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` have introduced no explicit changes, as indicated by the absence of any code between the conflict markers.

This results in a **trivial conflict**, but without any actionable content for a semantic merge resolution. Since there are no additional lines in either version that could guide us on the intended functionality or behavioral change (i.e., one side may have intended to insert code, but it seems to have been removed or not pasted correctly in this snippet), the intent between the two versions is **indeterminate**.

As per the instruction, **when ambiguity exists in the intent or meaning of both branches' changes**, we should **keep the conflict markers and return the code as-is**.

Here is the code snippet, unmodified, with full context preserved as requested:
