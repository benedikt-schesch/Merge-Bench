The merge conflict involves two different approaches to accessing and mapping the `data` field from `rawPicture`. Both versions aim to achieve similar semantics—extracting JSON data and mapping it to a Java object—but they differ in the method used to access the data (`get` vs. `getJsonObject`) and the target class for mapping (`ProfilePictureSource` vs. `User.Picture`).

---

### Analysis

- **Method Call Difference**:
  - `rawPicture.get("data").toString()` implies that `rawPicture` is likely a `Map<String, Object>` or similar structure where `get` returns an arbitrary object, which is then converted to a string.
  - `rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString()` implies that `rawPicture` is a structured JSON object (e.g., `JsonObject`), and `getJsonObject` is a method to directly access a nested JSON object.

- **Class Mapping Difference**:
  - `ProfilePictureSource.class` and `User.Picture.class` are two different types. This suggests a possible refactoring or divergence in the data model between the two branches.

---

### Resolution Consideration

To resolve this conflict, we would need to know:
- The actual type of `rawPicture` (e.g., is it a `Map`, `JsonObject`, or another structure?)
- Which class (`ProfilePictureSource` or `User.Picture`) is the correct one to use in the current context.

Without this information, **the intent behind the changes is ambiguous**, and making a decision could lead to incorrect behavior or runtime errors.

### Final Output

As per the instructions, if the intent is ambiguous, the original snippet with the conflict should be returned unchanged.

    picture = null;
