The merge conflict arises between two valid approaches to asserting the content type of a `BinaryAttachment`. The `HEAD` uses `assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html")`, a fluent Hamcrest-style assertion employing a presumed custom matcher `.hasContentType(...)`. This may encapsulate richer semantics, like verifying not only value equivalence, but also the presence or derivation of the content type from the file extension.

The other side uses the more straightforward `assertEquals("text/html", att.getContentType())`, a commonly used assertion from JUnit that simply checks for string equality on the result of `getContentType()`. This is more imperative and explicit, relying less on external matchers or test helpers.

While both lines share the same **semantic intent**—validating that the content type is correctly inferred as `"text/html"`—the conflict becomes one of **test tooling style**, not logic.

However, **without further project-wide context** (such as whether the test file predominantly uses Hamcrest matchers or standard JUnit assertions), the **intent behind adopting one assertion style over the other is ambiguous**. Since the problem instructs that, in such ambiguous cases, the original merge conflict should be preserved, the correct resolution is to **return the snippet with the conflict markers intact**.

```java

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_html() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.html", attachmentData.getBytes());
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html");
=======
    assertEquals("text/html", att.getContentType());
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_fallback() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";

```
