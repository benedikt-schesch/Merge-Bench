To resolve the given merge conflict, we analyze the intent and semantics behind both versions of the conflicting code. The core intent in both cases is to ensure that `ScriptState` is not overwritten if it has already been initialized—typically by the `Main` class when Pig is started via the command line.

The conflict primarily involves a **comment** directly preceding the `if (ScriptState.get() == null)` check. One version (HEAD) includes a redundant comment:

```java
// ScriptState may have been initialized in Main. In that case, we
// should not overwrite it.
```

And the other version (likely a cleanup or refactoring commit) removes it, retaining only a **more precise** and contextual comment within the body of the `if` statement:

```java
// If Pig was started via command line, ScriptState should have been
// already initialized in Main. If so, we should not overwrite it.
```

Given that **functionally, both branches agree on the logic of the `if` statement** and that the **inner comment is more descriptive and contextually relevant**, the intent is better expressed **within the `if` statement itself**, making the outer comment redundant and unnecessary.

Therefore, the redundant comment above the `if` block should be **removed**, keeping the logic and remaining comments intact as seen in the commit `2125666`.

✅ **Resolution rationale**:
- Intent: Avoid overriding `ScriptState` if it was already initialized.
- Semantics: Both versions aim to achieve the same result.
- Style/Maintainability: Redundant comments reduce code clarity.

The resolved snippet with the merge conflict addressed is as follows (note: whitespace and context are preserved as required):

```java

        addJarsFromProperties();
        markPredeployedJarsFromProperties();

        PigStats.start(pigContext.getExecutionEngine().instantiatePigStats());

        if (ScriptState.get() == null) {
            // If Pig was started via command line, ScriptState should have been
            // already initialized in Main. If so, we should not overwrite it.
            ScriptState.start(pigContext.getExecutionEngine().instantiateScriptState());
        }

```
