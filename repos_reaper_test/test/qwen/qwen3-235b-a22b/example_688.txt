The merge conflict in the provided code snippet involves the addition of two import statements (`import java.net.URI;` and `import java.util.Map;`) in the `HEAD` version, while the incoming branch referenced by `1fc925c0741b0f6d64564077e1ac747e1c0b6407` does not include these changes. 

Since the code snippet does not provide any usage of `URI` or `Map`, and no further context is available to determine whether these imports are semantically required or not, the intent behind the merge conflict remains ambiguous.

As per the instructions, when the intent is unclear or cannot be determined from the context, the conflict should be preserved without resolution.
