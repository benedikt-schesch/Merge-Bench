The merge conflict in the provided code snippet arises from a disagreement on how to handle the assignment or collection of the `argument` when the port has a value range.

The original code snippet uses `arguments[i] = argument;` after evaluating which `argument` to use. This line strongly implies that `arguments` is an array or similar indexed data structure. Therefore, the correct operation inside the `else if (port.hasValueRange())` block should be an assignment to `argument`, which will then be added to the array via its index, not a direct call to `.add()` which implies a `List`.

Evaluating both sides of the conflict:

- The `HEAD` version tries to invoke `arguments.add(getPortValue(node, port));`, which would only work if `arguments` is a `List`. However, the rest of the code uses array indexing (`arguments[i] = argument;`), which contradicts this assumption.
- The `beb80fe54061a2939231a7473523e17d76be3029` version assigns `argument = getPortValue(port);` (assuming `getPortValue(port)` matches the intended usage), which seamlessly fits into the overall logic since the result will be assigned to `arguments[i]` in the next line.

Thus, based on semantics and intent, the resolution should keep the logic that aligns with array-style assignment through the variable `argument` and index `i`, making the `beb80fe54061a2939231a7473523e17d76be3029` version correct.

Here is the resolved code snippet with full context preserved and only the conflict resolved:

```java
        for (Port port : inputs) {
            Object argument;
            if (argumentMap.containsKey(port)) {
                argument = argumentMap.get(port);
            } else if (port.hasValueRange()) {
                argument = getPortValue(port);
            } else {
                // The port expects a list but nothing is connected. Evaluate with an empty list.
                argument = ImmutableList.of();
            }
            arguments[i] = argument;
```
