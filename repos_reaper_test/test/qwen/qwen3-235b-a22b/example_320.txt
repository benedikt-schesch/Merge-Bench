Here is the resolved code snippet with the conflict properly addressed, preserving the original context and structure:

```java
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new ResponseException(e.getMessage(), e);
                }
            }
        }
        if(TwitterApplication.DEBUG){
        	DebugTimer.betweenEnd("AS STRING");
        }
        return str;
    }

    public JSONObject asJSONObject() throws ResponseException {
        try {
```

### ðŸ’¡ **Resolution Analysis**
- **Intent of `HEAD`:** The original version directly returns `str` without any debug statements.
- **Intent of remote commit (`cbb20c8`):** Adds a conditional debug statement that activates only when `TwitterApplication.DEBUG` is `true`, which is used for profiling/tracing execution flow.
- **Semantic intent:** The remote change introduces diagnostic capability for debugging without altering core behavior. This is safe to adopt because it does not conflict with returning `str`.

Thus, the merged result includes the diagnostic logic and maintains the original control flow â€” incorporating a safe, non-breaking improvement to visibility in debug mode.
