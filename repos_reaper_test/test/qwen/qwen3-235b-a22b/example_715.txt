The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict in the `seekTo` method, and upon closer inspection, the conflict is not merely stylistic but semantic in nature.

---

### Analysis of the Conflict

The two versions of the method differ in how they obtain and use the `MediaPlayer` instance:

- **HEAD version**:
  ```java
  MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
  if (sMediaPlayer != null)
      sMediaPlayer.seekTo((int)msec);
  ```
  This version retrieves a `MediaPlayer` instance from a map (`mMediaPlayers`) using a key (`mPreparedQuery`). It then checks if the retrieved instance is not null before calling `seekTo`.

- **Other branch version**:
  ```java
  if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
      sMediaPlayer.seekTo((int) msec);
  }
  ```
  This version assumes that `sMediaPlayer` is already in scope and does not retrieve it from a map. This implies that `sMediaPlayer` is likely a class-level variable or declared elsewhere in the method.

---

### Semantic Implication

The key difference lies in **which `MediaPlayer` instance is being used**:

- The HEAD version uses a `MediaPlayer` associated with a specific query (`mPreparedQuery`), which suggests a more dynamic or context-aware approach.
- The other branch assumes a pre-existing `sMediaPlayer` variable, which may represent a different design or state management strategy.

These are **semantically different** approaches. Merging them without understanding the broader context of the codebase or the intended behavior would risk introducing logic errors.

---

### Conclusion

Since the intent behind the two versions is not clearly aligned and the semantic difference is significant (i.e., using different `MediaPlayer` instances), it is **not safe to resolve this conflict automatically**.
