Heres the full resolved conflict with preserved context and spacing:

```java
        sLicenses.clear();
        registerLicense(new ApacheSoftwareLicense20());
        registerLicense(new BSD3ClauseLicense());
        registerLicense(new ISCLicense());
        registerLicense(new MITLicense());
        registerLicense(new GnuLesserGeneralPublicLicense21());
        registerLicense(new CreativeCommonsAttributionNoDerivs30Unported());
    }

    /**
     * Register an additional license.
     *
```

Resolution rationale:
Both changes represent valid independent additions of new license types. Since the licenses are being registered in a collection and no conflicting implementation details exist, preserving both additions maintains the complete feature set from both branches while maintaining the method's intent to populate the license registry.
