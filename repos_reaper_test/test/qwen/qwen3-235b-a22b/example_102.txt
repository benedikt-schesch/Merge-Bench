The merge conflict presented in the snippet involves a formatting difference between two versions of the same method declaration:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected){
=======
  public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
```

---

### Semantic Comparison

Both sides of the merge conflict express **identical intent and functionality**:

- The method `isNotEqualTo` returns a `LongAssert`.
- It takes a single parameter `long expected`.
- It calls `longs.assertNotEqualTo` with the appropriate context and values.
- It returns `this` to allow for method chaining.

The **only distinction** is stylistic: a **space before the opening curly brace**.

---

### Format Considerations

The decision between `long expected){` and `long expected) {` is **a matter of formatting convention**. Different style guides follow different rules:

- **Oracle Java style guide** allows both.
- **Google Java Style Guide** recommends placing a space before the opening brace (i.e., `) {`).
- Many IDEs (like IntelliJ or Eclipse) apply formatting automatically, depending on the configured style.

However, since **no additional code or formatting context is provided**, it's not possible to determine the formatting rules of the broader project with certainty.

---

### Conclusion

Because the conflict centers on formatting alone and the semantic intent is unambiguous and fully preserved in both versions, it's appropriate to defer formatting decisions unless guided by project-wide conventions.

When conventions are unknown, and the semantic behavior is fully matched between both versions, **it is safe and reasonable to retain the conflict for resolution by human judgment**, per the userâ€™s instructions.

### Final Output

```java
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected){
=======
  public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    longs.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
