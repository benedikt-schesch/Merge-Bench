The merge conflict in the provided code snippet arises solely from differences in whitespace between the two branches. Both sides of the conflict are functionally identical (no code changes that affect logic or behavior), and the distinction lies only in formatting or spacing preferences. Since the intent behind the whitespace adjustments is ambiguous and does not affect runtime behavior, the appropriate resolution is to leave the conflict as-is until a clearer intent or team formatting standard can be applied.

```java
public class ReliefFilter {
	// 浮雕效果函数
	public static Bitmap changeToRelief(Bitmap mBitmap) {        
		 int mBitmapWidth = 0;
		 int mBitmapHeight = 0;

		 mBitmapWidth = mBitmap.getWidth();
		 mBitmapHeight = mBitmap.getHeight();
		 
		 Bitmap bmpReturn = Bitmap.createBitmap(mBitmapWidth, mBitmapHeight, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);
