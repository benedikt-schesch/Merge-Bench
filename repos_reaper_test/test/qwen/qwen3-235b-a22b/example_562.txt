The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict in the `checkV1_0` test method, where the test assertions differ syntactically and stylistically between two versions.

The `HEAD` section employs Hamcrest-style assertions with `assertThat`, while the merging branch uses JUnit's direct assertions like `assertEquals`, `assertNotNull`, and `assertTrue`.

From a **semantic standpoint**, both blocks of code test the **same conditions**:
- `con.getTotalCount()` should be `null`
- `con.getNextPageUrl()` should **not be `null`**
- `con.hasNext()` should be `true`

The differences between the two versions are **style-related** only and not semantically relevant to what is being tested. There is **no indication in the code or the context** about which assertion style is preferred in the codebase (e.g., the rest of the test suite's assertion framework usage is not visible here).

### Conclusion:

Given the ambiguity in intent and the lack of information about code style preferences, the correct approach is to **preserve the merge conflict markers** and return the code exactly as provided by the user, without resolving it. This ensures the conflict can be reviewed and resolved by someone with knowledge of the broader project style or history.

Here is the full snippet, returned unchanged as instructed:

```java

  @Test
  public void checkV1_0() {
    Connection<User> con = new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST),
      jsonFromClasspath("v1_0/connection-user-friends"), User.class);
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertThat(con.getTotalCount()).isNull();
    assertThat(con.getNextPageUrl()).isNotNull();
    assertThat(con.hasNext()).isTrue();
=======
    assertEquals(null, con.getTotalCount());
    assertNotNull(con.getNextPageUrl());
    assertTrue(con.hasNext());
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  }

  @Test
  public void checkV2_0() {
    Connection<User> con = new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST),
