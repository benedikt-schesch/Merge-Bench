The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict in the `focusOnField(final CreditEntryFieldBase field)` method. The two conflicting versions represent different semantic intentions:

- **HEAD** version:
  ```java
  if (this.textHelper != null) {
      this.textHelper.setText(field.getHelperText());
  }
  ```
  This version focuses on setting the helper text based on the field's current state, implying that the helper text is an important UI element tied directly to the field's focus.

- **Incoming branch** version:
  ```java
  focusOnField(field, null);
  ```
  This version delegates the logic to an overloaded method, suggesting a refactoring or abstraction of focus behavior, possibly to allow for more flexible initialization (e.g., with an optional `initialFieldValue`).

---

The conflict arises because both versions are modifying the same method body, and the intent behind the second version (calling the overload) does not clearly indicate that it replaces or preserves the helper text logic. The overloaded method `focusOnField(final CreditEntryFieldBase field, String initialFieldValue)` does not, in the provided context, include any logic to handle the helper text. Therefore, it is ambiguous whether the helper text logic should be preserved or removed.

---

Since the intent is not clearly aligned between the two versions and the semantics of the helper text handling are not evident in the overloaded method, it is safest to **preserve the original conflict markers** to avoid unintentional loss of functionality or logic.

Here is the full snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
        securityCodeText.setOnFocusChangeListener(l);
        zipCodeText.setOnFocusChangeListener(l);
    }

    public void focusOnField(final CreditEntryFieldBase field) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        if (this.textHelper != null) {
            this.textHelper.setText(field.getHelperText());
        }
=======
        focusOnField(field, null);
    }
