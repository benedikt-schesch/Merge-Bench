The merge conflict in the given code snippet involves a discrepancy in import statements for the `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` constant.

One branch (`HEAD`) introduces a **static import**:
```
import static org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType.MAPREDUCE;
```

The other branch introduces a standard import of the `ExecType` class:
```
import org.apache.pig.ExecType;
```

At first glance, these seem to be trying to resolve imports for the same type or constant but through two different mechanisms.

To assess:
- The **static import** is typically used to directly use constants (like `MAPREDUCE`) without qualifying with their enclosing enum or class (`ExecType.MAPREDUCE`).
- The **standard import** brings in the entire type `ExecType`, which is presumably an enum or class containing `MAPREDUCE`.

However, this introduces an ambiguity: do these imports refer to two different types with the same name, or is one simply a refactoring of the other?

Further, the `PigServer` is being imported directly afterward, suggesting the `ExecType` may indeed be a nested enum in `PigServer`, making the static import from `PigServer.ExecType.MAPREDUCE` correct. On the other hand, if `ExecType` has been moved to become a top-level class, then `import org.apache.pig.ExecType` would be necessary.

Without more context â€” such as:
- The full class implementation that might reference either `MAPREDUCE` or `ExecType`
- The package and file structure showing whether `ExecType` is a nested class or top-level class

...we cannot conclusively determine which import statement better fits the semantic intent.

### Therefore, the intent is ambiguous and cannot be resolved solely from the given snippet.
