The code snippet with the unresolved merge conflict is returned as-is, preserving all context and spacing exactly as provided. The semantic intent of both conflicting changes cannot be confidently resolved without additional context about the roles of `myKey` and `keyWritable` in the dataflow or lifecycle of the enclosing logic.

```java
