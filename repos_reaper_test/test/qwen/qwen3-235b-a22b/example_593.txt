The merge conflict involves two different method invocations (`add` vs `put`) for adding key-value pairs into a JSON object, along with corresponding catch blocks (`ParseException` vs `JsonException`). Both changes share a near-identical high-level intent: to trim and add the entry's key and value to a JSON object and to handle exceptions that could be thrown due to malformed or invalid input, while throwing a wrapped `IllegalArgumentException` on failure.

### Semantic Analysis
- `add(trimToEmpty(entry.getKey()), trimToEmpty(entry.getValue()))` implies the use of a method that may not be standard in well-known JSON libraries (like `org.json.JSONObject`), where the standard method is `put(...)`.
- `put(trimToEmpty(entry.getKey()), trimToEmpty(entry.getValue()))` adheres more closely to widespread patterns found in JSON libraries like `org.json`, `com.alibaba.fastjson`, or similar.
- The exception changes from `ParseException` to `JsonException`. These could originate from different libraries or represent evolutionary changes (e.g., a codebase moved off a deprecated exception to a library-specific construct). Their meaning, however, appears semantically identical in this code path—indicating a JSON transformation failure due to malformed or invalid inputs.

Given the semantics, the **intent on both sides** is about safely constructing JSON from key-value queries, trimming the values as necessary, and treating unexpected parsing issues as an `IllegalArgumentException` accompanied by context about the input queries.

**However**, it's impossible to fully resolve this conflict definitively **without knowledge of the JSON library** being used. Combining `put(...)` and `JsonException` aligns the method and its exception correctly, consistent with major JSON libraries in Java ecosystems.

### Resolution Decision
Applying **semantic alignment**—method and exception type should correctly represent the JSON library being used—resolving in favor of the merged branch's logic (`put(...)` and `JsonException`) yields a coherent and semantically consistent code block within the known constraints.

```java
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
          "Provided queries must have non-blank keys and values. You provided: " + queries);
      }

      try {
        jsonObject.put(trimToEmpty(entry.getKey()), trimToEmpty(entry.getValue()));
      } catch (JsonException e) {
        // Shouldn't happen unless bizarre input is provided
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unable to convert " + queries + " to JSON.", e);
      }
    }
```
