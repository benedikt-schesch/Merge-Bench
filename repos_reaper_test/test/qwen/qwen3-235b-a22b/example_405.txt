The merge conflict involves two alternative implementations that achieve the same semantic intent: retrieving the current player's display name either through a static utility method or via an instance method on the `getGC()` object. Both versions are structurally different but functionally equivalent, assuming both can compile and execute in the target codebase.

Since the resolution requires knowledge about which Google Play Games API version or custom `getGC()` implementation is used, which is not available, and the semantic equivalence of retrieving the player name is valid in both cases, it is not possible to conclusively determine which path to prefer without breaking the logic or violating established style and design patterns in the codebase.

Therefore, per the guidelines, if the conflict cannot be resolved confidently due to ambiguous intent or insufficient context, the conflict must be preserved.

Here is the original code snippet with the merge conflict retained exactly as given:

```java
		// change for example), then the fragment's onCreate is called before
		// the new GamesClient is setup. In this case, just use the player name
		// saved in the savedInstanceState bundle
		if ((savedInstanceState == null && ((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC().isConnected())
				|| (savedInstanceState != null && savedInstanceState.containsKey("player"))) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
			account.setSummary(getString(R.string.signed_in, savedInstanceState == null ? Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer(((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC())
					.getDisplayName() : savedInstanceState.getString("player")));
=======
			account.setSummary(getString(
					R.string.signed_in,
					savedInstanceState == null ? ((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC()
							.getCurrentPlayer().getDisplayName() : savedInstanceState
							.getString("player")));

		}

		final SharedPreferences prefs = getActivity().getSharedPreferences("pedometer",
				Context.MODE_MULTI_PROCESS);
