The intent of both sides of the merge conflict appears to be the addition of relevant imports from different Apache Pig packages. The line from `HEAD` adds an import for `FileLocalizer` from `org.apache.pig.impl.io`, whereas the other branch adds an import for `PigImplConstants` from `org.apache.pig.impl`.

Both imports appear to be from closely related packages and likely pertain to the same functional domain. However, without access to the actual implementation details that follow these imports, it is ambiguous whether either or both imports are actually required by the code.

---

Given that the intent is unclear and that the semantic requirement for either or both imports cannot be verified, the correct action is to preserve the conflict as-is. This ensures that the developer, who would have greater context about usage requirements, can make the final decision.
