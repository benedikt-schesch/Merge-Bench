The merge conflict arises from a difference in the intended value for `JVM_STARTUP_WAIT_TIME_MS`. Both versions aim to define a reasonable timeout period for waiting on the JVM during test execution:

- **HEAD (5_000 ms):** This is a more conservative value. It allows ample time for the JVM to initialize and could help avoid intermittent test failures on slower systems or CI environments.

- **67b612c (2_000 ms):** This is a more optimized value that likely reflects faster runtime environments or recognition that 5 seconds was excessive, potentially improving test run duration without sacrificing reliability.

---

### Resolution Decision

The intent behind each value appears to be semantic alignment with test execution constraints:

- `5000 ms` implies a focus on **test reliability** across different execution environments.
- `2000 ms` implies a focus on **test efficiency and performance**.

Since **no additional context or rationale** exists (e.g., test comments explaining environment assumptions), and both durations could reasonably achieve the shared objective (`ensure the JVM is ready during test startup`), the **intent remains ambiguous**.
