The merge conflict involves differing integer values for `nodeCount` and `relCount` in a test method. The intent behind these values appears to be defining expected counts for a test scenario, likely tied to specific logic in the `testRebuildCommand` method. Both versions of the values are semantically valid in context, but there is insufficient information to determine which values (or a potential new set of values) would correctly align with the merged codebase. The ambiguity in which branch reflects the correct or intended test expectations prevents confident resolution without further context.

```java
	@Test
	public void testRebuildCommand() {

		final Console console = new Console(securityContext, ConsoleMode.JavaScript, Collections.emptyMap());
