Based on the merge conflict provided, I'll resolve it by including both sets of imports since they seem to serve different purposes:

```java
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.resource.DefaultResourceClass;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.resource.DefaultResourceMethod;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.resource.ResourceClass;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.resource.ResourceMethod;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.serialization.gson.adapters.CalendarDeserializer;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.util.ISO8601Util;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.view.GenericController;

import com.google.gson.JsonDeserializationContext;
import com.google.gson.JsonDeserializer;
import com.google.gson.JsonElement;
import com.google.gson.JsonParseException;
```

The resolution includes both the `ISO8601Util` import (for date/time formatting) and the `GenericController` import (for controller functionality) since these appear to be independent changes that can coexist in the same class. The rest of the imports are unchanged as there were no conflicts there.
