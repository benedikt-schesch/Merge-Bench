The merge conflict involves the addition of `import org.junit.Before;`. The intent of the branch introducing this import is to ensure compilation if `@Before` is used in test setup. Since JUnit test classes commonly use `@Before` for initialization and the presence of `JenkinsRule` and `TemporaryFolder` does not preclude its use, the import should be included to align with the branch's intent and avoid compilation errors. The resolution preserves both sides' context and reflects the likely semantic need.
