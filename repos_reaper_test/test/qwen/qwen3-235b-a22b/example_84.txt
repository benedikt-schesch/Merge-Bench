The merge conflict arises between two attempts to initialize a list based on the size of a `JSONArray`. Both `size()` and `length()` are methods that could return the number of elements in `textParts`, depending on the specific implementation of the `JSONArray` being used.

- One version uses `size()`, which is typically used with `Collection`-based APIs in Java.
- The other uses `length()`, which is commonly used by `org.json.JSONArray`.

Since `JSONArray` is not part of the standard Java library and varies depending on its implementation, and the correct method (`size()` or `length()`) is not confirmable from the given snippet, the intent of both sides is ambiguous.

Per the instructions, when ambiguity prevents a resolution with certainty, the snippet should be returned with the conflict intact to avoid introducing a logic error.

```java
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml11(text);

  public static String formatWhiteCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // The white cards should only ever have one element in text, but let's be safe.

        // skip blank segments
