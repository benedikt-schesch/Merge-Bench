The merge conflict in the provided code snippet arises from a trivial difference in whitespace formatting around the assignment operator (`=`) in the declaration of the `inpLimitLists` variable. Both versions of the line are functionally identical in terms of semantics and intent: they both assign the result of deserializing the configuration value `"pig.inpLimits"` to the variable `inpLimitLists`.

---

### Semantic Analysis

- **Intent**: Both branches aim to initialize `inpLimitLists` with the result of deserializing a configuration value.
- **Functionality**: The actual logic and data flow are identical in both versions.
- **Formatting**: The only difference is the presence of a space after the `=` in the second version. In Java, this is a stylistic choice and does not affect the program's behavior.

---

### Contextual Formatting

Looking at the surrounding code:

```java
InputFormat inputFormat = loadFunc.getInputFormat();
```

This line uses spaces on both sides of the `=` operator, which is a common and readable Java style. The version from the other branch (`List<Long> inpLimitLists = `) aligns with this formatting convention, as it also includes a space after the `=`.

---

### Resolution

Given that:
- The semantic intent is unambiguous and identical in both versions,
- The formatting in the second version matches the surrounding code's style,

The conflict can be safely resolved by selecting the version from the other branch.

---

### Final Resolved Snippet

```java
        // for backward compatibility
        PigInputFormat.sJob = conf;

        InputFormat inputFormat = loadFunc.getInputFormat();

        List<Long> inpLimitLists = 
                (ArrayList<Long>)ObjectSerializer.deserialize(
                        conf.get("pig.inpLimits"));

        return new PigRecordReader(inputFormat, pigSplit, loadFunc, context, inpLimitLists.get(pigSplit.getInputIndex()));
    }
```
