The merge conflict involves a semantic difference in how the code checks if the application is running as a native GraalVM image. Both versions of the code aim to determine whether to append `"-graalvm"` to the version string when the application is running as a GraalVM native image.

### Conflict Analysis

1. **HEAD (Current branch version):**
   ```java
   String imageCode = System.getProperty("org.graalvm.nativeimage.imagecode");
   if (imageCode != null && imageCode.equals("runtime")){
   ```
   This approach directly uses string literals both for the system property key and the expected image code value. It is less maintainable and error-prone.

2. **Incoming branch (2a9778c6):**
   ```java
   String imageCode = System.getProperty(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY);
   if (imageCode != null && imageCode.equals(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME)) {
   ```
   This version correctly abstracts the string literals into constants (`PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY`, `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME`). This is a better practice for consistency and reducing duplication, suggesting that the constants are presumably defined elsewhere in the codebase.

---

### Semantic Resolution

Given the intent of both changes is to ensure a correct version string with the GraalVM identifier, the version on the incoming branch represents a *semantic improvement* through the use of constants. This is acceptable if those constants are defined somewhere in scope, which is a reasonable assumption given the pull from the other branch.

Thus, the use of constants logically represents a clean maintenance upgrade over hard-coded strings.

### Final Resolved Snippet

````java
    }

    public String toString() {
      // When running the application as a native image, append `-graalvm` to the
      // version.
      String imageCode = System.getProperty(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY);
      if (imageCode != null && imageCode.equals(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME)) {
        String[] tokens = versionString.split(" ");
        if (tokens.length > 0 && tokens[0].startsWith("gl-java")) {
          tokens[0] += "-graalvm";
          return Joiner.on(" ").join(tokens);
        }
