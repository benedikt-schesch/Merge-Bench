The merge conflict arises between two changes to the `Subscription` class:

- The `HEAD` branch introduces a `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;` field. This is typically added to ensure serialization compatibility across different versions of a class that implements `Serializable` (either directly or through an ancestor).
  
- The `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` revision appears not to include any such field in this location, likely because either:
  - The class does not need to control serialization explicitly, or
  - The `AbstractFacebookType` superclass already provides a `serialVersionUID`, making this one redundant, or
  - Omission was intentional under project policy or cleanup.

### Semantic Consideration

The presence or absence of `serialVersionUID` affects serialization behavior. However, without additional context—such as whether the class is actually serialized, what policy governs `serialVersionUID` usage, or how the superclass handles it—the intent behind one change versus the other is ambiguous.

Since both changes potentially serve a valid semantic purpose (safeguarding against accidental version mismatch vs. minimizing redundant code), and the resolution depends on external project conventions or requirements, it is safer to **not resolve** the conflict automatically.
