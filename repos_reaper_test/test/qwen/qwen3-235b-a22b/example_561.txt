The merge conflict involves two variations of asserting equality:

- `assertThat(...).isEqualTo(...)` (from AssertJ)
- `assertEquals(..., ...` (from JUnit)

Both variations semantically express the same intention: asserting that two values are equal. However, **the choice of the assertion framework depends on the codebase conventions**, which are unknown from this snippet alone.

Given the ambiguity around which assertion style (`JUnit` or `AssertJ`) is preferred in this file or project, and per instructions stating that conflicts should remain unresolved if intent is ambiguous, the appropriate response is to **return the snippet as-is with the conflict markers retained**.

Here is the code with no modifications:

```java
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_withCursor() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = createCursorConnection();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertThat(connection.getAfterCursor()).isEqualTo("NzU1MjI1MjU0");
    assertThat(connection.getBeforeCursor()).isEqualTo("MTY1MTAyNjUxNg==");
=======
    assertEquals("NzU1MjI1MjU0", connection.getAfterCursor());
    assertEquals("MTY1MTAyNjUxNg==", connection.getBeforeCursor());
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  }

  private Connection<FacebookType> createCursorConnection() {
    FakeWebRequestor fakeWebRequestor = new FakeWebRequestor() {
      @Override
