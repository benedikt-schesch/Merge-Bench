The provided merge conflict occurs around a single import statement. On one side (HEAD), the line `import org.restlet.ext.apispark.internal.introspection.util.Types;` has been added, whereas the other branch does not contain any change in that location, as indicated by the empty space between the merge conflict markers.

---

### Analysis

This represents a potential conflict between the following two possibilities:

- The `HEAD` branch added this import to support a dependency introduced in its changes, suggesting the `Types` utility is now required in the code that follows.
- The other branch either did not include or perhaps explicitly removed this line, suggesting a different dependency state is assumed or it's no longer necessary.

Since the snippet only includes the imports and not the full file contents, the actual usage of the `Types` class is **not visible** in this context. Therefore, we cannot determine definitively whether the import is still required or has become obsolete.

---

### Resolution Decision

Given the **uncertainty of semantic intent**—especially when considering whether the `Types` class is used later in the code or whether it's safe to remove the import without introducing a compilation error—the most appropriate course of action is to **retain the original conflict**, as per the instructions for ambiguous merges.
