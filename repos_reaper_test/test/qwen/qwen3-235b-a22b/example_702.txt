The merge conflict in the import section involves the addition of `android.content.res.Resources` and `android.graphics.Color` in `HEAD` and their absence in the other branch (`5b113d18`). Since the actual code that uses these imports is not provided, it is impossible to determine whether these imports are semantically required in the merged version.

Both branches may have valid reasons for their changes:
- `HEAD` added the imports, suggesting that the code may depend on `Resources` and `Color`.
- The other branch removed them, possibly because they are no longer needed in that version.

Without further context or code usage, the intent behind either change is ambiguous. Therefore, the conflict should not be resolved automatically and must be reviewed manually.
