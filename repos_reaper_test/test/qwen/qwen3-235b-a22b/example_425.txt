The merge conflict lies in two aspects: the parameters passed to the `LazyLoadingModel` constructor and the handling of checked exceptions in the `try/catch` block.

In one version of the code (`HEAD`), an additional `config` argument is provided to the `LazyLoadingModel`, which implies that `config` is required for the model's operation or lazy evaluation logic. However, the other version omits `config`, assuming it's either no longer necessary or has already been resolved from the surrounding context.

Regarding exception handling: the `HEAD` version separates the exception handling for `IOException` and `TemplateException`, which could be intentional if any distinct handling was originally done in the respective `catch` blocks (though the snippet only indicates that both rethrow as a `RenderingException`). In contrast, the second version uses Java's multiple exception catch block (`IOException | TemplateException`) for brevity and conciseness, which assumes both exceptions should be handled identically.

---

**Semantic ambiguity:**

- The inclusion or exclusion of `config` depends on whether `LazyLoadingModel` requires it in its constructor at this point in code evolution. If one side removed or added it without updating the code, either change may result in bugs or compilation errors.
- The exception-handling differences do not reflect semantic changes in behavior, only style differences.

Since no further clarity exists on the constructor's actual expected signature or on any semantic change in exception handling logic, and given the potential risk of silently favoring one version over the other when resolving the constructor invocation, the **intent remains ambiguous**.

Thus, to preserve correctness and defer resolution to the developers with full context, the conflict remains unresolved in the snippet below:

    @Override
    public void renderDocument(final TemplateModel model, final String templateName, final Writer writer) throws RenderingException {
        try {
            Template template = templateCfg.getTemplate(templateName);
<<<<<<< HEAD
            template.process(new LazyLoadingModel(templateCfg.getObjectWrapper(), model, db, config), writer);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RenderingException(e);
        } catch (TemplateException e) {

            template.process(new LazyLoadingModel(templateCfg.getObjectWrapper(), model, db), writer);
        } catch (IOException | TemplateException e) {
