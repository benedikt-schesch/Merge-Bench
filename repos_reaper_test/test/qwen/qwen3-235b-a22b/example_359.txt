The merge conflict in the provided snippet involves two conflicting branches that both aim to insert the exact same block of documentation text related to parameter mapping behavior when the input data is a `Map`. Despite the identical semantic content between `HEAD` and the other branch, the difference appears to be whether the `<p>` tag is properly closed with `</p>`.

### Analysis

- **HEAD version** includes the full paragraph wrapped in proper HTML markup (`<p>` and `</p>`).
- **Other branch** includes the same paragraph content but omits the closing `</p>`.

This discrepancy creates a conflict, even though the **intent** is clearly the sameâ€”namely, to document how input parameters without a declared field are stored in a map, either as a simple `String` or as a `List<String>` if the parameter occurs multiple times.

From an XML/HTML standpoint, omitting the closing `</p>` is syntactically and semantically less ideal than including it. Therefore, the correct resolution, both stylistically and structurally, is to retain the properly formatted version from `HEAD` that includes both opening and closing `<p>` tags.

### Final Resolution

Below is the full code snippet with the conflict resolved as described, while **preserving all surrounding context exactly as it was**, and only modifying the conflict section to reflect an accurate and properly structured merge outcome.

```java
   * parameter is the declared field class. Declared fields of type {@link Collection} are used to
   * support repeating data key names, so each member of the collection is an additional data key
   * value. They are parsed the same as "primitive" fields, except that the generic type parameter
   * of the collection is used as the {@link Class} parameter.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
```
