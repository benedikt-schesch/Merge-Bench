The conflict occurs due to a trivial formatting difference in the `catch` statement. Both versions are functionally and semantically identical, differing only in the **presence of a space** between `catch` and the opening parenthesis `(`.

Java allows both forms — with or without the space — making this a matter of **style** rather than **functionality**. Since whitespace like this does not influence runtime behavior or code logic, and the intent (to catch any exception and handle fallback to Metal L&F) is preserved in both versions, the resolution should be made based on **code style consistency** within the codebase.

Assuming the project adheres to common Java formatting standards, where a **space** appears between `catch` and the parameter declaration (i.e., `catch (Exception ex)`), the `HEAD` version is correct and should be retained.

Below is the resolved snippet with full context preserved as requested:

```java
	 */
	public static void createAndShowGUI() {
		Log.d(LOG_TAG, "set to system default LaF");
		try {
			UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
		} catch (Exception ex) {
			System.out.println("Cannot find system look and feel, setting to metal.");
		}
		Log.d(LOG_TAG, "createAndShowGUI");
		flingFrame = new FlingFrame();
		// change the default app icon; might not work for all platforms
```
