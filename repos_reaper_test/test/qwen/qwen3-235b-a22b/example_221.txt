The code snippet presents a merge conflict that arises from a syntactical formatting difference between two branches, with both aiming to achieve the exact same semantic outcome: closing the `else` block after calling the `fail()` method.

---

### Conflict Context

The conflicting lines are:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
        }
=======
        }  
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
```

Both versions simply close the `else` block that contains the `fail("Error: Unexpected Parse Tree output")` statement. The difference lies in formattingâ€”specifically, trailing whitespace or indentation variations in the closing brace.

---

### Semantic Intent

- The `else` clause serves to handle any case where `lo` is **not** an instance of `LOCogroup`.
- The intended behavior is to throw an exception or signal failure with a message in that case.
- Semantically, both branches perform exactly the same operation: closing the `else` block correctly after calling the `fail()` method.
- There are no logic differences or functional conflicts. This is a **formatting or whitespace-only conflict**.

---

### Resolution Decision

Since both branches agree on the semantics and structure:
- There's no ambiguity in intent.
- The `else` block must be closed.
- Any of the lines (either one with or without the trailing space) would suffice for the structure.

Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by selecting the closing brace from either branch and removing the merge markers. Given typical Java formatting conventions, the cleaner option without the extra space is preferred for maintainability and readability.

### Final Resolved Snippet (Including Full Context)

```java
        
        if (lo instanceof LOCogroup) {
            assertTrue(((LOCogroup) lo).getRequestedParallelism() == 16);
        } else {
            fail("Error: Unexpected Parse Tree output");
        }
    }
    
    
    
    
```

This snippet preserves the correct code structure and formatting, resolves the conflict in a way that reflects the shared semantic intent, and removes unnecessary merge control symbols.
