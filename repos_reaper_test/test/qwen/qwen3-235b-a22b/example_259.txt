The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict in the import statements for `LitePackager` and `Packager`. Both classes reside in the same package, suggesting they may serve similar or related purposes. However, without visibility into the rest of the codebase or the specific usage of these classes, it is not possible to determine which import (or both) is semantically correct.

In semantic merge conflict resolution, the goal is to preserve the intent of both changes when possible. However, when the intent is ambiguous or the usage context is missing, it is safer to leave the conflict unresolved to avoid introducing errors.

Thus, the correct action is to return the snippet with the conflict markers intact, as instructed.
