The merge conflict presented occurs in a Java file where two branches have introduced incompatible changes to the import statements. Specifically, the `HEAD` branch adds imports related to `Learner`, `TopologyBuilder`, and `Stream` from `org.apache.samoa` (via `com.yahoo.labs.samoa`), likely indicating functionality related to topologies and learners within the SAMOA framework.

On the contrast, the branch `40d31d6...` appears to remove those specific imports and instead introduces libraries related to configurability and parsing (`ClassOption`, `Configurable`, `IntOption`), which might be used for handling CLI or configuration-driven behavior in the same module. Additionally, it retains some basic SAMOA imports like `Instances` and adds `Processor` from `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.core`.

### Semantic Consideration

The `Learner`, `TopologyBuilder`, and `Stream` imports suggest a topology-based learning or execution mechanism, possibly used in a streaming or distributed learning setup. Meanwhile, `Processor`, `ClassOption`, and `Configurable` suggest that the class may be transitioning toward more modular configuration handling or simplifying dependencies by moving away from topology-specific constructs.

The intent of the two changes is semantically unclearly aligned:
- One side preserves or adds complex streaming/audio processing patterns.
- The other shifts toward configurability and perhaps modular processing, implying a refactoring or scope change.

The ambiguity lies in whether both sets of imports are necessary for the module, or whether one or the other side represents an intentional deprecation/restructuring of the system. Since the structure and usage are not visible from the code snippet, a correct semantic resolution cannot be made definitively.

### Resolution

As per the guiding instruction — if the semantic intent is ambiguous, return the code snippet **with the original conflict markers intact and unmodified**, preserving all surrounding context and formatting — we must leave the conflict unresolved.
