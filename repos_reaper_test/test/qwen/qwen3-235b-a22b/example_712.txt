In this case, I'm presented with a merge conflict in some Java code related to an authentication flow that also appears to refresh a user's collection data after updating tokens.

Looking at the conflict:
- The HEAD version has multiple explicit calls to CollectionManager to fetch specific data types: playlists, loved items, starred artists and albums.
- The other version of the code uses a single call to CollectionManager's fetchAll() method.

The code surrounding both sides of the conflict suggests the intent is to update authentication tokens and then refresh user data collections (like playlists and favorites). The HEAD version does this with multiple explicit calls while the other side uses what appears to be a more consolidated approach.

Without knowing the exact implementation of fetchAll() in CollectionManager, it's not definitively clear whether it achieves precisely the same result as the collection of explicit fetch calls. While it may be a more efficient way to express the same intent (refreshing all user collection data), there could be subtle differences in behavior or side effects that aren't apparent from this snippet.

Since I've been instructed to only resolve the conflict when the semantic intent is clearly the same from both sides, and to return the conflict if there's any ambiguity, I should return the snippet with the conflict markers intact.

Here is the exact snippet with the conflict as provided:

```java
                am.setUserData(account, MANDELLA_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATIONTIME_HATCHET,
                        String.valueOf(accessTokenExpiresIn));
                ensureAccessTokens();
            }
        }
<<<<<<< HEAD
        CollectionManager.getInstance().fetchPlaylists();
        CollectionManager.getInstance().fetchLovedItemsPlaylist();
        CollectionManager.getInstance().fetchStarredArtists();
        CollectionManager.getInstance().fetchStarredAlbums();
        InfoSystem.getInstance().resolve(getLoggedInUser());

                AuthenticatorManager.CONFIG_TEST_RESULT_TYPE_SUCCESS);
    }
```
