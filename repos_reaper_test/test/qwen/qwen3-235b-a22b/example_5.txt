The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict related to the implementation logic under a shared version check. Below is the full context and the conflict marker preserved exactly as it appears in the snippet, without modification, due to ambiguity in the intended behavior:

```java
            prefix = readString( buf );
            suffix = readString( buf );
            friendlyFire = buf.readByte();
            if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 )
            {
<<<<<<< HEAD
                nameTagVisibility = readString( buf );
                if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_9 )
                {
                    collisionRule = readString(buf);
                }
                color = buf.readByte();
