The provided merge conflict involves a single line of code within a comment block. Upon closer inspection, the difference between the two conflicting versions is purely stylistic: a single space after the hyphen (`-`).

### Analysis of Semantics

Both versions of the code express the same **intent**:

- To pass the input location to the loader using a cloned configuration.
- This is done to avoid modifications to the shared configuration object by different loaders, especially in a distributed execution context like Hadoop.

All other code lines around the conflict are **identical between both branches**, and the **style** of the remaining comments shows consistent spacing around hyphens, e.g.:

```java
// clone of the configuration we have - this is so that if the
```

Given this context, the version of the conflict line **with** the space:

```java
// first pass input location to the loader - for this send a 
```

follows the same formatting convention and is semantically equivalent.

### Resolution

Given the consistency in code formatting and no divergence in logic or meaning, the line with the space is preferred to maintain **style uniformity** within the comments. Since the intent from both sides of the merge aligns and the resolution is clear, we proceed accordingly.

### Resolved Snippet

```java
                // working dir to /user/<userid>
                if(!pigContext.getExecType().isLocal()) {
                    fs.setWorkingDirectory(jobcontext.getWorkingDirectory());
                }

                // first pass input location to the loader - for this send a 
                // clone of the configuration we have - this is so that if the
                // loader (or the inputformat of the loader) decide to store the
                // input location into the configuration (for example,
                // FileInputFormat stores this in mapred.input.dir in the conf),
                // then for different inputs, the loader's don't end up
