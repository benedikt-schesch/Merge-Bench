The provided merge conflict involves a divergence in import statements related to the `Quaternion` class. Specifically:

- The `HEAD` branch includes the import `import org.spout.math.imaginary.Quaternion;`.
- The other branch referenced by the commit `cc0703054530b4eeda07a2b1b619ed34e1e7d201` **removes** the import of `Quaternion`.
- There is no direct evidence in the provided code snippet (such as class body or usage) that confirms whether `Quaternion` is actually used in the code.

---

### Semantic Intent Analysis

When resolving merge conflicts, especially in semantic contexts, it's important to understand whether the change to the import stems from a need to include a necessary dependency or to clean up unused ones. Importantly:

- **HEAD retains** the import, implying the class still relies on `Quaternion`, or that the developer intended to keep it for future use.
- The other branch **removes** it, suggesting a possible refactor or determination that `Quaternion` is no longer used.

However, **the code snippet provided ends before the class body starts**, so **the usage or necessity of `Quaternion` cannot be determined from this information alone.**

---

### Conclusion

Based on the ambiguity of whether `Quaternion` is used within the class body, **the intent behind the changes is not semantically clear** or resolvable from the given context alone. Therefore, the correct approach according to your instructions is to **not resolve the conflict** and instead **return the exact snippet as received**, preserving both the code context and the conflict markers.
