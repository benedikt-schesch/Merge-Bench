The semantic intent of both versions appears to be maintaining a class for loading text data. The HEAD version maintains field spacing style while the incoming changes add a tuple factory for data processing. I've merged both intentions by incorporating the tuple factory field (a logical addition for data processing functionality) while preserving the original spacing style of the end field.
