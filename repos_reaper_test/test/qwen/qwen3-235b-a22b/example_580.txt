The merge conflict here involves a discrepancy in the data type of the `picture` field:

- One branch (`HEAD`) uses `ProfilePictureSource`, suggesting an intent to use a structured or enumerated type (perhaps for better semantics or control).
- The conflicting branch (`a17acec0`) declares the field as `String`, reverting to a plain string type.

There is also a related field `rawPicture` annotated with `@Facebook("picture")` of type `JsonObject`, implying that the JSON field "picture" is an object rather than a simple primitive type. This means the `picture` field could be intended as a derived or convenience value (like a URL or semantic enum) extracted or inferred from `rawPicture`.

Since both options represent two valid but semantically different interpretations of what the `picture` field should hold, and **there is not enough contextual evidence to definitively conclude** which branch aligns better with the long-term intent or correctness of the system (especially without understanding the full domain model or the data schema from the `@Facebook` source), it is safest to **preserve the conflict**.

This preserves the ambiguity and allows someone with extra domain knowledge to explicitly resolve it.
