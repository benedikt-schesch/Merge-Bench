The merge conflict is semantic and syntactic in nature, stemming from two equivalent yet slightly differently structured Java expressions that achieve the same goal: initializing a sorted set of playback speed strings (`FINITE_PLAYTIMES`). Both versions aim to construct a `TreeSet<String>` containing the same elements in the same order, differing only in the style of expression.

On one side:
```java
final Set<String> finitePlaytimes = new TreeSet<String>(Arrays.asList(
    new String[]{"0.25x", "0.5x", "0.75x", "1x", "1.25x", "1.5x", "1.75x", "2x", "2.5x", "3x", "4x", "5x", "10x"}));
```

On the other:
```java
final Set<String> finitePlaytimes = new TreeSet<>(Arrays.asList("0.25x", "0.5x", "0.75x", "1x", "1.25x", "1.5x", "1.75x", "2x", "2.5x", "3x", "4x", "5x", "10x"));
```

### Semantic Equivalence
Both versions are functionally identical:
- They use a `TreeSet` to maintain a sorted order.
- They use `Arrays.asList` to convert a list of strings into a list for the set.
- The data is identical: a list of playback speed strings.

### Style and Modern Java
The conflicting change (from `5adedd248128`) represents a more modern and concise style:
- It omits redundant type arguments thanks to Java's diamond operator `<>`.
- It uses varargs form for `Arrays.asList()`, which Java automatically interprets as an array, making the explicit `new String[] { ... }` unnecessary.

### Resolution Intent
The intent of both changes is clearly to populate the `FINITE_PLAYTIMES` set with the same values in the same order. The syntactic difference is non-functional and improving clarity and conciseness aligns with best practices. Thus, the conflict is resolvable without ambiguity.

### Resolved Snippet (without conflict markers)
Below is the full original context with the merge conflict resolved using the more modern and concise variant while preserving all surrounding code:

```java
  private final static int JUDGE_TIMEOUT_PER_CARD = 7 * 1000;
  private final static int MAX_SKIPS_BEFORE_KICK = 2;
  private final static Set<String> FINITE_PLAYTIMES;

  static {
    final Set<String> finitePlaytimes = new TreeSet<>(Arrays.asList("0.25x", "0.5x", "0.75x", "1x", "1.25x", "1.5x", "1.75x", "2x", "2.5x", "3x", "4x", "5x", "10x"));
    FINITE_PLAYTIMES = Collections.unmodifiableSet(finitePlaytimes);
  }

  private final int id;
  /**
```

This version maintains full functionality while presenting a modern, idiomatic Java expression.
