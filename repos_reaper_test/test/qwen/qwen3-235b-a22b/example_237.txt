Here is the resolved snippet preserving the context and semantics of both versions:

```java
	static public File createInputFile(String tmpFilenamePrefix, 
			                           String tmpFilenameSuffix, 
			                           String[] inputData) 
	throws IOException {
		File f = File.createTempFile(tmpFilenamePrefix, tmpFilenameSuffix);
		f.deleteOnExit();
		PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(f), "UTF-8"));
		for (int i=0; i<inputData.length; i++){
			pw.println(inputData[i]);
		}
		pw.close();
		return f;
```

**Resolution Explanation:**
1. Added `f.deleteOnExit()` from the conflicting version to ensure proper cleanup of temporary files
2. Used UTF-8 encoding (`OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(f), "UTF-8")`) to ensure consistent text encoding across platforms
3. Retained the file creation logic and data writing pattern from both versions
4. Preserved all original method structure and spacing exactly as provided
