The behavior of both test cases appears functionally similar, and the branch divergence appears to stem primarily from a method renaming decision (`testGroupReorderCount` vs `testSimpleCount`). Both branches then continue to implement similar logic using a temporary file and iteration over `nullFlags`. 

Given that the divergence is focused on the test name and not on the internal logic, and assuming both names potentially represent valid scoping intents (e.g., one for a simple case, another intended to support group reordering in the future), it is ambiguous which logic should be excluded or preserved in this merge resolution without further contextual clarity.

As such, and in accordance with instructions to fall back to unchanged conflict resolution in ambiguous semantic/intent cases, the original conflict is preserved below.

```java
        tmpFile.delete();
        
    }
    
    @Test
<<<<<<< HEAD
    public void testGroupReorderCount() throws Throwable {
=======
    public void testSimpleCount() throws Exception {
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
        for (int i = 0; i < nullFlags.length; i++) {
            System.err.println("Testing testSimpleCount with null flag:" + nullFlags[i]);
        
            PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(tmpFile));
```
