The merge conflict in the provided code snippet involves the import statements `java.util.Collection` and `java.util.HashMap`. The `HEAD` version introduces these imports, while the `d2c4b48a` version does not include them, leading to a conflict.

---

### Analysis of Intent

- **HEAD's Intent**: The addition of `java.util.Collection` and `java.util.HashMap` suggests that the code on this branch likely uses these classes. This could be due to new logic that requires collections or hash maps.
  
- **d2c4b48a's Intent**: The absence of these imports in the other branch could imply that the code in that branch no longer requires them, possibly due to refactoring or removal of related functionality.

---

### Ambiguity in Resolution

Without access to the actual code that follows these imports, it is not possible to definitively determine whether these imports are still required in the merged version. The resolution of this conflict depends on whether the merged codebase actually uses `Collection` or `HashMap`.

---

### Conclusion

Since the intent behind the removal in the `d2c4b48a` branch is unclear and the usage of these imports in the final merged code is unknown, the correct course of action is to **preserve the conflict markers** and return the snippet as-is. This ensures that the developer resolving the conflict can make an informed decision based on the actual code context.
