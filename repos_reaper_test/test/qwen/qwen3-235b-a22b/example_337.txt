The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict in the `onCreateOptionsMenu` method of an Android class, specifically around the addition of two menu items: one for "Mentions" and one for "Direct Messages." These items are created with icons and unique IDs, indicating that one side of the merge (the `HEAD`) intended for them to appear in the options menu.

---

However, in the other side of the merge (as inferred from the space between `=======` and the next line), there appears to be no code in the conflicting region. This suggests that the other side may have either deleted those lines or implemented a different feature in a non-overlapping part of the file.

Semantically, it is important to consider the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD version intent**: To add specific functionality to the menu—namely, the two items with icons.
- **Other branch intent**: Ambiguous, as the conflicting area is completely empty. This could mean that those menu items were intentionally removed, or that this section of the method was left untouched due to unrelated changes elsewhere in the file.

Because the meaning of the "other branch" version cannot be determined from the empty section and the broader implications of removing or retaining functionality are not explicitly stated, the intent of the merge remains **ambiguous**.

---

In such a situation, and in accordance with the guidelines, the best practice is to return the code snippet **with the conflict markers intact**, so that a human developer—possibly with more contextual awareness—can make a final decision on whether to retain, discard, or combine the added functionality.

Here is the code block, preserved exactly as provided, to reflect the unresolved merge conflict:

```java
	}

	// Menu.
	@Override
	public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		MenuItem item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_REPLIES, 0, R.string.page_title_mentions);
		item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_revert);

		item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_DM, 0, R.string.page_title_direct_messages);
		item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_send);

		return super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);
	}
	
	private int CONTEXT_DELETE_ID = getLastContextMenuId() + 1;
```
