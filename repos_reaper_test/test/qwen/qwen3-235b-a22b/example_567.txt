The merge conflict involves two valid yet stylistically different approaches to importing classes from `java.util`: explicitly listing individual classes versus using a wildcard (`*`). 

### Semantic Analysis:
- **HEAD (explicit imports):** This approach follows best practices for clarity and avoiding potential naming conflicts by listing each class used from `java.util`, such as `ArrayList`, `Arrays`, `Collections`, and `List`.
- **Branch (wildcard import):** This reflects a preference for brevity and may suggest that additional classes from `java.util` could be used within the file, or it may have been added during simplification of imports.

Java semantics do not favor one approach over the other; both compile correctly and functionally equivalent when the same classes are used. Since the code beyond this snippet isn't visible, we cannot verify if additional classes from `java.util` are used. Without that knowledge, either form may be appropriate depending on team style or policy.

### Resolution:
Since the semantic intent behind the two approaches is ambiguous and both are valid, the conflict is **not resolvable without further context**.
