The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict between two branches of development. The conflict lies in the initial assignment of `curKey` and the selection of the `getValueAsPigType()` source (`myKey` vs. `keyWritable`). While both sides proceed identically after this initialization and unwrapping logic, the difference in variable usage suggests a potentially critical distinction between the two branches.

---

### Semantic Intent Analysis:

- Both code branches attempt to **unwrap a `Tuple` key **(as described in the comment) when it has been wrapped by the `LocalRearrange` operator for jobs with differing key types.
- The **logic inside the conditional is identical**, implying that the intent is consistent across branches: *if the key is wrapped, extract the correct underlying type and use it as the current key, setting the appropriate index.*
- The **only difference is in variable selection**: `myKey` vs. `keyWritable`.

This suggests the following:
- **HEAD** uses `myKey`, implying that this variable was the previously accepted source for the map key.
- The `88ae4a5` branch introduces `keyWritable` in the same role, possibly reflecting a refactoring or change in scope that affects the variable used to hold the current key.

---

### Decision:

Given the ambiguity surrounding which variable (`myKey` or `keyWritable`) holds the correct key value at this point in the execution flow, and without broader context regarding variable definitions and usage patterns, **it is not possible to definitively resolve the conflict based on semantics alone**.

In such cases, and especially in environments where correctness is critical (e.g., Pig MapReduce workflows), **leaving the conflict unresolved ensures that developers can manually verify which branch's logic applies in this context**.

### Final Output:

```java
        Packager pkgr = packagers.get(index);

        // check to see if we need to unwrap the key. The keys may be
        // wrapped inside a tuple by LocalRearrange operator when jobs
        // with different map key types are merged
<<<<<<< HEAD
        PigNullableWritable curKey = myKey;
        if (!sameMapKeyType && !inCombiner && isKeyWrapped.get(index)) {
            Tuple tup = (Tuple)myKey.getValueAsPigType();
=======
        PigNullableWritable curKey = keyWritable;
        if (!sameMapKeyType && !inCombiner && isKeyWrapped.get(index)) {
            Tuple tup = (Tuple) keyWritable.getValueAsPigType();
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a
            curKey = HDataType.getWritableComparableTypes(tup.get(0),
                    pkgr.getKeyType());
            curKey.setIndex(origIndex);
        }
```
