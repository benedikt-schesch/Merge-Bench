The merge conflict occurs in a block of imported packages, where one branch (`HEAD`) includes the import for `CommonHandler`, while the other branch (`67bcb76a`) omits it. This suggests a potential divergence in functionality or dependencies intended by each branch.

Since the provided context does not reveal any usage details or changes to the logic that might justify the intent behind including or excluding `org.spout.api.protocol.CommonHandler`, the semantic intent remains ambiguous. Without information such as:

- whether `CommonHandler` is used in the class,
- whether usage was removed or refactored in the other branch,
- or whether it was accidentally omitted,

we cannot definitively determine the correct resolution.

As per the guidelines, when the intent is ambiguous, the snippet should be returned **with the original conflict markers intact**, without any modifications to the context or structure.
