The intent of both versions is to animate the view with the same properties (`alpha`, `scale`, `translationY`, `startDelay`, `duration`, and the setting of an `AnimatorListener`). The only difference lies in code formatting â€” whether the chained method calls are placed on a single line or split across multiple lines.

Given that the semantic meaning and behavior do not differ between the two branches, but the version in the `c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c` branch offers improved readability by placing each chained method call on its own line, it is reasonable to resolve the conflict by adopting that style.

Below is the **full snippet with the conflict resolved**, in the exact same context and with correct formatting preserved:

```java
            }

            @Override
            public void onAnimationEnd(Animator animator) {
                // Second step: fade out and scale and slide
                animate().alpha(0.0f).scaleY(0.7f).scaleX(0.7f).translationYBy(
                        -getHeight()*1.5f).setStartDelay(100).setDuration(
                        FADE_OUT_DURATION_MS).setListener(
                        new Animator.AnimatorListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onAnimationStart(Animator animator) {

                    }
```
