The merge conflict involves two different card types (`CustomBlackCard`/`CustomWhiteCard` vs. `CardcastBlackCard`/`CardcastWhiteCard`) in a class named `CustomDeck`. The intent behind the merge is ambiguous: the class name and package (`customsets`) suggest a preference for `Custom*` types, but the incoming branch (`cardcast`) introduces `Cardcast*` types. Without additional context about whether this class should represent custom decks, cardcast decks, or a unified implementation, the semantic resolution is unclear. The conflict markers are preserved as instructed.
