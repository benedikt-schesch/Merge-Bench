The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two versions of the `buildPlan` method. Specifically, the line initializing the `PigContext` is included in `HEAD`, but has been **deleted** in the branch being merged (i.e., as indicated by the empty region between `=======` and the closing `>>>>>>>` tag).

---

### Semantic Intent Consideration:

1. ** HEAD Branch (Local Initialization):**
   - The `PigContext` is being initialized as follows:
     ```java
     PigContext pigContext = new PigContext(ExecType.LOCAL, new Properties());
     ```
     followed by:
     ```java
     LogicalPlanBuilder builder = new LogicalPlanBuilder(pigContext);
     ```
   - This suggests the intent is to create a local `PigContext` directly within this method and use it to configure the `LogicalPlanBuilder`.

2. **Other Branch (Potential Deletion, Implied Change):**
   - The conflict region shows that this line was removed in the conflicting branch.
   - However, since the construction of `LogicalPlanBuilder(builder)` depends on `pigContext`, removing it here would result in a **compile error** or **NPE** unless `pigContext` is somehow initialized elsewhere (which is not evident in this snippet).

3. **Ambiguity Warning:**
   - Since the snippet does not provide any alternative initialization of `pigContext`, keeping the line from `HEAD` appears to be semantically correct and necessary for the code to compile and function properly.
   - Without further context from the other branch, the deletion seems incorrect or at least unintended in isolation.

However, per your directive:

> *If you are not sure on how to resolve the conflict or if the intent is ambiguous, please return the same snippet with the conflict.*

Given the ambiguity around **why** the other branch deleted this line and the potential that the initialization might have been **moved elsewhere** within the wider branch integration point (unseen in this snippet), **it is safest to return the conflict unmodified**.
