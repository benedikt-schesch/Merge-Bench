The conflict arises from conflicting intentions regarding the inclusion of `PolygonExample` and `TextExample` in the import list. The `HEAD` branch retains these two imports, suggesting they are either required or newly introduced in that branch. Conversely, the `ebfa99cecacf6a332de1194dca867b8b96fb640d` branch omits those two imports entirely, implying that support for these components has either been removed or was never present in that branch.

However, the context provided does not include whitespace or usage patterns (e.g., no consuming code that might clarify whether `PolygonExample` or `TextExample` are actually used in the actual class). As a result, the **semantic intent** and **usage necessity** of these imports remain ambiguous.

Given this ambiguity, **the most accurate merge result in accordance with the provided instructions** is to **preserve the conflict markers**, allowing the next developer with more contextual insight to resolve the decision.
