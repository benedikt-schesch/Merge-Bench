The merge conflict presented has no discernible content within the areas marked for conflict between `HEAD` and `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`. This implies that both branches may have modified or deleted differing sections of code in the same location, yet the visible portion of the conflict and surrounding context offers no conclusive clues about the original state or the intended logic of the merged codebase.

In such a scenario, the safest approach—as advised by the prompt—is to preserve the conflict in its current form since:

- The empty sections in the conflict resolution blocks imply that any attempt at semantic merge relies on missing, assumed, or external content not visible in this snippet.
- Without further code content in the conflicted regions, no intent can be reasonably inferred.

Thus, the correct course of action is to return the snippet exactly as provided.

```java
     * @param mpkg
     * @throws OptimizerException
     */
    private int addShiftedKeyInfoIndex(int initialIndex, int onePastEndIndex,
            MultiQueryPackager mpkgr) throws OptimizerException {
<<<<<<< HEAD

        List<Packager> pkgs = mpkgr.getPackagers();
        // if we have lesser pkgs than (onePastEndIndex - initialIndex)
        // its because one or more of the pkgs is a POMultiQueryPackage which
        // internally has packages.
        int numIndices = (onePastEndIndex - initialIndex);
