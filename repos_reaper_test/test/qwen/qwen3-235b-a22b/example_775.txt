The merge conflict in the provided code snippet occurs in the imports section. The conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`) indicate that both branches modified the same area of the file, but the actual content between the markers is empty on both sides. This suggests that the conflict may have arisen due to changes in line breaks, formatting, or possibly the addition of different imports in the same location.

---

Since the conflict markers are present and the content between them is empty on both sides, and **no actual code changes are visible** within the conflict markers, the **intent and semantics of the merge conflict cannot be determined with certainty**. This ambiguity prevents a confident resolution based solely on the provided snippet.

Therefore, the correct action is to **return the snippet unchanged**, preserving the conflict markers and surrounding context exactly as provided.
