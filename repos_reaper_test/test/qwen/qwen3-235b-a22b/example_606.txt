The conflict in the code snippet arises from a discrepancy regarding the inclusion of the `serialVersionUID` field. Specifically, one version of the branch (`HEAD`) introduces this line, while the other (`a17acec`) omits it.

Upon semantic inspection:
- The `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;` is a field typically included in classes that implement or extend `Serializable`.
- Both sides share the same intent of declaring `MailingAddress`, using similar class structure and field configurations (e.g., Lombok's `@Getter`/`@Setter`).
- However, the absence of the `serialVersionUID` in the second branch could mean either:
  1. The class is not actually intended to be serialized, or
  2. The omission was unintentional or based on a differing assumption about class versioning.

Given this ambiguity regarding whether `MailingAddress` is intended to be serializable—and thus whether `serialVersionUID` is semantically necessary or superfluous—it is not possible to resolve the conflict definitively by intent or interpretation of the class's semantic purpose.

Therefore, as per the instructions, the snippet should be returned **with the conflict fully intact**:

```java

  }

  public static class MailingAddress extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    /**
     * The mailing address ID.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter

```
