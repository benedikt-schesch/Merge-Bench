The resolution of the conflict depends on which variable (`dataItem` or `dataList`) is the correct collection being passed into `unmodifiableList`. However, both options represent the same semantic intent â€” assigning an unmodifiable version of the data list to the class's `this.data` field. Without additional context about which branch introduced a meaningful change or which variable aligns with the intended logic, the correct resolution cannot be determined conclusively.

Thus, the merge conflict remains as is:

```java
      totalCount = jsonSummary.get("total_count") != null ? jsonSummary.getLong("total_count", 0L) : null;
    } else {
      totalCount = null;
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    this.data = unmodifiableList(dataItem);
=======
    this.data = unmodifiableList(dataList);
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    this.facebookClient = facebookClient;
    this.connectionType = connectionType;
  }
