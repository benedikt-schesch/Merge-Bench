The provided merge conflict involves a decision between different licensing headers. Given the original context already includes the Apache License 2.0, while the conflicting changes attempt to either remove the license header entirely (HEAD) or replace it with the Apache License 1.1 (the other branch), the intent behind these changes remains ambiguous. This kind of change should ideally only happen with explicit agreement on the correct license model.

Since the ambiguity prevents a clear, confident resolution based on semantic intent — and altering the license header can have legal implications — it is safest to preserve the conflict markers rather than attempt resolution blindly.
