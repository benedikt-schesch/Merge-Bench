The merge conflict in the import statements requires resolution based on the intent and semantics of the changes.

### Conflict Snapshot:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
=======
import org.jbake.app.configuration.PropertyList;
>>>>>>> d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb
```

---

### Semantic Analysis

The HEAD version imports `JBakeProperty` and `DocumentModel`, while the other branch replaces those lines with an import of `PropertyList`.

Both `JBakeProperty` and `PropertyList` appear to relate to configuration, and `DocumentModel` seems relevant to content modeling or data structures. Given that the context only includes these import lines and no references to how these classes are used in the rest of the file, it is ambiguous whether:

1. `PropertyList` is a new class intended to **replace** `JBakeProperty`, or
2. Both classes are being used **concurrently** for separate configuration purposes.
3. `DocumentModel` is necessary in the final version or was removed intentionally on the branch being merged.

Since these semantic intents cannot be conclusively resolved from the given context alone, **it is safest not to assume intent** and return the conflict markers as-is.
