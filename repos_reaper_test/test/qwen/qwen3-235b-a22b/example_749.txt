The merge conflict involves two distinct sets of imports that likely serve complementary purposes: adding logging support (`org.slf4j`) and concurrency utilities (`java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock`), along with Samo-related components for stream processing and core event handling.

Both sides appear to be adding functionality that can coexist peacefully without semantic overlap or contradiction. Therefore, the appropriate resolution is to retain **all** imports from both changes, removing only the merge conflict markers while preserving all surrounding context and formatting exactly as provided.
