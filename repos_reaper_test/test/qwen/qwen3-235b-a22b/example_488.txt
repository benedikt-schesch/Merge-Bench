	private boolean mPlaceOnScreenControlsAtDifferentVerticalLocations = false;
``` 

The intent of both changes appears to maintain a texture field for on-screen controls while correctly modeling its type in relation to subsequent TextureRegion fields (`mOnScreenControlBaseTextureRegion` and `mOnScreenControlKnobTextureRegion`). The `BitmapTextureAtlas` variant explicitly supports region allocation semantics and aligns with practices in texture atlases/sprite sheets, which is consistent with the use of TextureRegion fields in the class.

Resolution: `private BitmapTextureAtlas mOnScreenControlTexture;` is semantically correct as it allows for defining and using TextureRegion(s) that refer to sub-regions within a single texture atlas.
