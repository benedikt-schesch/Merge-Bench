Here's the resolved merge conflict based on the observed intent of both code branches:

```java
            writeString( prefix, buf );
            writeString( suffix, buf );
            buf.writeByte( friendlyFire );
            if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 )
            {
                writeString( nameTagVisibility, buf );
                writeString( collisionRule, buf );
                // Note: The 'color' writeByte maintained in HEAD is omitted in the other branch
            }
        }
        if ( mode == 0 || mode == 4 )
        {
            if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 )
```

Resolution explanation:
1. Both sides agree to include both `writeString( nameTagVisibility, buf )` and `writeString( collisionRule, buf )` under the Minecraft 1.8+ check
2. The 1.9-specific conditional for `collisionRule` from HEAD was removed as the other branch directly added it under 1.8
3. The `buf.writeByte( color )` line from HEAD was omitted since it was deleted in the other branch
4. There appears to be a minor disagreement about the valid `mode` values (HEAD shows `0 || 3 || 4`, other branch shows `0 || 4`) - since this isn't part of the direct conflict block, we've preserved the original spacing but the mode condition might require manual verification
