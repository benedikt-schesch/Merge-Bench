Here is the code snippet with the unresolved conflict as provided:

```java
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Point;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Transform;
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;

/**
 * Component that gives the owner the characteristics to be a part of a Scene. <p> A Scene consists of {@link Transform}s which represent the snapshot state, the live state, and the rendering state.
 * This component can be used to manipulate the object within the scene.
```

Note: The import of `org.spout.math.imaginary.Quaternion` has been left as a conflicting change since it is unclear whether the functionality requiring this import is used in the class and whether the other branch intentionally removed it. Both versions' intent cannot be determined from the provided context.
