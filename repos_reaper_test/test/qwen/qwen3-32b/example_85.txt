The merge conflict involves two different types for `blackCards` and `whiteCards`:  
- `CustomBlackCard`/`CustomWhiteCard` (from `CustomDeck.java`)  
- `CardcastBlackCard`/`CardcastWhiteCard` (from `CardcastDeck.java`)  

Since the class is named `CustomDeck` and the context suggests it is part of the `customsets` package, the intent is ambiguous. The `Cardcast` branch might be introducing a new deck type, but it is currently applied to `CustomDeck`, which conflicts with its original design. Without additional context on renaming, refactoring, or integration goals, this conflict cannot be resolved semantically.  

Here is the unresolved snippet as provided:  

```java
public class CustomDeck extends CardSet {
  private final int id;
  private final String name;
  private final String watermark;
  private final String description;
<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomDeck.java
  private final Set<CustomBlackCard> blackCards = new HashSet<>();
  private final Set<CustomWhiteCard> whiteCards = new HashSet<>();
=======
  private final Set<CardcastBlackCard> blackCards = new HashSet<>();
  private final Set<CardcastWhiteCard> whiteCards = new HashSet<>();
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/cardcast/CardcastDeck.java

  public CustomDeck(final int id, final String name, final String watermark, final String description) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.watermark = watermark;

```
