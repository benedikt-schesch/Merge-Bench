The merge conflict is resolved by preserving the context and resolving the assertion style to match the `HEAD` branch's syntax, as both branches express the same intent: verifying the exact string values of the cursor fields. Since the semantic meaning is identical and only the assertion syntax differs, we choose the `HEAD` version (`assertThat`) as it represents the current branch's style.

```java
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_withCursor() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = createCursorConnection();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertThat(connection.getAfterCursor()).isEqualTo("NzU1MjI1MjU0");
    assertThat(connection.getBeforeCursor()).isEqualTo("MTY1MTAyNjUxNg==");
=======
    assertEquals("NzU1MjI1MjU0", connection.getAfterCursor());
    assertEquals("MTY1MTAyNjUxNg==", connection.getBeforeCursor());

  }

  private Connection<FacebookType> createCursorConnection() {
    FakeWebRequestor fakeWebRequestor = new FakeWebRequestor() {
      @Override
