The merge conflict involves two different imports from the Apache Commons library, each likely serving a distinct purpose. Since both `DigestUtils` and `FileUtils` are unrelated and provide unique functionalities (cryptographic digests vs. file operations), the correct resolution is to combine both imports.

```java
import javax.annotation.Nonnull;
import javax.annotation.Nullable;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

import org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils;
import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;

/**
 * Various utility methods that don't have more proper home.

```
