Here is the snippet with the unresolved merge conflict:

```java
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	protected MenuScene mMenuScene;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mMenuTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mMenuTexture;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	protected TextureRegion mMenuResetTextureRegion;
	protected TextureRegion mMenuQuitTextureRegion;

	// ===========================================================
	// Constructors
``` 

The conflict remains unresolved due to ambiguity in intent. One side declares `mMenuTexture` as `BitmapTexture` while the other as `BitmapTextureAtlas`. These represent semantically different systems for handling textures, and without additional context about their respective roles in the codebase (e.g., which one handles atlas-based texture management), it is impossible to determine which change should take precedence.
