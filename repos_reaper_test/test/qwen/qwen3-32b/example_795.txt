The provided conflict cannot be resolved definitively due to ambiguity in the intent of both sides. The conflict revolves around the `HBaseRpc rpc` retrieval, which is used in a subsequent `deserializeException` call. However, the context does not clarify whether the removed version (from the other branch) relies on that `rpc` variable or has been refactored to eliminate the dependency. Both sides may intend different behaviors here, and modifying the code without further context could introduce bugs.

```java
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        LOG.error("WTF?  RPC #" + rpcid + ": ", e);
      }
    }

    final HBaseRpc rpc = rpcs_inflight.get(rpcid);
