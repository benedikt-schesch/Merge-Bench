Here is the resolved snippet with the diamond operator syntax adopted, as it's functionally equivalent and more concise:
```java
    }
  }

  private void skipIdlePlayers() {
    killRoundTimer();
    final List<User> playersToRemove = new ArrayList<>();
    final List<Player> playersToUpdateStatus = new ArrayList<>();
    synchronized (roundPlayers) {

      for (final Player player : roundPlayers) {
        final List<WhiteCard> cards = playedCards.getCards(player);
        if (cards == null || cards.size() < blackCard.getPick()) {

```
