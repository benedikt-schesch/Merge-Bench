Here is the resolved snippet with both fields preserved in their original positions:

```java
  private final ConnectedUsers connectedUsers;
  private final GameManager gameManager;
  private final Provider<Session> sessionProvider;
  private final Object blackCardLock = new Object();
  private final GameOptions options;
  private final Set<Integer> customDecksIds = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<Integer>());
  private final Set<String> cardcastDeckIds = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());
  private final Metrics metrics;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showGameLinkProvider;
  private final Provider<String> gamePermalinkFormatProvider;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showRoundLinkProvider;
```

**Resolution explanation:**  
- Both `customDecksIds` (used for numeric deck IDs) and `cardcastDeckIds` (used for string-based deck IDs) serve distinct purposes and are required in the merged code.  
- The order preserves the original `customDecksIds` from the `HEAD` branch while adding the new `cardcastDeckIds` from the other branch, maintaining synchronization and type consistency for concurrently accessed collections.
