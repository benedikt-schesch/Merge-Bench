Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
   * @return The number of likes the page has
   * @since 1.6.5
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  @Facebook
  private Long likes;

  /**
   * The Pages that this Page Likes.
   *
   * @RestFB.GraphApi.Since 2.6

```

**Reason for resolution**:  
Both branches aim to map the Facebook API's "likes" JSON field to the Java class. The `HEAD` branch uses `@Facebook("likes")` with a field named `likesCount`, while the other branch uses `@Facebook` with a field named `likes`. Since RestFB's `@Facebook` annotation defaults to using the field name as the JSON key when no parameter is provided, the field name `likes` aligns semantically with the API key and avoids redundant configuration. This simplifies the mapping and maintains clarity, resolving the conflict in favor of the non-HEAD branch.
