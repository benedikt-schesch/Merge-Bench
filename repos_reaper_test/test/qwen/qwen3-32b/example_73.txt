There is a conflict in the ordering of providers and the positioning of the "All of these delays..." comment between the two branches:

```java
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
  private final Metrics metrics;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showGameLinkProvider;
  private final Provider<String> gamePermalinkFormatProvider;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showRoundLinkProvider;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private final Provider<String> roundPermalinkFormatProvider;

  // All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.
=======
  // All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.
  private final Provider<String> roundPermalinkFormatProvider;
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
  private final Provider<Boolean> allowBlankCardsProvider;
  private final long created = System.currentTimeMillis();
  /**
   * Lock object to prevent judging during idle judge detection and vice-versa.
   */
```

The comment about moving "delays to pyx.properties" is in conflict with the provider ordering, and the intent is ambiguous:
1. One branch added `roundPermalinkFormatProvider` first and then moved the comment below it
2. The other branch placed the comment first and then added the provider after it

This creates a conflict in both field ordering and comment placement that would need to be resolved manually based on design rationale or configuration grouping needs.
