The conflict centers around the declaration of the `deferred` field. One side declares it without a generic type (`Deferred`), while the other introduces a wildcard bound (`Deferred<?>`). The intent appears to improve type safety by parameterizing the `Deferred`. However, without additional context about how this field is used (e.g., if it interacts with specific result types or only serves as a signaling mechanism), it is ambiguous whether the wildcard is necessary or if a concrete type should be specified. To preserve intent and avoid unintended breakage, the conflict remains unresolved.
