/**
 * This class implements a Cuboid common methods for a one dimensional array Cuboid Buffer
 *
 * Elements are stored in column order and each column is +1 on the Z dimension relative to the previous one.
 */


```

**Conflict resolution justification:**

1. Both sides appear to be introducing imports for the `Vector3` class
2. The main branch (HEAD) is using `org.spout.math.vector.Vector3` while the feature branch is using `org.spout.api.math.Vector3`
3. The package structure in the feature branch appears more complete as it also introduces `org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk` which is likely needed for the current namespace
4. The curent branch's import path (`org.spout.api.util.cuboid`) suggests the `api.math.Vector3` would be the appropriate package hierarchy
5. The typical Java import pattern would favor the `org.spout.api.math.Vector3` style if that's the current valid package structure

The context doesn't contain actual usage of these imports, so we can't verify compatibility, but the package naming suggests the feature branch import is more likely to be correct in this API context.
