Here is the resolved code snippet with the conflict resolved by choosing the `jsonHelper` method to maintain consistency with the adjacent `getIntegerFrom` pattern:

```java
       * This is useful if, for example, you've got a @Facebook-annotated string field that you'd like to have a numeric
       * type shoved into.
       *
       * User beware: this will turn *anything* into a string, which might lead to results you don't expect.
       */
      return jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue);
    }

    if (Integer.class.equals(type) || Integer.TYPE.equals(type)) {
      return jsonHelper.getIntegerFrom(rawValue);
    }

```
