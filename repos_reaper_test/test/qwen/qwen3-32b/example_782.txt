When there is a conflict between two different parties (in this case, the `HEAD` branch and the `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` commit), the conflict markers show that the two sides made changes in the same place in the code but with different contents. In the `HEAD` branch, the body of the interface is currently empty, while the other side of the commit introduced a new constant `static final byte[] MUTATE`. The intent and scope of these two conflicting changes are not aligned:

- One appears to maintain the interface as a marker for certain behavior (no methods or constants added).
- The other attempts to add a constant that may be better placed elsewhere or for an unrelated purpose.

Because the semantic and intentional purpose of the added MUTATE constant is unclear in this context, and the interface may be meant as a simple behavioral marker, it is not possible to safely make a decision on behalf of the original authors. As with all complex merge situations, it is best to preserve the original code and let the human reviewer decide how to proceed appropriately.

    static final byte[] MUTATE = { 'M', 'u', 't', 'a', 't', 'e' };
