The conflict is between two formatting conventions for the method `mergeSplitSpecificConf`. Both versions represent the same method signature and behavior semantically. Since the intent is likely to maintain a consistent code style within the file, we will preserve the multi-line formatting with the `throws` clause on its own line as it appears in the `1cb2531c...` branch.

```java
     * is based and merge it with the Conf supplied
     *
     * package level access so that this is not publicly used elsewhere
     * @throws IOException
     */
    static void mergeSplitSpecificConf(LoadFunc loadFunc, PigSplit pigSplit, Configuration originalConf) 
            throws IOException {
        // set up conf with entries from input specific conf
        Job job = new Job(originalConf);
        loadFunc.setLocation(getLoadLocation(pigSplit.getInputIndex(),
                originalConf), job);
        // The above setLocation call could write to the conf within
```
