The conflict involves two changes in a `ViewHolder` class within a Java code snippet. On the `HEAD` side, a view called `followBtn` is added, while the incoming merge (from `66827e951a3a7f558f4174b3bd6fbe5bf3fa50d8`) replaces it with a `testBtn`. Since the code context does **not** include usage of these fields (e.g., in `getView()`), the intent and relationship between `followBtn` and `testBtn` cannot be determined with certainty. For example:

- Is `testBtn` a replacement for `followBtn` during testing?
- Is this a temporary placeholder (`testBtn`) for future work, or a functional change?
- Was `followBtn` part of a completed feature?

Given the ambiguity, the conflict is unresolved below.

```java
	private static class ViewHolder {
		public ImageView profileImage;
		public TextView screenName;
		public TextView userId;
		public TextView lastStatus;
<<<<<<< HEAD
		public TextView followBtn;
=======
		public TextView testBtn;
>>>>>>> 66827e951a3a7f558f4174b3bd6fbe5bf3fa50d8
	}

	@Override
	public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
		View view;
```
