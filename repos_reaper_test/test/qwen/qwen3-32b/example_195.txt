To address the provided merge conflict in the `getClassForAlias` method, the primary divergence is between the types and initializations of the `className` and `funcSpec` variables.

The branch represented by `HEAD` (left side) declares both variables as `String`, setting `funcSpec` (and only `funcSpec`) to `null`. This suggests the variable types are expected to remain as strings, with `funcSpec` perhaps intended to contain serialized or encoded function specification data.

The right side (branch `1488b22...`) declares `className` with its own initialization (`null`) and changes `funcSpec` from `String` to a type called `FuncSpec`, which likely represents some form of richer object containing function metadata.

Given this divergence in type (from `String` to a `FuncSpec` class), and without clear indication that one side has been deprecated or should override the other, the **intent ambiguity** is non-trivial:

- If `definedFunctions.get(alias)` returns a `String`, the right branchâ€™s re-typing to `FuncSpec` must involve logic to convert or deserialize it.
- If `definedFunctions` now returns a `FuncSpec`, the left branch is clearly out of sync.

Because the **semantic purpose** of these variables is unclear from the context (no indication of how `funcSpec` is used downstream or how `definedFunctions` maps data), it is not possible to determine unambiguously which version should prevail without additional information or context.

Hence, the conflict is **preserved** as written:

```java
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }
    
    
    public Class getClassForAlias(String alias) throws IOException{
<<<<<<< HEAD
        String className, funcSpec = null;
=======
        String className = null;
        FuncSpec funcSpec = null;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        if (definedFunctions != null) {
            funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias);
        }
        if (funcSpec != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
