Here's the resolved snippet with the original logging mechanism retained since it's more appropriate for a production environment than `System.out.println`:

```java
  static {
    try {
      IS_WINDOWS =
          StandardSystemProperty.OS_NAME.value().toLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH).startsWith("windows");
    } catch (Throwable ex) {
      Logger.getLogger(FileDataStoreFactory.class.getName()).severe(ex.getMessage());
      throw ex;
    }
  }

  /** Directory to store data. */
```

Both versions ultimately aim to log the error and re-throw the exception. The HEAD version uses standard logging via `java.util.logging.Logger` which is preferred for error handling in applications, while the merge branch temporarily replaced with direct `System.out.println` calls - a debugging practice rather than proper logging.
