The conflict in the code snippet is due to a formatting difference in the line where the minimum height is set. Both sides of the conflict are semantically identical, as they are multiplying the result of `getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.widget_option_button_size)` by `3`. The only difference is that one side uses a single line, while the other splits the line for improved readability.

Since the **intent** is clear—setting the minimum height to three times the size of the option button—and the **semantics** are identical, this conflict can be resolved by choosing either formatting style. For consistency with the rest of the method (which prefers compact single-line expressions), we will resolve the conflict in favor of the original (HEAD) version.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
    private void initialize() {
        // Set padding
        int pad = getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.widget_container_padding) * 2;
        this.setPadding(pad, pad, pad, pad);
        this.setMinimumHeight(getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.widget_option_button_size) * 3);
    }

    @Override
    public void onFinishInflate() {
        super.onFinishInflate();

```
