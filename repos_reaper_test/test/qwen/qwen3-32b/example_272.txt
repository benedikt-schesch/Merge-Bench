The merge conflict in this snippet is due to a formatting difference in the use of the ternary operator in the `setKeyType` method. Both versions of the code implement the **same logic**: if `fields` is `null` or has more than one element, use `DataType.TUPLE` as the key type. Otherwise, use the provided `keyType`. This is purely a style difference between a single-line and a multi-line representation of the same conditional assignment.

Resolving the conflict by adopting the right-hand side (from commit `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) is justified as it maintains consistent formatting with the surrounding codebase and does not alter semantics.

Here is the fully resolved snippet with the conflict resolved and context preserved as requested:

```java
        }

        POPackage pkg = new POPackage(new OperatorKey(scope,
                nig.getNextNodeId(scope)));
        LitePackager pkgr = new LitePackager();
        pkgr.setKeyType((fields == null || fields.length > 1) ? DataType.TUPLE
                : keyType);
        pkg.setPkgr(pkgr);
        pkg.setNumInps(1);
        mro.reducePlan.add(pkg);

        PhysicalPlan ep = new PhysicalPlan();
