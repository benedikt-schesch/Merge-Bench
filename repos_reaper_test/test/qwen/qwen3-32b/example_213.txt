Here's the resolved conflict by adopting the more specific method name from the other branch:

```java
    
    Boolean[] nullFlags = new Boolean[]{ false, true};

    MiniCluster cluster = MiniCluster.buildCluster();
    @Test
    public void testGroupCountWithMultipleFields() throws Throwable {
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
        for (int k = 0; k < nullFlags.length; k++) {
            System.err.println("Running testGroupCountWithMultipleFields with nullFlags set to " + nullFlags[k]);
            // flag to indicate if both the keys forming
            // the group key are null

```

### Rationale:
- The `nullFlags` array and the loop suggest a test that validates behavior for both null and non-null group keys.
- The `testGroupCountWithMultipleFields` name explicitly indicates the test is about multi-field group operations with potential null handling.
- The comment further confirms this context by mentioning keys forming a group.
- The more generic name (`testGroupCount`) would inaccurately imply single-field testing, which is inconsistent with the implementation.
