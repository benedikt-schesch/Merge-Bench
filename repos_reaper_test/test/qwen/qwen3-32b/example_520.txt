After carefully analyzing both versions of the code and their semantic intent, here is the resolved snippet that reflects the correct merge resolution. The resolution incorporates the array-based assignment introduced in one branch while preserving the correct method call parameter from the other, which includes the `node`. This ensures that the `argument` is correctly calculated based on the `node` context and then assigned to the `arguments` array as required by the array-based logic.

```java
        for (Port port : inputs) {
            Object argument;
            if (argumentMap.containsKey(port)) {
                argument = argumentMap.get(port);
            } else if (port.hasValueRange()) {
                argument = getPortValue(node, port);
            } else {
                // The port expects a list but nothing is connected. Evaluate with an empty list.
                argument = ImmutableList.of();
            }
            arguments[i] = argument;
```
