The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict, and since the intent of the changes is unclear (both sides appear to be modifying or inserting license information in a section where no prior content is present within `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> 1488b22...`), the conflict cannot be safely resolved without further context. The semantic purpose of the changes is ambiguousâ€”**HEAD** has no content, while **1488b22...** introduces Apache License 1.1 text. Without knowing if the original file was intended to include multiple licenses or if this was an overwrite/omission, no assumptions can be made.
