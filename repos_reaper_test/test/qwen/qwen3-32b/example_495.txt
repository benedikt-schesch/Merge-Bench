Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved due to ambiguous intent:

```java
					ModPlayerExample.this.startPlayingMod();
				}
			});
		}

<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTexture);
=======
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());

```

### Conflict Analysis:
Both branches are attempting to load a texture resource but differ in the specific field used:
- **HEAD branch** uses `mBitmapTexture` (likely a single `ITexture` instance)
- **91801fd branch** uses `mBitmapTextureAtlas` (likely a `TextureAtlas` or `BitmapTextureAtlas`)

This reflects a common ambiguity in AndEngine projects where developers might switch between:
1. Single textured assets (`ITexture`)
2. Texture atlases (`TextureAtlas`) for batching/sprite sheet optimization

The correct resolution depends on whether the project now requires individual texture management or atlas-based rendering. Since this is structural and likely affects multiple rendering components, manual verification is required for correctness.
