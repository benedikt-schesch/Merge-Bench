Here is the resolved snippet with the merge conflict:

```java
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Point;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Transform;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector2;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.spout.api.protocol.CommonHandler;
=======
>>>>>>> 67bcb76a96f358fc131320b0611ffaa3bf3678c2
import org.spout.api.protocol.CommonPipelineFactory;
import org.spout.api.protocol.PortBinding;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Protocol;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Session;
import org.spout.api.render.RenderMode;
```

The conflict was preserved because:
1. The `CommonHandler` import appears in the HEAD branch but is absent in the 67bcb76a branch
2. Without seeing the full code context beyond the imports (which is not provided), it's impossible to determine if `CommonHandler` is actually used/needed in the codebase
3. The semantic intent of both branches is ambiguous - one branch added the import while the other removed/delete it
4. Mandatory changes assessment requires the implementation context to determine if the import is necessary
