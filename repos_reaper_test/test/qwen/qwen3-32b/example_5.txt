Here is the resolved merge conflict, with all three fields (nameTagVisibility, collisionRule, and color) preserved and ordered according to protocol version semantics:

```java
            prefix = readString( buf );
            suffix = readString( buf );
            friendlyFire = buf.readByte();
            if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 )
            {
                nameTagVisibility = readString( buf );
                if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_9 )
                {
                    collisionRule = readString( buf );
                }
                color = buf.readByte();
            }
        }
        if ( mode == 0 || mode == 3 || mode == 4 )
        {
            int len = ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 ) ? readVarInt( buf ) : buf.readShort();
```

### Resolution Strategy:
- **`nameTagVisibility`** and **`color`** are preserved under Minecraft 1.8 logic (matching HEAD).
- **`collisionRule`** is conditionally preserved under Minecraft 1.9 logic (from HEAD) to avoid functionally conflicting with the branch-side 1.8 placement.
- The original structure and spacing are fully maintained.
- All added fields are preserved with protocol version constraints matching HEAD's implementation.
