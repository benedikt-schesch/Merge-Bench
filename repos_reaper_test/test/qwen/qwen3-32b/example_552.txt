The conflict lies in the punctuation of the `@return` description in the Javadoc comment. Both sides intend to document that the method returns `true` if the input is `null` or empty, but differ only in whether a period is included. Since the semantic content and method behavior are identical, and the period is standard in Javadoc for completeness, the period should be retained for consistency.

```java
     * you won't need special null-safe forms of methods like
     * {@link String#toUpperCase} either.
     * 
     * @param string
     *            a string reference to check
     * @return {@code true} if the string is null or is the empty string.
     */
    public static boolean isNullOrEmpty(String string) {
        return string == null || string.isEmpty();
    }
