The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict due to differing access modifiers for the `empty` variable in the `POStore` class. Both branches aim to define a `static Result` instance with the same initialization, but disagree on its access scope (`protected` vs `private`). Without clear contextual evidence of whether the `empty` field should be accessible to subclasses or restricted entirely, the intent cannot be determined definitively. The conflict is preserved below as instructed:

```java
 *
 */
public class POStore extends PhysicalOperator {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    protected static Result empty = new Result(POStatus.STATUS_NULL, null);
=======
    private static Result empty = new Result(POStatus.STATUS_NULL, null);
