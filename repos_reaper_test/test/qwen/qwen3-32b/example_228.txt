Here is the resolved conflict in the code snippet:

```java
    private PigServer pig;
    
    @Before
    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
        pig = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
    }

    @Test
    public void testBigGroupAll() throws Throwable {
        
```

The conflict was resolved by using `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` as an explicit enum constant rather than the raw constant `MAPREDUCE`. This change improves type safety and aligns with Java best practices for enum usage, while maintaining functional equivalence to the original implementation.
