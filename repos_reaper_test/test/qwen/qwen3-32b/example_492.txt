It is unclear which change represents the correct refactoring or which field is necessary for the code's broader context â€” `BitmapTexture` (a single texture) vs. `BitmapTextureAtlas` (a collection/manager for textures) serve different purposes and would coexist in different scenarios. Retaining both sides of the conflict maintains the ambiguity:

```java
	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d

	private TiledTextureRegion mBoxFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mCircleFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mTriangleFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mHexagonFaceTextureRegion;
