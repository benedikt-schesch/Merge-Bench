The merge conflict is between two formatting conventions for the method declaration in Java. The core logic is consistent across both branches:

- **Both implement the same functionality**: `longs.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);`  
- **Only the method declaration style differs**:  
  - `isNotEqualTo(long expected)` ✅ (现有代码风格)  
  - `isNotEqualTo(long expected) {` ❌ (添加空格)

Given that the existing `isEqualTo` method also uses the style `isEqualTo(expected) {` without a space, we resolve the conflict in favor of the existing code style to maintain consistency.

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected){
=======
  public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    longs.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
```
