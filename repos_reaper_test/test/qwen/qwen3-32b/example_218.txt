The conflict arises from a change in how the `PigServer` constructor accepts the execution type. The left side uses the outdated approach (direct use of `MAPREDUCE`), while the right side adopts the newer `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` enum. The semantic intent in both cases is to initialize the `PigServer` for MapReduce execution. The resolution favors the updated enum-based usage as it aligns with the expected modern API.

```java
    private PigServer pig;
    
    @Before
    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
        pig = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
    }
    
    Boolean[] nullFlags = new Boolean[] { false, true };

    @Test
    public void testAdd() throws Throwable {
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
        
```
