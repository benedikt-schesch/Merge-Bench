Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
import java.util.jar.JarEntry;
import java.util.jar.JarInputStream;
import java.util.jar.JarOutputStream;
import java.util.zip.ZipEntry;

import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.PigMapReduce;

public class JarManager {



```

The conflict was resolved by selecting the import statement from the non-HEAD side (`mapReduceLayer`) which appears to contain the corrected package structure (using camelCase naming convention appropriately), while ensuring we still retain the necessary `PigContext` import from `org.apache.pig.impl`. Both versions shared this common import, and the PigMapReduce import had the same class name but different (likely version-migrated) package paths.
