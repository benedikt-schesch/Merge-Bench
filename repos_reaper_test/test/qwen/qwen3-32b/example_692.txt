The merge conflict appears between the `failureNotificationsEventProperty` and the subsequent `failureNotificationsDelayProperty`. The context spans failure and success behavior notification declarations in the schema, where `failureNotificationsDelayProperty` is present in the current branch (`HEAD`) as an `IntProperty` representing the delay in hiding failure notifications. The `d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5` side of the conflict does not include this line. As no ambiguity is found in the intent—to add an integer-typed delay—resolution can safely include this property.

Here is the resolved snippet with full context and spacing preserved:

```java
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsProperty        = new StringProperty("failureNotifications").hint("Notifications after failed execution of action").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsPartialProperty = new StringProperty("failureNotificationsPartial").hint("CSS selector for partial to display as failure notification").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsEventProperty   = new StringProperty("failureNotificationsEvent").hint("Event to raise for failure notifications").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<Integer> failureNotificationsDelayProperty  = new IntProperty("failureNotificationsDelay").hint("Delay before hiding failure notifications").defaultValue(5000).partOfBuiltInSchema();

	public static final Property<String> successBehaviourProperty = new StringProperty("successBehaviour").hint("Behaviour after successful execution of action").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successPartialProperty   = new StringProperty("successPartial").hint("CSS selector for partial to refresh on success").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successURLProperty       = new StringProperty("successURL").hint("URL to navigate to on success").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successEventProperty     = new StringProperty("successEvent").hint("Event to raise on success").partOfBuiltInSchema();
