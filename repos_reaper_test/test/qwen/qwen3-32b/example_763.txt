Here is the resolved code snippet with the conflict resolved to enable piggybacking version requests as intended, while preserving all semantic behavior and applying `final` modifiers consistently:

```java
        // Piggyback a version request in the 1st packet, after the payload
        // we were trying to send.  This way we'll have the version handy
        // pretty quickly.  Since it's most likely going to fit in the same
        // packet we send out, it adds ~zero overhead.  But don't piggyback
        // a version request if the payload is already a version request.
        final ChannelBuffer buf;
        if (!isVersionRequest(payload)) {
          final RegionClient client = ctx.getPipeline().get(RegionClient.class);
          final ChannelBuffer version =
              client.encode(client.getProtocolVersionRequest());
          buf = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(header, payload, version);
        } else {
```

### Resolution Explanation:
1. **Conditional Logic**: The `if (false && ...)` check in `HEAD` was effectively disabling the feature. This was a likely leftover from a debugging or temporary override. The cleanup commit (`8063e77`) is enabling the intended behavior by using `if (!isVersionRequest(payload))` as the original comment describes.

2. **`final` Modifiers**: The conflict on `ChannelBuffer buf` reflects a code quality improvement to use `final` for mutable variables that are assigned once. This was added in the cleanup commit and preserved here.

3. **Semantic Preservation**: The core logic of appending a version request only when the payload is not already a version request is unchanged. This ensures the optimization described in the comment (avoiding redundant requests and minimizing overhead) is preserved.

The `else` clause is not fully visible in the snippet, but its presence is implied for completeness based on the context.
