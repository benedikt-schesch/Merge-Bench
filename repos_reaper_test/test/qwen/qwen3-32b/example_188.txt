The merge conflict presented involves the addition of the `skip()` method in the version represented by commit `1488b22...`. The `read()` method remains unchanged in the `HEAD` version and in the other branch.

---

The conflict arises because the `skip()` method is not present in the `HEAD` version and is being added in the other branch. Resolving this simply involves including the new `skip()` method, as this does not conflict in any meaningful way with the `read()` method above it. Both methods work synergistically to track the `pos` variable, a likely intent for both contributors.

Here is the properly resolved and correctly formatted string representation of the merged code in markdown `java` syntax:

```java
    public int read(byte b[], int off, int len) throws IOException {
        int read = in.read(b, off, len);
        pos += read;
        return read;
    }

    @Override
    public long skip(long n) throws IOException {
        long rc = in.skip(n);
        pos += rc;
        return rc;
    }
```
