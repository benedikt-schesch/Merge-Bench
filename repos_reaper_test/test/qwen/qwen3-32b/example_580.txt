Here's the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved:

```java
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
   * @since 1.6.13
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private ProfilePictureSource picture;
=======
  private String picture;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  @Facebook("picture")
  private JsonObject rawPicture;

  /**

```

The semantic intent of both sides is ambiguous in this context. The merge conflict is between:
1. HEAD using `ProfilePictureSource` (a typed object)
2. Other branch using `String` (a primitive type)

Both maintain the `@Facebook("picture")` mapping on `rawPicture`, but differ in the typing of the `picture` field itself. Without additional context about the relationship between the types and their responsibilities, the conflict cannot be resolved with certainty.
