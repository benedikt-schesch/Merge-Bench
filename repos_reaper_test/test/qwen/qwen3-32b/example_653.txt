Here is the resolved code snippet with the conflict resolved by combining the `@see` tag from the other branch into the `getData()` method's Javadoc:

```java
  private List<Comment> data = new ArrayList<Comment>();

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  /**
   * @see java.lang.Object#hashCode()
   * The comments.
   *
   * @return The comments.
   */
  public List<Comment> getData() {
```
