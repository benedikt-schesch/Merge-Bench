Here is the merged code snippet with the conflict resolved by including the necessary import from the other branch, as it likely represents the addition of `VertexBufferObjectManager`-related functionality:

```java
import org.andengine.input.touch.TouchEvent;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.region.ITextureRegion;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.region.TextureRegionFactory;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.render.RenderTexture;
import org.andengine.opengl.util.GLState;
import org.andengine.opengl.vbo.VertexBufferObjectManager;
import org.andengine.ui.activity.SimpleBaseGameActivity;
import org.andengine.util.modifier.ease.EaseQuadInOut;

import android.widget.Toast;
```

The merge is resolved by taking the import from the `e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885` branch. Since `VertexBufferObjectManager` is a core AndEngine class often used alongside rendering/textures, its inclusion suggests the other branch introduced features requiring this dependency (e.g., custom `Sprite` or `VertexBufferObjectManager` usage). The merge conflict was straightforward and resolvable based on semantic intent.
