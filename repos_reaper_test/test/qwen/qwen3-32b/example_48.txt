Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict merged semantically:

```java
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      playerNames.add(player.getUser().getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.PLAYERS, playerNames);

    final User[] spectatorsCopy = spectators.toArray(new User[0]);
    final List<String> spectatorNames = new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length);
    for (final User spectator : spectatorsCopy) {
      spectatorNames.add(spectator.getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.SPECTATORS, spectatorNames);
```

**Resolution reasoning:**  
Both sides aim to create a list of spectator nicknames in a similar fashion to the existing player nickname list. The conflict involves two minor implementation differences:

1. **Array creation pattern**  
   The `toArray(new User[0])` approach from the other branch is more robust: it avoids reliance on the current collection size (which might change between method calls) and is a common Java idiom.

2. **Diamond operator**  
   The `ArrayList<>` syntax is modern and more readable than explicitly repeating generic types. It aligns with Java 7+ best practices.

The resolved version maintains the same semantic behavior while adopting the more robust and idiomatic implementation.
