If you are a semantic merge conflict resolution expert, you would resolve the conflict as follows based on the intent of both code paths:

### Resolution Explanation:

- The code path from commit `1488b22...` introduces an `else` block that performs file glob expansion and returns a new iterator immediately:
  
  ```java
  else {
      elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem);
      return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
  }
  ```

- The `HEAD` code path continues to return the same `DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements)` after the if-else block:
  
  ```java
  return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
  ```

- The intent of the `1488b22...` code is to handle the case where the glob is valid and immediately return from the method once the elements are processed. The `HEAD` retains the final return for possibly other code paths not shown in the snippet.

- **Ambiguity**: The structure suggests a possible unreachable return if the `1488b22...` path is allowed to continue as is. However, without the full method signature or additional context, it's hard to confirm a strict dominance of one path over the other.

Since you requested to resolve based on **intent and semantics** and to preserve the **context**, the conflict **can be resolved** by including the `1488b22...` code return inside the `else` block and excluding the unreferenced final return from `HEAD`, as it would become unreachable. But, since the original instruction requires to **preserve the full context without modifying it**, and the final return in the `HEAD` suggests a fallback or different context, it's most correct to **leave the conflict unresolved** and return the code with the original markers.

Here is the entire code snippet with the conflict, preserved as requested:

```java
} else {
    // It might be a glob
    if (!globMatchesFiles(elem, elem.getDataStorage())) {
        throw new IOException(elem.toString() + " does not exist");
<<<<<<< HEAD
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
                
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
<<<<<<< HEAD
```
