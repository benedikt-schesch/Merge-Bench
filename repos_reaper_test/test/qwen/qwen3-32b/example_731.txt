Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
            final ThumbnailFlinger flinger = new ThumbnailFlinger(CameraActivity.this);
            mHandler.post(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    layout.addView(flinger);
<<<<<<< HEAD
                    flinger.setRotation(mOrientationCompensation+90);
=======
                    flinger.setRotation(90);
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
                    flinger.setImageBitmap(info.mThumbnail);
                    flinger.doAnimation();
                }
            });
```

The conflict resolves whether to apply an additional orientation compensation (`mOrientationCompensation + 90`) or fix the rotation to `90` degrees. The first side dynamically adjusts rotation based on device orientation compensation, while the second enforces a fixed rotation. The intent depends on the desired behavior regarding device orientation handling and whether the animation needs to respect the original camera orientation. Since the context does not clarify the correct semantic choice, the conflict is preserved.
