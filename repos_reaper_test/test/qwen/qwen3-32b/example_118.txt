Here is the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict resolved by combining both changes:

```java
    private boolean fromPaginated;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        loadArguments();
        if (autoStart()) {
            executeRequest();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreateView(inflater, container, savedInstanceState);
```

**Resolution justification**:  
Both branches needed `loadArguments()` in `onCreate()`. The conflict arose because one branch added the `autoStart()` check logic after the other branch had already added `loadArguments()`. The intent was clear: call `loadArguments()` and then conditionally execute a request if `autoStart()` is true. The merge keeps both changes in order of semantic dependency.
