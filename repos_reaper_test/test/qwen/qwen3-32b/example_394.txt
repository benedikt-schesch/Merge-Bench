The correct approach is to resolve the merge conflict by considering the semantics of both branches. The primary differences are:

- The `@Test` annotation's visibility (`void` vs `public void`)
- The method name typo in `preapteCore` (correcting it is crucial)
- The test setup and verification logic is otherwise functionally identical between both branches

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
		assertEquals(1, updates);
		verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));
	}

	@Test
	public void shouldUpdateCoreOnAutoBuild() throws CoreException {
		InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 10);

		workspace.updateProjects(Collections.singleton(resource));

		assertStatusIs(findingTests(0, projects.size(), 0));
		verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));
```

**Resolution logic**:
- Took `public void` from the `ee249315` branch (essential for JUnit 5 test methods)
- Corrected the typo in `preapteCore` to `prepareCore` (from `ee249315` branch)
- Kept the test logic as it's fundamentally the same between both branches
