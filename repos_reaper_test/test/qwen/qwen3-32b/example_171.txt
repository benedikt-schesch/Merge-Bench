The merge conflict in the provided code snippet appears to be a false positive, as both sides of the conflict (HEAD and the commit) are semantically and syntactically identical in the lines they attempt to resolve. The logic for checking if `wrapper == null`, throwing an exception, and calling `openDFSFile(...)` remains unchanged between the two branches. Since no actual divergence in behavior or purpose exists between the conflicting branches, the conflict can safely be resolved by removing the markers while preserving the original functionality and surrounding context.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName, JobConf wrapper) throws IOException {
        if (wrapper == null)
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "can't open DFS file while executing locally");
        
        return openDFSFile(fileName, ConfigurationUtil.toProperties(wrapper.getJobConf()));

    }

    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName, Properties properties) throws IOException {
        DataStorage dds = new HDataStorage(properties);
        ElementDescriptor elem = dds.asElement(fileName);
```

By eliminating the conflict markers and retaining the identical code, we preserve the original intent: ensuring that a non-null `JobConf` wrapper is provided to safely convert it to properties and then use it to open a DFS file.
