The conflict is between the presence and absence of the `@Beta` annotation on the `isMtls()` method. The intent is ambiguous: one side marks it as beta (possibly for deprecation notice), while the other removes it (possibly considering it stable or unnecessary). Since the semantic resolution depends on unresolved design decisions, the conflict remains unresolved.

```java
  public boolean supportsMethod(String method) {
    return Arrays.binarySearch(SUPPORTED_METHODS, method) >= 0;
  }

  @Override

  }

  @Override
