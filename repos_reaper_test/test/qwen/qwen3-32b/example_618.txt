The intent of both sides appears to be non-overlapping: one adds a field declaration, the other adds a method. The conflict arises from the Git diff's placement due to surrounding context sensitivity. Since the `addCity` method and `locales` field don't conflict semantically or structurally:

```java
          regions.add(mapper.toJavaObject(region, KeyedType.class));
        }
      }
    }

    @Facebook
    protected List<Integer> locales = new ArrayList<Integer>();

    public boolean addCity(KeyedType city) {
      if (geoLocations != null) {
        return geoLocations.addCity(city);
      }
      return cities.add(city);
```

The merge conflict is resolved by including both changes without modification to the surrounding context.
