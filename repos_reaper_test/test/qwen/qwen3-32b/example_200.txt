Here's the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict resolved by accepting the change from the incoming branch:

```java
    /**
     * a table mapping names to streaming commands.
     */
    private Map<String, StreamingCommand> definedCommands = 
        new HashMap<String, StreamingCommand>();
        
    private static ArrayList<String> packageImportList = new ArrayList<String>();

    public boolean debug = true;
    
    // List of paths skipped for automatic shipping
```

The merge conflict was resolved by accepting the addition of the `packageImportList` static field from the incoming branch (`1488b22...`). The `definedCommands` field remains unchanged, and no semantic conflicts were detected since the added field is independent of the existing fields.
