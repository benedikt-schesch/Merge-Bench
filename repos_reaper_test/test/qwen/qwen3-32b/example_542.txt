Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict resolved by retaining both declarations with merged comments:

```java
        scanCallbackContext.sendPluginResult(pluginResult);
      }
    }
  };

//API 21+ Scan and Advertise Callbacks
//Scan Callback
  private ScanCallback scanCallback = null;
  private AdvertiseCallback advertiseCallback = null;

  //TODO Is there a cleaner way to prevent this from running on KitKat
  protected void pluginInitialize() {
    if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
      return;
```
