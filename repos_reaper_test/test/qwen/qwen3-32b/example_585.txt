Here is the resolved code with the conflict resolved:

```java
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
 * THE SOFTWARE.
 */
package com.restfb;

import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.fromInputStream;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

import com.restfb.WebRequestor.Response;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookJsonMappingException;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookOAuthException;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookResponseContentException;

```

The intent of both sides appears to be introducing static import dependencies for test assertions, but they represent a migration from AssertJ to JUnit assertions. The semantic resolution favors the updated JUnit migrations in the other branch as it represents a more modern testing approach in the ecosystem.
