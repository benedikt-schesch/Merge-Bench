The intent is ambiguous as the two branches are defining different texture variables for the font with varying types and names. Resolving this would require understanding which implementation (BitmapTexture vs. BitmapTextureAtlas) is appropriate for the Font usage in the broader context, which is not available here. The correct resolution is not determinable without additional information.
