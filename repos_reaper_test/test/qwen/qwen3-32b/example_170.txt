Here's the resolved code snippet, incorporating both the original description about HDFS file access and the added Javadoc-style documentation for clarity and API consistency:

```java
    /**
     * This function is meant to be used if the mappers/reducers want to access
     * any HDFS file
     * @param fileName
     * @return InputStream of the open file.
     * @throws IOException
     */
    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        SliceWrapper wrapper = PigInputFormat.getActiveSplit();

        if (wrapper == null)
```
