The conflict arises from two separate additions of new imports in the code: `WorldLoadEvent` and `WorldUnloadEvent` from the `HEAD` (representing ongoing development related to world event handling), and `ConfigurationException` from the other branch (likely for handling configuration errors). Since these are distinct concerns and both represent necessary imports for their respective features, they can be safely merged without conflict or ambiguity.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
import org.spout.api.command.CommandSource;
import org.spout.api.command.annotated.AnnotatedCommandExecutorFactory;
import org.spout.api.event.EventManager;
import org.spout.api.event.SimpleEventManager;
import org.spout.api.event.server.permissions.PermissionGetAllWithNodeEvent;
import org.spout.api.event.world.WorldLoadEvent;
import org.spout.api.event.world.WorldUnloadEvent;
import org.spout.api.exception.ConfigurationException;
import org.spout.api.exception.SpoutRuntimeException;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Point;
import org.spout.api.inventory.recipe.RecipeManager;
```

Both branches are preserved in the merged version.
