Here is the resolved code snippet with proper semantic integration:

```java
		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);		
	}

	@Test
    void shouldNotUpdateIfClassesAreNotChanged() throws CoreException {
        assertDoesNotThrow(() -> processor.processEvent(emptyEvent()));
        verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
    }

	@Test
	void shouldRespondToPostBuildEvents() {
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, POST_BUILD, AUTO_BUILD, null);
```

**Resolution reasoning**:  
Both branches are implementing the same test to verify behavior when classes are not changed. The `HEAD` version:
1. Focuses on exception safety using `assertDoesNotThrow()`
2. Uses a standard Java test method declaration (non-public - valid in JUnit 5)
3. Does not include the verification interaction

The `ee24931` branch:
1. Uses a traditional `public void` JUnit 4 style method signature
2. Explicitly verifies no interactions with `verifyNoInteractions(workspace)`

The semantic conflict has been resolved by combining these into a single implementation:  
1. Retaining the JUnit 5 style `void` method declaration (more modern)  
2. Keeping the exception safety assert from `HEAD`  
3. Adding the interaction verification from `ee24931` as the second assert  
4. Maintaining the exact same test method name and parameter signature from both versions
