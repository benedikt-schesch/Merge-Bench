Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict resolved by selecting the grammatically correct "count on" from the 1488b22ce313... commit:

```java
    public void bindTo(String fileName, BufferedPositionedInputStream in, long offset, long end) throws IOException {
        this.in = in;
        this.end = end;
        // Since we are not block aligned we throw away the first
        // record and count on a different instance to read it
        if (offset != 0)
            getNext();
    }

    public Tuple getNext() throws IOException {
```

The semantic resolution keeps the original meaning that when processing isn't block-aligned, the code discards the first record and relies on another processing instance to eventually read it, which is a common pattern in distributed stream processing systems.
