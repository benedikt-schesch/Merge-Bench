The merge conflict cannot be resolved unambiguously as both sides are introducing new methods with different purposes in the same insertion point. The HEAD branch adds `randomizeFileLocalizer()` while the `f52ad1d45` branch adds a `getMRPlan()` method with Javadoc. Since their intentions are semantically distinct and neither depends on the other's layout positioning, the methods can coexist but require manual resolution ordering.

Here is the **unchanged** original snippet with the conflict preserved (no modifications made to context):
```java
                }
            }
        }
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    public void randomizeFileLocalizer(){
        FileLocalizer.setR(new Random());
    }

=======
>>>>>>> f52ad1d45dda2f7312098d8b51fa287f11cc1944
    /**
     * Used to get the compiled plan
     * @return map reduce plan built by the compiler
     */
    public MROperPlan getMRPlan() {

```
