Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict addressed by merging both sides' contributions:

```java
            // bind to service
            mServiceConnection = new OpenPgpServiceConnection(
                    PgpHandler.this, providerPackageName, this);
            mServiceConnection.bindToService();

            bindingDialog = new ProgressDialog(this);
            bindingDialog.setMessage(this.getResources().getString(R.string.okc_progress_text));
            bindingDialog.setCancelable(false);
            bindingDialog.show();

            registered = true;
            getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);
        }
    }
```

The resolution includes:
1. **ProgressDialog addition (HEAD side):** Shows a user-friendly spinner while binding to a service (important for UI feedback).
2. **Code continuation (other branch):** Retains `registered = true` and `setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled()` from the other branch to ensure UI logic progresses after binding initiates.

Both changes are necessary for full functionality: the ProgressDialog informs the user of the binding process, and the subsequent flags enable proper navigation behavior.
