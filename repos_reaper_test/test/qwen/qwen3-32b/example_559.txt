Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict markers preserved:

```java
 * THE SOFTWARE.
 */
package com.restfb;

import static java.net.HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown;
=======
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

import com.restfb.exception.FacebookJsonMappingException;
import com.restfb.types.FacebookType;
import com.restfb.types.User;


```

The conflict cannot be resolved automatically because the intent is ambiguous: both sides are importing assertion utility methods (AssertJ vs JUnit's static assertions), but it's unclear which testing framework the project ultimately plans to use. The decision requires checking existing usage patterns in the codebase for either framework.
