Here is the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict handled by preserving both additions as they are non-conflicting and semantically separate:

```java
    // handle to the back-end
    transient private ExecutionEngine executionEngine;
   
    private String jobName = JOB_NAME_PREFIX;    // can be overwritten by users
  
    // Pig Script Output
    private String jobOutputFile = "";
    
    // JobConf of the currently executing Map-Reduce job
    JobConf jobConf;
    
    private Properties properties;
    
    /**
     * a table mapping function names to function specs.
     */
```

**Conflict resolution explanation**: The two sides added completely unrelated fields (`jobOutputFile` and `jobConf` from HEAD vs `properties` from the other branch). Since they serve distinct purposes (output configuration vs system properties), their semantical intents do not conflict, and all necessary variables are preserved in their original order of declaration.
