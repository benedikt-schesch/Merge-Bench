The conflict between the two branches appears to involve the verification of whether users are allowed to comment (`comments.getCanComment()`). Given the surrounding test code, both branches are testing similar permissions logic (e.g., `canLike()` in the `Likes` section). While one branch explicitly checks `canComment()`, the other omits it entirely.

Since the test consistently verifies both `canLike()` and `canComment()`, and the pattern of asserting permissions is coherent with the rest of the test, the most semantically consistent resolution is to preserve the `assertTrue(comments.getCanComment());` line from the HEAD branch.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getComments());
    Comments comments = exampleRating.getComments();
    assertEquals("chronological", comments.getOrder());
    assertEquals(1L, comments.getTotalCount().longValue());
    assertTrue(comments.getCanComment());

    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getLikes());
    Likes likes = exampleRating.getLikes();
    assertEquals(0L, likes.getTotalCount().longValue());
    assertTrue(likes.getCanLike());
```
