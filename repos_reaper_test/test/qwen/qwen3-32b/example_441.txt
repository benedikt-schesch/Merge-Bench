Here's the resolved merge conflict where both sides aim to update the behavior of the `focusOnField` method, either by updating a text helper or requesting focus to a field via an overloaded method:

```java
        securityCodeText.setOnFocusChangeListener(l);
        zipCodeText.setOnFocusChangeListener(l);
    }

    public void focusOnField(final CreditEntryFieldBase field) {
        focusOnField(field, null);
    }

    public void focusOnField(final CreditEntryFieldBase field, String initialFieldValue) {
        field.requestFocus();
        if(!scrolling) {
            scrolling = true;
``` 

Both sides are working toward a similar intent: improving or modifying the `focusOnField` method. One side attempts to update the helper text directly if available, while the other updates the method to be overloaded and delegates work to an updated version of `focusOnField` that accepts an additional parameter. Since the other side introduces this new overloaded method and the intent is clear, the correct resolution is to delegate the default one-parameter method to the two-parameter overload.
