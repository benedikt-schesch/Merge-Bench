The merge conflict arises from both branches introducing new dialog constants. Each branch's **intent** was to extend the set of dialog constants with their specific features. A manual merge requires ensuring no constant names collide and sequential numbering is preserved.

Here is the resolved version of the snippet with the merge applied:

```java
    static final int DIALOG_MESSAGE_CLICK = 25;
    static final int DIALOG_GOTO_PARENT = 28;
    static final int DIALOG_EDIT = 29;
    static final int DIALOG_DELETE = 30;
    static final int DIALOG_COMPOSE = 31;
    static final int DIALOG_FIND = 32; // from HEAD
    static final int DIALOG_REPORT = 33; // from 5b113d182581d1ed140bc7768a508344f19d7d6e
    static final int DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK = 34;
    static final int DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE = 35;

    // progress dialogs
    static final int DIALOG_LOGGING_IN = 1000;
    static final int DIALOG_SUBMITTING = 1004;
    static final int DIALOG_REPLYING = 1005;
```

### Resolution Summary

- Both branches added new dialog constants to the set.
- The "HEAD" branch added `DIALOG_FIND = 32` (immediately after `DIALOG_COMPOSE = 31`).
- The other branch added three new entries starting at 33, clearly intending a contiguous extension.
- The merged result assigns all constants unique, sequential values without overlap or ambiguity.
