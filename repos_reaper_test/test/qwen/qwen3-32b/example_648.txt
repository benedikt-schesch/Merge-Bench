Here's the resolved code snippet based on the more comprehensive description of supported attachment types in the merge conflict:

```java
  @Setter
  @Facebook("comments")
  private Comments comments;

  /**
   * Attachment (image, link, album, video) added to a comment.
   *
   * To force Facebook to fill the <code>attachment</code> field you have to fetch the comment with the
   * <code>fields=attachment</code> parameter, otherwise the attachments are <code>null</code>.
   *
   * @return Attachment on the comment
```

The conflict was resolved by taking the broader definition from the `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` commit which includes multiple attachment types, while retaining the unchanged parts of the documentation from both branches. The line from the other branch expands on the original "image" type to include "link, album, video" which aligns with Facebook's API capabilities for comment attachments.
