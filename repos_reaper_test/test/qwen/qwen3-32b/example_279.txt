I'll return the entire snippet with the conflict preserved, as the intent is ambiguous between the two branches:

```java
            toPkgr.addPackager(cpkgr);
            pkCount = 1;
        }

        toPkgr.setSameMapKeyType(isSameKeyType);
<<<<<<< HEAD

        if (pkCount != total) {
            int errCode = 2146;
            String msg = "Internal Error. Inconsistency in key index found during optimization.";
            throw new OptimizerException(msg, errCode, PigException.BUG);
        }
```

The conflict involves a method call to `setSameMapKeyType()` being added in one branch (HEAD) that isn't present in the other branch. While we know both branches share the same validation logic at the end of the snippet, we can't determine whether there's any semantic conflict in this specific case without more context from the other branch. The line appears to be standalone, but it's too close to the validation block for us to safely determine its correct placement without additional information.
