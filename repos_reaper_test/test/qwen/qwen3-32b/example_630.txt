Here is the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict incorporated:

```java
    if (compatFields != null && fields == null) {
      fields = new ArrayList<SubscriptionField>();
      for (String field : compatFields) {
        fields.add(new SubscriptionField(field));
      }
    } else if (compatFields == null && fields != null) {
      compatFields = new ArrayList<String>();
      for (SubscriptionField subscriptionField : fields) {
        compatFields.add(subscriptionField.getName());
      }
    }
  }

  public static class SubscriptionField extends AbstractFacebookType {


```

### Resolution Explanation:
- **Conflict Type**: The two branches implemented symmetric bidirectional compatibility conversions between `compatFields` (String list) and `fields` (object list).
- **Context**:
  - `HEAD` added conversion from `compatFields` to `fields` when `fields` was null.
  - The merged branch added the reverse conversion from `fields` to `compatFields` when `compatFields` was null.
- **Semantics**:
  - The conditions are mutually exclusive (`compatFields != null && fields == null` vs `compatFields == null && fields != null`), forming a proper `if-else` chain.
  - Both branches aimed to ensure compatibility in both directions, and the resolution simply combines these two orthogonal cases.
- **Conclusion**: No ambiguity or conflict in intent â€“ the code now handles both compatibility scenarios.
