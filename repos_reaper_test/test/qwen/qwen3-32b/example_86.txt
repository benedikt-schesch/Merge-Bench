Here is the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict resolved:

```java
  public String getPassword() {
    return password;
  }

  public void updateGameSettings(final int newScoreGoal, final int newMaxPlayers,
      final int newMaxSpectators, final Set<CardSet> newCardSets, final int newMaxBlanks, final String newPassword,
      final boolean newUseTimer) {
    this.scoreGoal = newScoreGoal;
    this.maxPlayers = newMaxPlayers;
    this.maxSpectators = newMaxSpectators;
    this.maxBlanks = newMaxBlanks;
    synchronized (this.cardSets) {
      this.cardSets.clear();
```

The conflict was resolved by:
1. Preserving the `newMaxSpectators` parameter from the `4584f06` branch, added between `newMaxPlayers` and `newCardSets`
2. Preserving the `newMaxBlanks` parameter from the `HEAD` branch, which was added after `newCardSets` and before `newPassword`
3. Adding missing assignments `this.maxSpectators = newMaxSpectators` and `this.maxBlanks = newMaxBlanks`

This maintains the semantic intent of both changes: adding spectator limits and blanks limits to game settings while preserving the existing settings parameters.
