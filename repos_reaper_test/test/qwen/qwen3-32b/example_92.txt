The merge conflict involves two different implementations of the same `handle` method in the given method definition. The conflict arises from subtle differences in the initialization of the `HashMap<ReturnableData, Object>` and the population of the map with chat status indicators.

---

- **HEAD Version**: Initializes the map using Java's diamond operator (`new HashMap<>()`), which is a concise and modern syntax. The code thereafter only adds `GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED`.
  
- **Conflicted Version (ed08e3719785...)**: Initializes the map using explicit generic bounds (`new HashMap<ReturnableData, Object>()`), a more verbose style that functionally matches the diamond operator. It also adds `GAME_CHAT_ENABLED` to the map.

Both versions aim to create a response map for an AJAX handler. The key difference is in the initialization of the `HashMap` and the inclusion of `GAME_CHAT_ENABLED`. Since these are stylistic and the semantic addition (in `GAME_CHAT_ENABLED`) is needed, **the correct resolution is to keep the diamond syntax from the HEAD and augment the map to also include `GAME_CHAT_ENABLED` as the conflicted branch does.**

Here is the correctly resolved code snippet in markdown format:

```java
    this.userPermalinkFormatString = userPermalinkFormatString;
  }

  @Override
  public Map<ReturnableData, Object> handle(final RequestWrapper request,
                                            final HttpSession session) {
    final HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> ret = new HashMap<>();
    ret.put(AjaxResponse.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED, gameChatEnabled);
    ret.put(AjaxResponse.GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED, globalChatEnabled);

    if (banList.contains(request.getRemoteAddr())) {
      LOG.info(String.format("Rejecting user from %s because they are banned.",
              request.getRemoteAddr()));
```
