The merge conflict occurs in the import statements. Both changesets have added `java.util.Map` but in different parts of the import block. The conflict also introduces one-time imports for `OutputStream`, `PrintStream`, and `Collection`. 

While `Map` appears in both, Java only requires one import for `java.util.Map`, so including it once is sufficient. `OutputStream` and `PrintStream` from `java.io` and `Collection` from `java.util` are distinct additions and should be preserved, as they represent independent functional requirements.

Here is the resolved snippet with all necessary imports preserved in a non-duplicated and logically ordered form:

```java
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.util.Collection;

import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.OperatorPlan;
import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.VisitorException;
import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.PlanException;
```

This resolution preserves all import dependencies that both sides of the merge likely required, assuming each side needed `OutputStream`, `PrintStream` for output operations, and `Collection` for collection processing, with `Map` being a redundant but likely harmless addition in both.
