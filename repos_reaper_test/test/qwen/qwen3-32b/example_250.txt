    @SuppressWarnings({ "unchecked", "rawtypes" })

    public List<InputSplit> getSplits(JobContext jobcontext)
                        throws IOException, InterruptedException {

        Configuration conf = jobcontext.getConfiguration();

```

The merge conflict only involves whitespace/diff formatting preferences for the method signature. Both versions declare the method with identical parameters (JobContext jobcontext) and throw identical checked exceptions (IOException, InterruptedException). The @SuppressWarnings and @Override annotations are also preserved in both versions. The semantic intent is purely stylistic - the first branch keeps the parameter on the same line as the method declaration but indents the throws clause 20 characters from the start, while the second branch places the throws clause 8 characters from the start but keeps the parameter on the same line as the method declaration. Since the functional behavior and implementation are identical between both versions, the conflict can be safely resolved by maintaining the same method signature structure as HEAD.
