Here is the resolved snippet with the merge conflict resolved by combining both sets of imports:

```java
package org.jbake.app;

import org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;
import org.hamcrest.BaseMatcher;
import org.hamcrest.Description;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes;
import org.jbake.util.DataFileUtil;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.jbake.model.ModelAttributes;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.BeforeClass;
import org.junit.Test;
```

The resolution combines both sets of imported classes as they represent distinct but complementary concerns (document types/utilities vs. model attributes). These imports do not conflict semantically and can coexist in the test class without issues.
