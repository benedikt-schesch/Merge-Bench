Here is the resolved merge conflict with combined intent and preserved context:

```java
  /* Begin public constants */
  public static final Pattern AT_SIGNS = Pattern.compile("[" + AT_SIGNS_CHARS + "]");

  public static final Pattern SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END = Pattern.compile("^(?:[" + AT_SIGNS_CHARS + LATIN_ACCENTS_CHARS + "]|://)");

  public static final Pattern AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS = Pattern.compile("(^|[^&/" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS + "])(#|\uFF03)(" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*" + HASHTAG_ALPHA + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*)", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE | Pattern.UNICODE_CASE);

  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_BEFORE = 1;
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_HASH = 2;
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_TAG = 3;
  public static final Pattern HASHTAG_MATCH_END = Pattern.compile("^(?:[#ï¼ƒ]|://)");
```

The resolution:

1. Preserved the new `SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END` pattern from the merge branch as a logical precursor
2. Combined both branches' changes to `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS` by:
   - Integrating the corrected character class with proper accented characters
   - Merging the case sensitivity flags with `|` (bitwise OR)
3. Retained all original constants and whitespace unchanged
4. Preserved the structural intent of improved Unicode handling while maintaining case insensitivity

The key semantic intent of Unicode support was added from the merge branch, while the original case insensitivity was maintained, creating a more comprehensive case handling solution.
