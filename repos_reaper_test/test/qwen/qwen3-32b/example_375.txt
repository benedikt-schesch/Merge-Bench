The conflict is between the `@Beta` annotation and an empty line from the other branch. The `@Beta` annotation suggests the method is in a beta phase and may change, while the other branch likely removed the annotation (possibly deprecating the beta label or aligning with a different API policy). Since the intent behind the removal is ambiguous and the `@Beta` annotation directly affects method semantics, we preserve the conflict to avoid potential unintended behavioral changes.

Below is the unchanged code snippet with the merge conflict markers preserved:

```java
   * @param certAndKey Certificate and private key input stream. The stream should contain one
   *     certificate and one unencrypted private key. If there are multiple certificates, only the
   *     first certificate will be used.
   * @return keystore for mutual TLS.
