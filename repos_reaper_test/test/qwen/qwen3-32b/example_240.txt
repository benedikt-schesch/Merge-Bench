Here's the resolved code snippet with the conflict markers removed:

```java
package org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collection;
```

The semantic analysis shows that:
1. The original code is importing `FileOutputStream` from `java.io`
2. The conflicting change is adding imports for `OutputStream` and `reflect.Method`
3. These imports appear to serve different purposes and are likely needed for separate functionalities (file operations vs stream manipulation vs reflection)

Since both changes are adding needed imports that don't conflict semantically (they are all valid imports needed for different aspects of I/O handling and reflection), I preserved all the required imports without duplication. The spacing and ordering has been maintained as requested.
