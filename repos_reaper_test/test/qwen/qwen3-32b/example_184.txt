The resolved code should use `StringBuilder` as it is not in a multi-threaded context.  
The intent is to efficiently build a string from remaining arguments, and `StringBuilder` is appropriate for single-threaded scenarios.

```java
            return;

        case STRING: {
            // Gather up all the remaining arguments into a string and pass them into
            // grunt.
<<<<<<< HEAD
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
=======
            // Resolved: Using StringBuilder for single-threaded string construction.
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

            String remainders[] = opts.getRemainingArgs();
            for (int i = 0; i < remainders.length; i++) {
                if (i != 0) sb.append(' ');
                sb.append(remainders[i]);
            }

```
