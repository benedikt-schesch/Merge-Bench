Here is the resolved code snippet with the conflict resolved by combining both unregistration attempts while preserving context:

```java
        try {
            getActivity().unregisterReceiver(videoUpdateReceiver);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            // do nothing
        }
        try {
            getActivity().unregisterReceiver(libraryUpdateReceiver);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            // do nothing
        }
        super.onStop();
    }

    @Override
    public void onAddClicked(CharSequence user, CharSequence password,

```

### Resolution Logic:
- **Intent Analysis**: Both branches aim to safely remove a broadcast receiver in `onStop()`. 
  - The `HEAD` change handles `videoUpdateReceiver`.
  - The `308db82053` change adds a new `libraryUpdateReceiver`.
- **Merge Strategy**: Since the receivers are distinct and the error handling is intentional for both, combining both try-catch blocks preserves both changes without altering their purpose or the surrounding method flow.
- **Structural Integrity**: Spacing, method placement (`super.onStop();`), and the start of `onAddClicked` are preserved exactly as in the original context.
