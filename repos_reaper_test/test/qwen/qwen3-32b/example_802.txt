The merge conflict arises because two branches are initializing `batched_rpcs` in the same `if (batched_rpcs == null)` block but with semantically different constructor calls. The `HEAD` branch introduces a constructor that requires `server_version` as a parameter, while the `other` branch initializes `batched_rpcs` using a no-argument constructor and then adds callbacks and flush scheduling logic.

**Resolution:**  
The intent of the `HEAD` branch is to pass `server_version` to the `MultiAction` constructor for compatibility with a newer API or logic that depends on it. The `other` branch’s code adds logic to register callbacks and schedule a flush when `batched_rpcs` is initialized. Since constructors and required parameters are critical to ensure correctness, the constructor using `server_version` from `HEAD` should be adopted, and the `other` branch’s additional logic (callbacks and flush scheduling) should be preserved. These lines are independent of the constructor choice and were likely part of the same initialization responsibility in both branches.

### ✅ Final Resolved Snippet:
```java
    MultiAction batch;
    boolean schedule_flush = false;

    synchronized (this) {
      if (batched_rpcs == null) {
        batched_rpcs = new MultiAction(server_version);
        addMultiActionCallbacks(batched_rpcs);
        schedule_flush = true;
      }
      batch = batched_rpcs;
      // Unfortunately we have to hold the monitor on `this' while we do
```
