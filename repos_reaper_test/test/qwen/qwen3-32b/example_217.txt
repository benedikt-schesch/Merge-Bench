Here is the resolved code snippet with the conflict resolved by integrating the PigServer initialization and setup from the merge branch:

```java
    @Test
    public void testStringLte() throws Throwable {
        PigServer pig = new PigServer(initString);
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
        PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(tmpFile));
        int expectedCount = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < LOOP_COUNT; i++) {
            if(i % 5 == 0) {
                ps.println("x");
                expectedCount++;
            }
        }
        ps.close();

        String relationName = "A";
        pig.registerQuery("A = load '" + tmpFile.getAbsolutePath() + "' using PigStorage();");
        pig.registerQuery("B = filter A by $0 <= 'zzz';");
        Iterator<Tuple> it = pig.openIterator("B");
        int count = 0;
        while (it.hasNext()) {
            it.next();
            count++;
        }
        
        assertEquals(expectedCount, count);
    }
```

The key semantic resolution steps:
1. Added required `PigServer` initialization from the merge branch
2. Maintained the test's original structure for setting up temporary files, counting expected values, running the query, and verifying results
3. Preserved all the original loop logic and assertion mechanism
