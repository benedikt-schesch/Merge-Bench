Here is the resolved code snippet with the conflict resolved by keeping the other branch's formatting of splitting the `setDuration` call:

```java
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
        animate().translationX(params.leftMargin).setDuration(
                SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
    }

    public void hideWidgets() {
        mIsHidden = true;
```

Both sides of the conflict were semantically equivalent, differing only in formatting. The other branch's version uses a line break and indentation for the `setDuration` parameter, which is often preferred for readability, so its style was preserved.
