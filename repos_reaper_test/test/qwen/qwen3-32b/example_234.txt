Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict resolved by merging both lines:

```java
 * contains the line of text.
 */
public class TextLoader implements LoadFunc{
    BufferedPositionedInputStream in;
    final private static Charset utf8 = Charset.forName("UTF8");
    long                end;
    private TupleFactory mTupleFactory = TupleFactory.getInstance();

    public void bindTo(String fileName, BufferedPositionedInputStream in, long offset, long end) throws IOException {
        this.in = in;
        this.end = end;
        // Since we are not block aligned we throw away the first
```

The conflict was resolved by combining the variable declarations from both branches (preserving the original indentation style of the `end` variable while appending the new `mTupleFactory` declaration). Both parties appear to be adding class fields, and this approach maintains consistency in formatting while incorporating both changes.
