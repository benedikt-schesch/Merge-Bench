The conflict arises from a change in the `onLoadResources` method, which was updated to use `BitmapTextureAtlas` instead of `BitmapTexture`. The intent of both versions is to initialize a texture for the font, but the `BitmapTextureAtlas` likely represents a shift toward using a texture atlas system (common in many game engines for optimization). The `FontFactory.createFromAsset` method is designed to work with texture atlases in some frameworks (e.g., AndEngine), so resolving in favor of `BitmapTextureAtlas` aligns with updated semantics.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
		return new LimitedFPSEngine(engineOptions, FPS);
	}

	@Override
	public void onLoadResources() {
		this.mScoreFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);

		FontFactory.setAssetBasePath("font/");
		this.mScoreFont = FontFactory.createFromAsset(this.mScoreFontTexture, this, "LCD.ttf", 32, true, Color.WHITE);

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mScoreFontTexture);
```
