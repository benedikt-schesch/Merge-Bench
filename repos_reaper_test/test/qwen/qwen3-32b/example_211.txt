The merge conflict appears in the license header section of the code. Both sides are attempting to add their respective Apache license texts. The `HEAD` contains the Apache 2.0 license lines, and the other commit adds the Apache 1.1 license header. Since the intent is ambiguous (project-specific decision on which license to adopt), the conflict remains unresolved. Neither side is removed to avoid unintended overrides.
