```java
	@Override
	protected User getContextItemUser(int position) {
		// position = position - 1;
		Log.d(TAG, "list position:" + position);
		// 加入footer跳过footer
		if (position >=0 && position < mUserListAdapter.getCount()) {

			User item = (User) mUserListAdapter.getItem(position);
			if (item == null) {
				return null;
			} else {

```

The merged condition `position >=0 && position < mUserListAdapter.getCount()` combines both semantic intents:
- **Safety from invalid indices**: The `position >=0` check prevents negative indices (added by the other branch)
- **Check within adapter bounds**: The `position < getCount()` ensures we don't exceed adapter size (present in both branches)

This resolves the conflict by adopting the safer condition from the other branch while preserving the core functionality from both versions. The commented-out `position = position -1` line suggests there may be additional context about footer handling, but no conflicting changes exist in that area.
