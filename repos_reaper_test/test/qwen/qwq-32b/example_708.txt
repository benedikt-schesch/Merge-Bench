				throw new JSONException(e.getLocalizedMessage());
			}

			String jsonString = doGet("id+name+url+duration/playlist/json/playlist_user/?order=starred_desc&user_idstr="+user);

	@Override

<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Rationale:
#### First Conflict Resolution:
The two branches had conflicting implementations of an exception handling block. The merged branch added **functionality** to return parsed playlists by making an API call with specific parameters, which is semantically clearer and logically sound. The original "return null" was replaced to include this active API call and parsing. This choice retains the method's purpose to retrieve playlists rather than fallback to null immediately after exception handling.

#### Second Conflict Status:
The second conflict involves the `getPlaylist` method where the branch to merge has no content provided (only the `<<<<<<< HEAD` marker). Since the intent of the other side's contribution here is unknown (no `>>>>>>>` followed by their changes in the provided snippet), this part cannot be resolved safely and remains as a conflict. The user should inspect the history or communicate with the other developer to resolve this.
