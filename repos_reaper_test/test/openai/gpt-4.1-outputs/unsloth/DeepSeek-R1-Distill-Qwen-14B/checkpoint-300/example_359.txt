```java
   * parameter is the declared field class. Declared fields of type {@link Collection} are used to
   * support repeating data key names, so each member of the collection is an additional data key
   * value. They are parsed the same as "primitive" fields, except that the generic type parameter
   * of the collection is used as the {@link Class} parameter.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
