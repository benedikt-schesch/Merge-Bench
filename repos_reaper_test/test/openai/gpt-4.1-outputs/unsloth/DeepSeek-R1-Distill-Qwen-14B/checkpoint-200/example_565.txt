  @Test
  public void checkIterator_reachAllElements() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();

    // Both sides are checking for not null, using assertThat (from HEAD) is more expressive and likely the preferred style if the rest of the code uses it.
    assertThat(connection).isNotNull();

    int counter = 0;
    for (List<FacebookType> page : connection) {
      for (FacebookType type : page) {
