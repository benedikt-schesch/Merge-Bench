Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The test method checkContentTypeBytes_html has two different assertions. The HEAD version uses assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html"), while the other side uses assertEquals("text/html", att.getContentType()). 

I need to figure out the intent here. Both are checking the content type of the attachment. The HEAD uses an assertion from a library like AssertJ, which is more fluent. The other side uses JUnit's assertEquals. 

Since both are valid but different styles, maybe the project prefers one style over the other. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the method names are the same, so it's a conflict in the assertion approach.

If the goal is to keep both changes, that's impossible because they're conflicting in the same line. So I need to choose one. But the user said to resolve semantically. Are these two assertions equivalent? Yes, both check that the content type is text/html. 

If the project uses AssertJ, keeping the HEAD version makes sense. If they're switching to JUnit's assertions, the other side is better. But since I don't know the project's context, maybe the correct resolution is to pick one. Alternatively, perhaps the test was modified in both branches to do the same thing but with different syntax. 

Since the user said to resolve based on intent and semantics, and both achieve the same goal, perhaps the correct approach is to pick the most recent change or the one that's more idiomatic. However, without knowing project guidelines, it's ambiguous. 

But the user instruction says if unsure, leave the conflict. Wait, the user said if unsure or intent is ambiguous, return the same snippet with conflict. But here, both assertions are correct but different styles. The intent is the same, so maybe we can resolve it by choosing one. But which one?

Alternatively, maybe the codebase uses a mix, but that's unlikely. Since the conflict is in the same test, perhaps the correct resolution is to use the AssertJ version if that's the project's standard. But without knowing, it's risky. 

Wait, the user is asking to resolve semantically. Since both are asserting the same thing, perhaps either is acceptable. But the merge conflict requires choosing one. 

Alternatively, maybe the two assertions are not exactly the same. The AssertJ method might be doing a different check, like checking the content type via a method, whereas the assertEquals is checking the string directly. Are they equivalent? If att.getContentType() returns "text/html", then both are the same. 

Assuming that both are correct, the resolver should pick the one that's intended. But since the user hasn't provided more context, perhaps the best way is to choose the HEAD version, or the other. Alternatively, maybe the correct resolution is to use the assertEquals version if that's the intended assertion. 

But since the user hasn't given info on the project's testing framework, it's ambiguous. Therefore, according to the instructions, if not sure, return the same snippet with conflict. Wait, but the user said if the intent is ambiguous, return the conflict. But in this case, the intent is the sameâ€”checking content type. The conflict is in the assertion style. So maybe the resolution is to pick one. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the HEAD version because it's more descriptive. Or maybe the other branch is a correction. 

Wait, the test name is checkContentTypeBytes_html(), so both assertions are valid. The conflict is stylistic. Since the user is a semantic merge expert, they need to determine which assertion correctly captures the intent. 

If both are correct, then the conflict can be resolved by choosing either. But without project-specific info, it's hard. However, the user's instruction says to resolve based on intent and semantics. Since the semantic intent is the same, perhaps either is acceptable, but the conflict needs to be resolved. 

Alternatively, maybe one of the assertions is wrong. For example, maybe hasContentType checks MIME type via some logic, while getContentType() returns a string. But if both are correct, then the conflict is just stylistic. 

In such cases, the resolver should pick the one that's more up-to-date or the one that's part of the current branch. But since the user hasn't provided that context, perhaps the best approach is to present the resolved version by choosing one. However, the user's instruction says to return the resolved code only if sure. 

Wait, the user's instruction says: "If you are not sure on how to resolve the conflict or if the intent is ambiguous, please return the same snippet with the conflict."

In this case, the intent is the same (check content type), but the way of asserting is different. The conflict is due to different testing styles. Since the resolver can't be sure which style the project uses, the intent is not ambiguous, but the resolution depends on project conventions. Therefore, the resolver might not be sure, so they should leave the conflict. 

But wait, the user says to think in terms of intent and semantics. Both sides are trying to assert the content type is text/html. So semantically, they are the same. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by choosing either. 

But how to choose between the two? If the project uses AssertJ, then the HEAD version is better. If it uses JUnit's assertEquals, then the other. 

But without knowing, perhaps the resolver should prefer the HEAD version. Alternatively, the resolver could recognize that both are valid and pick one. 

Alternatively, maybe the two changes are from different developers changing the assertion style. Since the tests are otherwise the same, the correct resolution is to pick one. 

But according to the problem statement, the user wants the entire snippet with the conflict resolved if possible. Since the intent is the same, the resolver should resolve the conflict by choosing one of the assertions. 

But how? The answer would be to pick one line and remove the conflict markers. 

But which one? Since the user is an expert, maybe they should recognize that both are correct and perhaps the latest change (the a17acec commit) is the correct one. But without that info, it's hard. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the assertEquals version because it's more direct. Or maybe the assertThat version is better because it's part of a fluent API and provides better error messages. 

In the absence of project-specific info, but knowing that both are correct, the resolver should pick one. However, the user's instruction says to resolve based on semantics. Since the semantic is the same, either is acceptable. 

But the user's example shows that the code after resolution should have one of the two lines. Therefore, the correct resolution is to pick either. 

But in practice, perhaps the resolver would choose the version that's more modern or commonly used. AssertJ's assertThat is often preferred for richer assertions. 

So, the resolved code would be:

    assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html");

But the original conflict is between that line and the assertEquals. 

Alternatively, maybe the test was changed from assertEquals to assertThat in one branch, and the other branch didn't have that change. So merging would require keeping the assertThat. 

In the given code, the HEAD version is the assertThat, and the other branch is the assertEquals. 

If the HEAD is the main branch, and the other branch is a feature branch that hasn't updated to the new assertion style, then the correct resolution is to keep the HEAD version. 

Alternatively, if the other branch is correcting a mistake, like using the correct method, then we should take that. 

But without context, it's impossible to know. 

Therefore, according to the problem's instructions, if the intent is clear, resolve it. Otherwise, leave the conflict. 

In this case, the intent is the same, so the conflict can be resolved by choosing either. But the problem says to return the resolved code if possible. 

So, the expert would pick one. Since the user is asking for a resolution, and the conflict is in the assertion style, but the semantic is the same, the expert might choose the assertThat line, assuming that the project uses AssertJ. 

Therefore, the resolved code would be the HEAD version.</think>
