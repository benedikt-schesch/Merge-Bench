Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict between the HEAD branch and the branch from commit 3c868cbe. 

Looking at the conflict markers:

<<<<<<< HEAD
	protected ModuleRootManager moduleRootManager;
=======
	protected ModuleSettings moduleSettings;
	protected RuntimeEnvironment runtimeEnvironment;
>>>>>>> 3c868cbe67875b5515d13bd8b8237e13dd2f9c32

So the HEAD branch adds ModuleRootManager, while the other branch adds ModuleSettings and RuntimeEnvironment. 

The goal is to merge both changes without losing any necessary fields. Since these are variable declarations in a class, they might be independent. The conflict arises because both branches added different variables in the same spot. 

The correct resolution would be to include all three variables: ModuleRootManager, ModuleSettings, and RuntimeEnvironment. The order might matter, but since the original code had them in a certain order, maybe the HEAD's addition is first, followed by the other two. 

So combining both by adding all three lines should resolve the conflict. There's no obvious semantic overlap here; both sides are adding different dependencies. Therefore, the merged code should include all three fields.</think>

	protected MessageBusConnection messageBusConnection;
	protected ProjectFileIndex projectFileIndex;
	protected ProjectRootManager projectRootManager; 
	
	protected InfinitestLauncher launcher;
	protected ModuleRootManager moduleRootManager;
	protected ModuleSettings moduleSettings;
	protected RuntimeEnvironment runtimeEnvironment;
	protected ProjectTestControl control;
	protected InfinitestAnnotator annotator;
	
	@BeforeEach
	public void setupIntellijMockBase() {
