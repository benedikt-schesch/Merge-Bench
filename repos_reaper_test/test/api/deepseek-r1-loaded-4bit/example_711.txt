Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The user provided a Java code snippet with a conflict between the HEAD and another branch. The conflict is around adding a CHUNK_SIZE constant.

In the HEAD version, the code has the FALSE and TRUE constants, then goes straight into the Holder class. The other branch adds the CHUNK_SIZE constant right after TRUE. 

The task is to resolve this conflict by understanding the intent of both sides. Both constants FALSE and TRUE are static finals, and CHUNK_SIZE is another static final. Since they're all public static final ints, it makes sense that they should be grouped together. 

The conflict arises because one branch added CHUNK_SIZE after TRUE, and the other branch didn't have it. The correct resolution would be to include CHUNK_SIZE in the list of constants, maintaining the order. There's no overlap or logical reason to exclude it. So, merging them by placing CHUNK_SIZE after TRUE and before the Holder class should resolve the conflict without issues. The spacing seems consistent, so just keep the new constant in place.</think>
```java
    public static final int FALSE = 0;

    public static final int TRUE = 1;
    public static final int CHUNK_SIZE = 50;

    private static class Holder {

        private static final DatabaseHelper instance = new DatabaseHelper();

    }
```

Explanation: Both constants `TRUE`/`FALSE` and `CHUNK_SIZE` are clearly meant to be public static final int declarations. They logically belong together as configuration constants, and there's no semantic overlap between these declarations. The conflict is simply additive - one branch added `TRUE`/`FALSE` while another added `CHUNK_SIZE`. The resolution maintains all declarations in a coherent group before the Holder class definition.
