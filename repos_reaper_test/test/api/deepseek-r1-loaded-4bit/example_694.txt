Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict between the HEAD and the other branch (d72e83e). 

Looking at the conflict, the HEAD version adds a new case "inline-text-message" which appends some data attributes related to failure notifications delay. The other branch seems to remove this case. 

I need to determine if these changes are compatible or if they conflict. If the other branch deleted the "inline-text-message" case, but the HEAD added it, maybe the deletion was accidental, or perhaps the other branch had a reason to remove it.

But wait, looking closer, the conflict markers show that the HEAD added the case and the other branch removed it. So the conflict arises because one branch added code that the other branch didn't have. Since both changes are in the same part of the code, Git can't merge them automatically.

To resolve this, I need to check if both changes are intended. If the "inline-text-message" case is still valid and needed, we should keep it. Alternatively, if the other branch's deletion was intentional (maybe the feature was removed), then we should remove it.

However, the user instructions say to think about the intent and semantics of both sides. If the other branch's commit message isn't provided, it's hard to know why the case was removed. But given the context, maybe the other branch was cleaning up or removing a feature, while the HEAD was adding a new feature. 

Alternatively, perhaps the other branch's deletion is just a mistake. Without more context, it's safer to assume that both changes are valid. But since they conflict, the correct resolution would be to keep both changes if possible. However, in this case, the other branch is deleting the code that HEAD added. So it's a true conflict.

Wait, maybe the other branch didn't delete the case. Let me look again. The conflict is between the HEAD adding the case and the other branch not having it. Wait, the other branch's code is just removing the case. So the lines between <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= are from the current branch (HEAD), and the lines between ======= and >>>>>>> are from the other branch.

In the HEAD, after the "fire-event" case, there's a break, then a new case "inline-text-message" with some code. The other branch doesn't have that caseâ€”it just ends the "fire-event" case and breaks, then the default case.

So the conflict is because the HEAD added a new case, and the other branch didn't. If the other branch's code doesn't touch that part, maybe the conflict is because of a merge order. Alternatively, perhaps the other branch removed the case that HEAD added. But without knowing the intent, it's hard.

The user instruction says if unsure, leave the conflict. But if I can figure out that both changes can coexist, then merge them. However, in this case, the other branch is deleting the code that HEAD added. So if the other branch's commit is more recent, maybe the code should be removed. But since both are conflicting, it's unclear.

Wait, maybe the other branch is older. The commit hash d72e83e might be an older commit. If the HEAD is adding the "inline-text-message" case after the other branch was created, then the correct resolution is to keep the HEAD's addition. But if the other branch intentionally removed that case, then it's a conflict.

But since the user says to preserve both intents if possible. However, in this case, they can't both be preserved because one adds and the other removes. Therefore, the correct resolution depends on which change is intended to be kept.

But without more context, perhaps the user intended to add the "inline-text-message" case, and the other branch's deletion was a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the other branch correctly removed obsolete code.

Given the user's instruction to resolve based on semantics and intent, perhaps the "inline-text-message" case is needed, and the other branch's deletion is incorrect. Therefore, the resolved code would keep the case from HEAD. Alternatively, if the other branch's deletion is correct, then remove it.

But since the user hasn't provided commit messages or context, I'm not sure. If I have to make a decision, maybe the "inline-text-message" case is a valid addition and should be kept. So the resolved code would include that case, thus choosing the HEAD version and ignoring the other branch's deletion.

Therefore, the conflict markers should be removed, and the case from HEAD should remain. The final code would have both the "fire-event" case and the "inline-text-message" case.</think>
