Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java constructor. Let's look at what both sides are doing.

The HEAD version simply assigns the input stream 'in' to 'this.in'. The other branch, from commit 1488b22, has a more complex approach. It checks if 'in' is an instance of CBZip2InputStream. If so, it directly assigns it, else it wraps it in a BufferedInputStream with bufSize. The comment says not to buffer a bzip stream because it causes issues with split records.

So the intent here is that for CBZip2InputStream, we shouldn't buffer, but for others, we should. The HEAD version doesn't handle this special case, while the other branch does. The correct resolution would be to take the code from the branch that adds the conditional, as it's more specific and addresses a potential issue with bzip streams. The bufSize is already defined as 1024, so that's fine. Also, the 'pos' assignment is the same in both, so no conflict there. The surrounding context doesn't change, so I can merge the branch's code into the HEAD, keeping the conditional logic for CBZip2InputStream. That way, both the pos assignment and the proper handling of the input stream are preserved.</think>
```java
    long pos;
    InputStream in;
    final int bufSize = 1024;
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in, long pos) {
		// Don't buffer a bzip stream as it will cause problems for split
		// records.
		if (in instanceof CBZip2InputStream) this.in = in;
		else this.in = new BufferedInputStream(in, bufSize);
        this.pos = pos;
    }
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in){
        this(in,0);
```
