Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. So, looking at the code snippet, the conflict is in a Java test method. The HEAD version has the method declared as `@Test void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun()`, while the other branch (ee249315...) uses `@Test public void shouldSet...` with a different method name `prepareCore` instead of `prepateCore`.

First, I need to check the method name. The HEAD version has `prepateCore`, which might be a typo. The other branch uses `prepareCore`, which is likely the correct spelling. So the method name should be `prepareCore`.

Next, the method modifiers: HEAD uses `void` without `public`, and the other branch adds `public`. In JUnit 5 (JUnit Jupiter), test methods don't need to be public, so the `public` modifier is optional. The HEAD version probably follows JUnit 5 conventions, omitting `public`. The other branch might be using JUnit 4 or older style where `public` was required. Since the test class might be using JUnit 5, removing `public` is acceptable. But maybe the project's style requires `public` for tests. However, without more context, it's safer to go with JUnit 5's default, which doesn't require `public`. So the HEAD's version without `public` is preferable.

But wait, the other branch's change also fixes the method name. So the correct resolution would be to take the method name from the other branch (`prepareCore`) and keep the method modifier from HEAD (no `public`). Also, ensure that the test annotation is `@Test` as both sides have that.

So the resolved method declaration should be:

@Test
void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun() throws CoreException {
    InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 0);

That way, we correct the typo in the method name and maintain the JUnit 5 style without `public`. Both changes are semantically important: the method name fix is a correction, and the `public` modifier is unnecessary in JUnit 5. The rest of the context doesn't have conflicts, so the surrounding code remains as is.</think>
```java
		when(coreRegistry.getCore(projectAUri)).thenReturn(core);
		return core;
	}

	@Test
	void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun() throws CoreException {
		InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 0);

		workspace.updateProjects(Collections.singleton(resource));

		assertStatusIs(noTestsRun());
		verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));
```
