Okay, let's see what the user is asking here. They provided a Java code snippet with a merge conflict and want me to resolve it. The task is to look at the intent of both sides and merge them without changing the context. The conflict is between the HEAD version and a branch version, both ending the class with a closing brace.

Looking at the code, the conflict occurs right after the removeMessageTag method. Both sides have a closing curly brace for the class. The HEAD version has just "}", and the other side (a17acec) also has "}". So, they're identical. 

Wait, maybe there's a possibility of whitespace or some hidden characters? But in the given code, both sides are exactly the same. So this is a trivial conflict where both changes made the same modification. The correct resolution is to keep one instance of the closing brace, removing the conflict markers.

So the resolved code should have the method removeMessageTag, followed by a single closing brace. The conflict markers (<<<<<<< HEAD, =======, >>>>>>> a17acec...) should be removed. The surrounding context should remain unchanged, preserving spacing as is.</think>
```java
  }

  public void removeMessageTag(MessageTag messageTag) {
    messageTags.remove(messageTag);
  }
}
```
