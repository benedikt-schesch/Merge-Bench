Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The conflict is in the declaration of the 'deferred' field in a Java class. The HEAD version uses 'Deferred' without a type parameter, while the other branch uses 'Deferred<?>' with a wildcard. 

First, I need to understand what each side is doing. The HEAD version is using the raw type, which might be for backward compatibility or perhaps the original code didn't use generics. The other branch is parameterizing Deferred with a wildcard, which is a way of using generics without specifying a specific type. 

In Java, using raw types is generally discouraged because they bypass generic type checks. The Deferred class is likely a generic class, so using Deferred<?> is more correct as it explicitly states that the type is unspecified, which is better than using the raw type. 

The intent of both sides is to declare a Deferred instance. The conflict arises from whether to include the generic type. Since using generics is better practice and the wildcard doesn't enforce any specific type, merging to Deferred<?> would be the right choice. It maintains type safety without restricting the actual type used.

So, the resolution would be to pick the version with Deferred<?> because it's more type-safe and adheres to Java generics best practices. The surrounding context doesn't change, so the rest of the code remains the same.</think>
