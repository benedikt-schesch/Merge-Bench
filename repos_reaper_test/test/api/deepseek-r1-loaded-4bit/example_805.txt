Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The code in question is about registering different licenses. The HEAD version adds the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1, while the other branch adds the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported license. 

First, I need to understand the intent of both changes. Both seem to be adding new licenses to the list. Since they're adding different licenses, the correct resolution might be to include both. But I have to check if there's any reason they might conflict beyond just the order.

Looking at the existing licenses, they have Apache, BSD, ISC, MIT. Then the conflict arises. The order might not matter here, but maybe the user intended to add both. So the solution would be to keep both lines. 

Wait, but in the conflict markers, it's showing that HEAD has one line and the other branch has another. So the merge conflict is because both modified the same place. To resolve, we need to include both licenses. So the resolved code should have both registerLicense calls for GnuLesserGeneralPublicLicense21 and CreativeCommonsAttributionNoDerivs30Unported.

Therefore, the merged code should list both licenses. The order might not be important, but perhaps maintain the order from both branches. Since HEAD's addition comes first in the conflict, maybe keep that order. So the final code after the MIT line would have both lines added.</think>

        sLicenses.clear();
        registerLicense(new ApacheSoftwareLicense20());
        registerLicense(new BSD3ClauseLicense());
        registerLicense(new ISCLicense());
        registerLicense(new MITLicense());
        registerLicense(new GnuLesserGeneralPublicLicense21());
        registerLicense(new CreativeCommonsAttributionNoDerivs30Unported());
    }
