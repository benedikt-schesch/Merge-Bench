Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The conflict is in a Java method declaration. The HEAD version has the method as protected with parameters (PrintWriter, OptionHandler, int, ResourceBundle). The other branch has it as private with an additional OptionHandlerFilter parameter.

First, I need to understand the intent of both changes. The HEAD side might be adjusting the access modifier from private to protected, allowing subclasses to override or use this method. The other branch is adding a new parameter, which suggests a new feature or functionality that requires filtering options.

The challenge is merging these without losing functionality. If we make the method private as in the other branch, but keep the new parameter, that might break the HEAD's intention of making it protected. Alternatively, if we keep it protected but add the parameter, does that make sense?

Wait, looking at the code, the method in the other branch has the 'filter' parameter and uses it in the condition '!filter.select(handler)'. The HEAD version doesn't have this parameter, so the condition in HEAD is missing that part. That's a problem because the code after the merge would have the filter check only if the parameter is included.

So, the method's logic in the other branch includes a new check using 'filter', which is necessary for that branch's functionality. The HEAD branch changed the access modifier to protected but doesn't have the filter. To resolve this, we need to incorporate both changes: the protected access and the added parameter.

Therefore, the correct resolution would be to take the method signature from the other branch but change the access modifier to protected. That way, the new parameter is included (necessary for the filter check), and the method remains accessible to subclasses as intended by HEAD.

So the resolved method declaration should be:

protected void printOption(PrintWriter out, OptionHandler handler, int len, ResourceBundle rb, OptionHandlerFilter filter) {

This combines both the access modifier change and the new parameter. The context lines before and after the conflict markers should remain unchanged, and the code logic with the filter check is preserved.</think>

     * @param len      Maximum length of metadata column
     * @param rb       ResourceBundle for I18N
     * @see Setter#asAnnotatedElement()
     */
    protected void printOption(PrintWriter out, OptionHandler handler, int len, ResourceBundle rb, OptionHandlerFilter filter) {
    	// Hiding options without usage information
    	if (handler.option.usage() == null ||
            handler.option.usage().length() == 0 ||
            !filter.select(handler)) {
    		return;
```
