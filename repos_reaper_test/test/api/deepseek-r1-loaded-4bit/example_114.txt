Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The conflict is in the author list of a Java class. The HEAD version has "Olivier Michallat" and the other branch has "Olivier Demeijer". 

Hmm, the problem is that both branches are adding an author, but with different last names. Are these two different people, or is it a typo in one of the branches? Since the names are similar but not the same, it's possible that they're two different individuals. Alternatively, maybe one of the commits misspelled the name.

If both authors should be credited, the correct resolution would be to include both names. However, looking at the context, each @author line is for a single person. The conflict markers show that one line was modified in each branch. Wait, the conflict is between Olivier Michallat and Olivier Demeijer. Since they're on the same line in the conflict, it's a case where both branches modified the same line. 

But how do I know which one is correct? Without additional context, it's hard to tell. Maybe Olivier changed his name, or maybe one of the branches has a typo. Since I can't verify the correct name, the safest approach is to keep both, but that's not possible here because they're on the same line. Alternatively, perhaps one of the branches is more recent or correct. 

If I can't determine the correct author, the instruction says to return the same snippet with the conflict if unsure. So, since the intent is ambiguous and I don't have enough information to decide which Olivier is correct, I should leave the conflict as is. Therefore, the resolved code would keep the conflict markers because the intent isn't clear.</think>
