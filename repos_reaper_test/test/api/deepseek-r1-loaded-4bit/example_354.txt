Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. So, looking at the code snippet, there's a conflict between the HEAD and the other branch (47d0018). The conflict is in the test assertions after creating a GoogleJsonResponseException.

In the HEAD version, they're checking that responseException.getDetails() is null. Then they construct an expectedMessage with "403" followed by the URL and assert that the exception's message matches exactly.

On the other branch, they're checking that ge.getDetails() is null. Wait, ge might be a typo here because the variable is named responseException. That could be a mistake. Then they assert that the message starts with "403".

So first, I need to resolve the variable name. The correct variable is responseException, so the branch's ge.getDetails() is probably incorrect. So that line should be assertNull(responseException.getDetails());.

For the message assertion, the HEAD wants an exact match including the URL, while the other branch just checks the prefix. The exact message might be too brittle if the URL changes, but maybe that's intentional. Alternatively, checking the start with "403" is more flexible.

But since the tests might have different intents: one is ensuring the exact message format, the other is checking the status code. However, in the context of a merge conflict, we need to see if these can coexist or if one is an update to the other.

Wait, looking at the surrounding code, both are testing the same scenario. The conflict arises because both branches modified the same part. The correct resolution would be to combine both assertions if they're testing different aspects. But in the given code, the two branches have different assertions. The HEAD has assertEquals on the full message, while the other branch has assertTrue on startsWith.

Alternatively, maybe the intention is to check both that the details are null and that the message starts with 403. But the HEAD's exact message check might be more specific. However, the branch's change might be a fix if the exact message is not reliable.

But since the user wants to resolve the conflict by considering the semantics, maybe the best approach is to keep both assertions. Wait, but looking at the code, the two branches are replacing each other. The conflict markers show that the lines after responseException assignment are conflicting.

So the original code in HEAD was:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "403\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());

In the other branch, it's:

    assertNull(ge.getDetails());
    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

Assuming that 'ge' is a typo and should be 'responseException', then the corrected lines would be:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

But why did the other branch change from checking the exact message to just the prefix? Maybe the exact message was causing flakiness, or the URL part was removed in that branch. Alternatively, the exact message might have changed in one branch but not the other.

Alternatively, perhaps the two tests are for different scenarios. But looking at the surrounding code, the method here is testFrom() and the next method is testFrom_detailsErrorObject(). So the conflict is within the same test method.

Wait, the code after the conflict is in the same test method. So the two branches are modifying the same test. Therefore, we need to reconcile the assertions.

If the HEAD's assertion is more specific (exact message) and the other branch is a generalization (starts with 403), perhaps the latter is an improvement to make the test less brittle. Alternatively, maybe the exact message was incorrect in one branch.

But without more context, perhaps the correct approach is to take both assertions. Wait, but the two branches are modifying the same lines. The conflict is between the two sets of assertions. So the user has to choose which one to keep or combine.

But how? Let's see. The HEAD's code checks the exact message, which includes the URL. The other branch checks that the message starts with 403 and that details are null. However, the other branch uses 'ge' which is not definedâ€”probably a typo for 'responseException'.

Assuming that the other branch intended to use 'responseException', then perhaps the correct resolution is to keep both assertions: check that details are null and that the message starts with 403. But the exact message assertion in HEAD might conflict with that.

Wait, no. The HEAD's code checks the entire message, including the URL. The other branch's code checks that the message starts with 403. If we want both, we can have:

assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
String expectedMessage = "403\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

But that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe the other branch's change was to replace the exact check with a startsWith, perhaps because the exact message was changed elsewhere. For example, maybe the exception's message format was modified in the other branch, so the exact check would fail, hence the startsWith.

Alternatively, maybe the HEAD is an older version where the message included the URL, and the other branch is a newer version where the message is simplified to just start with 403, hence changing the assertion.

But without knowing the intent, it's hard. However, given the conflict, the correct resolution would be to take both changes, but since they are modifying the same lines, perhaps the best is to keep the assertNull and then choose either the exact message or the startsWith.

Alternatively, maybe the other branch's change is correcting a variable name (ge -> responseException) and changing the assertion. So the correct code would be:

assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

But the HEAD's code is creating an expectedMessage and asserting equals. So the conflict is between two different ways of checking the message.

Which one is correct? If both are valid, but the branches have different intentions, perhaps the user intended to check both, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the other branch's change is more correct, and the exact message check in HEAD is outdated.

Alternatively, maybe the two assertions can coexist. But since they are on consecutive lines, it's possible that one branch replaced the other's assertions.

Given that the user wants to resolve the conflict by considering the semantics, perhaps the correct approach is to take the most recent change or combine them. However, since the variable name in the other branch is 'ge' which is incorrect, that's a mistake. So the correct code should use 'responseException'.

So, merging the two, the resolved code should have:

assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

But the HEAD's code had the exact message. If the exact message is still correct, then the other branch's change might be a mistake. But maybe the other branch's change is to relax the assertion.

Alternatively, maybe the message in the exception now includes more details, so the exact check is no longer valid, hence the startsWith.

But without more context, it's challenging. However, given that the other branch's code has a typo (ge instead of responseException), that's likely an error, so the correct code from the other branch should fix that typo.

Therefore, the resolved code should have:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

But the original HEAD's code had a more specific check. So why the conflict?

Alternatively, maybe the other branch intended to check that the message starts with 403, while the HEAD checks the full message. If both are valid, perhaps the correct approach is to keep both assertions. However, that's unlikely since they are in conflict.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct resolution is to take the other branch's assertion but fix the variable name, and remove the exact check. Or, if the exact message is important, keep the HEAD's version.

But given that the user is a merge conflict resolution expert, they need to determine which change is more appropriate. Since the user says to think in terms of intent and semantics, perhaps the intent of the HEAD is to verify the exact error message structure, while the other branch is ensuring that the HTTP status code is present.

But combining both could be useful. For example, check that the message starts with 403 and also check the exact format. But that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe the exact message check is no longer valid, and the startsWith is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the other branch's change is a correction. For instance, maybe the exact message in the HEAD is incorrect because the URL might vary, making the test brittle. Therefore, the other branch's assertion is more robust.

In that case, the correct resolution would be to take the other branch's code but fix the variable name from 'ge' to 'responseException'.

So the resolved lines would be:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

Thus, replacing the HEAD's exact message check with a startsWith check and fixing the variable name in the other branch's assertion.

Therefore, the final merged code would have those two lines.</think>
