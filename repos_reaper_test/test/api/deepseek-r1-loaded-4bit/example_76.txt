Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the two versions. Both sides are adding a key-value pair to the data map. The difference is in the formatting of the line where data.put is called.

In the HEAD version, the line is split into two lines with the parameters on separate lines. The other side, from commit 5adedd2, has the same parameters on a single line. The actual content being added is identical: both use AjaxResponse.GAME_PERMALINK and the same String.format arguments. 

Since the only difference is code formatting, there's no semantic conflict here. The intent of both branches is the same. The best approach is to choose the version that follows the project's coding style. If the surrounding code uses line breaks for method arguments, then HEAD's format is appropriate. Otherwise, the single-line version might be preferred for brevity.

But since the user asked to resolve based on intent and semantics, and both achieve the same thing, I can safely pick either. However, to resolve the conflict without knowing the project's style guide, maybe the single-line is cleaner. Wait, looking at the surrounding context, the method's opening brace is on the same line, and other lines might be using a certain line length. If the line isn't too long, maybe the single-line is better. Alternatively, perhaps the HEAD version was a style adjustment. 

But since the user said to preserve context if unsure, but here the conflict is purely formatting. So the correct resolution is to pick one, but since both are correct semantically, the merge can take either. However, the user wants the conflict resolved if intent is clear. Since both versions do the same thing, I can choose either. To resolve, perhaps the single-line is better as it's more concise. Alternatively, the HEAD version might have been a style preference. Without more context, it's safe to assume that the difference is only formatting, so either is acceptable. Therefore, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping one of them. Let me check the original code again. The line in HEAD has the parameters on separate lines, while the other is on one line. Maybe the project's style allows both, but since the conflict is about formatting, the correct resolution is to pick the one that's consistent with the rest of the file. But since I don't have the rest of the file, perhaps the best way is to choose the more compact version (the one from 5adedd2) to avoid unnecessary line breaks. Alternatively, maybe the HEAD version was adjusting the line length for readability. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line was split in HEAD to adhere to a maximum line length policy. If the line in the HEAD is longer, maybe that's why it was split. But looking at the actual code: 

HEAD version:
data.put(AjaxResponse.GAME_PERMALINK,
          String.format(gamePermalinkFormatProvider.get(), currentUniqueId));

The other version:
data.put(AjaxResponse.GAME_PERMALINK, String.format(gamePermalinkFormatProvider.get(), currentUniqueId));

Assuming that the line length in the second version is within the project's limits, perhaps that's why it's on one line. However, without knowing the project's style, it's hard to say. Since the user says to resolve based on intent and semantics, and both versions are semantically identical, the conflict can be resolved by choosing either. Therefore, the correct resolution is to remove the conflict markers and pick one of the versions. Since the user might prefer the more concise version, I'll go with the one from 5adedd2, which is a single line. So the resolved code would be the line without the line break.</think>

    if (showGameLinkProvider.get() && null != currentUniqueId) {
      data.put(AjaxResponse.GAME_PERMALINK, String.format(gamePermalinkFormatProvider.get(), currentUniqueId));
    }
  }
