Okay, let's see. The user provided a Java code snippet with a merge conflict. The conflict is between two versions of the method `isEqualTo` in the `LongAssert` class. The task is to resolve this conflict by understanding the intent of both changes and merging them correctly without altering the surrounding context.

Looking at the conflict, both sides are modifying the same method. The HEAD version has the method written as `public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected){`, while the other branch has `public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected) {`. The difference is the space between the parameter list and the opening curly brace. The HEAD version doesn't have a space, and the other branch adds a space there.

The goal here is to determine which style is correct or if it's a matter of code formatting. In Java, it's common to have a space before the opening curly brace of a method. However, sometimes projects have their own style guides. Since both changes are about the same method, it's likely a formatting difference. The semantic intent of both branches is the same: to implement the `isEqualTo` method. 

Since the conflict is purely about whitespace, and assuming that the project's code style prefers having a space before the curly brace (which is more standard), the correct resolution would be to take the version from the other branch that includes the space. Therefore, the merged line should be `public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected) {`.

I also need to make sure that the rest of the context remains unchanged. The surrounding code, like the constructor and the other method parts, should stay as they are. There's an extra empty line after the HEAD version's method, but the other branch doesn't have that. The user mentioned preserving spacing as is, but in the conflict resolution, we should remove the extra blank line if it's part of the conflict. Looking at the provided code, after the HEAD's method, there's an extra line before the conflict markers end. The other branch doesn't have that. So resolving the conflict would involve taking the method with the space and ensuring the spacing after the method is correct. However, in the given code, after resolving, the method from the other branch is followed by a line without the extra space. Therefore, the merged code should not include the extra blank line, which was part of the HEAD's version. So the final resolved code would have the method with the space and no extra blank line after it.

Therefore, the correct merged code should use the version from the other branch, including the space before the curly brace and without the extra blank line.</think>
```java

  protected LongAssert(Long actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, LongAssert.class, description);
  }

  public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected) {
    longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```
