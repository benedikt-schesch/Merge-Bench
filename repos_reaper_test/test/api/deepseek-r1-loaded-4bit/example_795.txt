Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict. Let me look at the code snippet carefully.

The conflict is around the declaration of the variable `rpc` of type `HBaseRpc`. In the HEAD version, there's a line that retrieves `rpc` from `rpcs_inflight.get(rpcid)`. The other side (d543609) has removed that line entirely.

Looking at the surrounding code, after the conflict markers, the code checks if a certain flag is set, then uses `rpc` in `deserializeException(buf, rpc)`. If the other side removed the line where `rpc` is declared and assigned, then using `rpc` in `deserializeException` would cause a compilation error because `rpc` wouldn't be declared.

Wait, maybe the other side moved the declaration somewhere else? Let me check the context. Before the conflict markers, there's a try-catch block. Then the conflict happens. The line in HEAD declares `rpc` by getting it from `rpcs_inflight`, while the other branch deletes that line.

If the other branch removed that line, but `rpc` is still used in the code below, that would be a problem. Unless the other branch provides `rpc` in another way. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe the other branch's code doesn't need `rpc` anymore, but that seems unlikely because it's used in `deserializeException`.

So, if the other side removed the declaration, but the usage remains, that's a problem. Therefore, the correct resolution would be to keep the line that declares `rpc` from the HEAD version. Otherwise, the code would reference an undeclared variable. The other branch's deletion might be incorrect or perhaps part of a larger change that's not visible here. Since the user hasn't provided more context, the safest approach is to retain the declaration to avoid a compile error. Therefore, the resolved code should include the line `final HBaseRpc rpc = rpcs_inflight.get(rpcid);` from HEAD.</think>
```java
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        LOG.error("WTF?  RPC #" + rpcid + ": ", e);
      }
    }

    final HBaseRpc rpc = rpcs_inflight.get(rpcid);
    if ((flags & HBaseRpc.RPC_ERROR) != 0) {
      return deserializeException(buf, rpc);
    }
    try {
