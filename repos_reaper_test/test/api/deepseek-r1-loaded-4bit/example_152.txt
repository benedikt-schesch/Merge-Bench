Okay, let's see. The user has a merge conflict in their Java code. The conflict is between two versions of creating a GruntParser object. In the HEAD version, they're using a constructor that takes a StringReader. In the other branch, they're using a constructor that takes both a StringReader and a myPig variable. 

First, I need to understand the intent of both changes. The HEAD version might be an older version where the GruntParser only required the script. The other branch probably introduced a new dependency, maybe passing a Pig instance (myPig) to the parser for additional configuration or context.

I should check if both parameters are necessary. If the new constructor in the other branch is correct and myPig is a necessary component, then including it would resolve the conflict properly. However, if the HEAD version removed the myPig parameter for some reason, that might cause issues. But since the conflict is between adding a parameter and not having it, it's more likely that the correct resolution is to include both parameters as in the second version.

The surrounding code doesn't show where myPig is declared, but assuming it's a valid variable in the context, the correct line should be the one from the branch, which includes both StringReader and myPig. So, the resolved code would use the constructor with both arguments. 

I need to make sure that the rest of the context remains unchanged and that the spacing is preserved. The user emphasized not modifying the context except resolving the conflict. So, the correct merge would be to take the second version of the GruntParser instantiation.</think>
```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "dump b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
