Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The code in question is the getVersion() method. The conflict is between the HEAD version using "1.4" as the fallback and the other branch using "1.2". 

First, I need to understand why each branch changed the version. Maybe one branch was updating to a new release, while the other had a different version. Without additional context, it's hard to know which is correct. 

Since the user asked to resolve based on intent and semantics, I should consider if there's a way to reconcile both. But since the versions are conflicting, it's a direct conflict. If I can't determine which version is appropriate, the safest approach is to leave the conflict unresolved. However, maybe there's a way to infer from surrounding code or standard practices.

Wait, looking at the surrounding code, the catch block in HEAD has a closing brace on the same line, while the other branch has it on the next line. But the user specified to preserve spacing, so that's just a formatting difference and doesn't affect functionality. The main issue is the version string.

Since the merge conflict is about the version number, and there's no way to determine which one is correct without more context, the conflict remains. Therefore, the correct resolution is to leave the conflict markers as is because the intent is ambiguous.</think>
