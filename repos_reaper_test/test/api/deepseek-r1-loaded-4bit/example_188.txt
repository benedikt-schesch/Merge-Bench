Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict between the HEAD version and the other branch. The conflict is in the space between the read method and the skip method. In HEAD, there's a line with just a space and a line with a tab, and in the other branch, there's an empty line. 

Hmm, the main difference here is the whitespace. The HEAD version adds an empty line with a tab, while the other branch has a single line with just a space or maybe an empty line. Wait, looking at the conflict markers:

HEAD has:
    
(which is a line with a tab or spaces)
and the other side has:
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    @Override

So between the methods read and skip, there's a conflict about the spacing. The intent of both sides is probably to have some separation between the two methods. Maybe one added a blank line with a space or tab, and the other removed it. But in Java, whitespace between methods doesn't affect functionality. 

The correct resolution would be to remove the conflict markers and keep the code as it is, possibly maintaining a single blank line between the methods. Since the HEAD has a line with a space or tab, and the other branch has an empty line, maybe the best approach is to just have a single empty line without any extra spaces. But looking at the exact code, the HEAD has a line with a tab (represented by "<<<<<<< HEAD" followed by a line with a tab and then "=======", and the other side has a line with just ">>>>>>> ..." followed by the @Override. 

Wait, the original code in HEAD has:

    public int read(...) { ... }
<<<<<<< HEAD
    
=======

>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    @Override
    public long skip(...) { ... }

So the conflict is between a line with a tab (or spaces) in HEAD and an empty line in the other branch. The actual content between the methods is just whitespace. Since both are trying to separate the methods, but differ in the exact whitespace, the solution is to pick one. However, since the conflict is about a blank line with or without whitespace, in Java, that's inconsequential. So resolving by keeping a single empty line would be appropriate. But how was the original code?

Looking at the code after resolving, the HEAD had a line with a tab (or spaces) after the read method, and the other branch had an empty line. So the merged version should probably just have a single empty line. So in the resolved code, between the read method and the @Override for skip, there's an empty line. So the merged code would be:

    public int read(...) { ... }

    @Override
    public long skip(...) { ... }

Thus, the conflict markers are removed, and the empty line is kept. The original code from both sides had some whitespace, but the important part is that there's a separation. So the correct resolution is to remove the conflict and have a single empty line between the two methods.</think>

    public int read(byte b[], int off, int len) throws IOException {
        int read = in.read(b, off, len);
        pos += read;
        return read;
    }

    @Override
    public long skip(long n) throws IOException {
        long rc = in.skip(n);
        pos += rc;
        return rc;
