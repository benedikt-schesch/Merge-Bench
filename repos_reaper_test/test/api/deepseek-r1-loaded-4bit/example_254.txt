Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The code snippet is in Java, and the conflict is between the HEAD version and another commit. The conflicting part is around the visitPackage method and the visitPOForEach method.

In the HEAD version, there's an empty line after the closing brace of visitPackage. In the other branch, there's a line with some whitespace (four spaces) followed by a line with the closing tag. The actual code for visitPOForEach is the same in both branches.

The conflict markers are around the whitespace differences. Since both versions are essentially the same except for whitespace, maybe it's just a formatting issue. The intent of both sides seems to be to have some spacing between the methods. The HEAD has a blank line, and the other branch has a line with spaces. But in Java, trailing whitespace isn't significant, so maybe the resolution is to take one of them or combine them. However, since the user said to preserve spacing as is unless we can resolve semantically.

Wait, but the user instructions say to think in terms of intent and semantics. If both sides are just adding whitespace, maybe they don't conflict semantically. The HEAD adds a blank line, the other adds a line with spaces. But in terms of code functionality, both are the same. So perhaps the correct resolution is to keep the blank line from HEAD, or maybe the other side's line. But since the conflict is between a blank line and a line with spaces, perhaps it's a matter of code style. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the user says if unsure, leave the conflict. But maybe the intent is the same: separate the methods with some spacing. So merging them by taking one of the whitespace lines. Since the difference is just whitespace, perhaps the conflict can be resolved by choosing either. But since the user wants to preserve spacing as is, maybe the correct approach is to remove the conflict markers and keep the lines. Wait, the original code has:

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
    
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5...

So HEAD has a blank line, the other branch has a line with four spaces. When merged, which one to pick? If the project's code style uses blank lines between methods, then the HEAD version is correct. If they use some indentation, maybe the other. But without knowing, maybe it's safer to keep the blank line, as trailing spaces are often considered unnecessary. Alternatively, maybe the other branch's line is a mistake with extra spaces. But since the user said to preserve spacing, perhaps the resolution is to take the HEAD's blank line. Alternatively, maybe both changes are trying to add a line between the methods, so the conflict is trivial and can be resolved by taking either. Since the code after the conflict is the same, maybe just remove the conflict markers and keep the blank line. But I'm not sure. The user said if not sure, return the same snippet with the conflict. But maybe the intent is the same, so resolve by picking one. Let me check again. The code between the methods: in HEAD, it's a blank line. In the other branch, it's a line with four spaces. So the conflict is about that line. Since both are just whitespace, maybe it's safe to resolve by keeping the blank line. So the merged code would have the blank line from HEAD. So the resolved code would remove the conflict markers and keep the blank line. Then the visitPOForEach method follows. That seems reasonable. So the final code would have the visitPackage method, a blank line, then the visitPOForEach method. The other branch's line with spaces is discarded. That's the resolution.</think>

    public void visitPackage(POPackage pkg) throws VisitorException{
        //do nothing
    }

    public void visitPOForEach(POForEach nfe) throws VisitorException {
        List<PhysicalPlan> inpPlans = nfe.getInputPlans();
        for (PhysicalPlan plan : inpPlans) {
            pushWalker(mCurrentWalker.spawnChildWalker(plan));
            visit();
