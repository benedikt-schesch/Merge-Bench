Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java method. Let's look at the two versions.

In the HEAD version, the return statement is using `idSelector.isObjectId(def)`. The other branch uses `isObjectId(def)`. 

Hmm, the method `isObjectId` isn't called on an object here in the second case. Maybe in one branch, `isObjectId` is a method of the current class, while in the other branch it's called on `idSelector`. 

Wait, the surrounding code has `idSelector.isId(def)` earlier. So the HEAD uses `idSelector` for both `isId` and `isObjectId`. The other branch uses `idSelector.isId` but then a direct `isObjectId`, which might imply that `isObjectId` is a helper method in the same class.

But without more context, it's hard to tell. If the class has a method `isObjectId` that does the same as `idSelector.isObjectId`, then maybe they're equivalent. Or perhaps one branch refactored to move the method.

Alternatively, maybe the two changes are semantically the same but just call the method differently. If both `idSelector.isObjectId(def)` and `isObjectId(def)` are valid and equivalent, then we need to pick the correct one based on the code structure.

Wait, looking at the line before: `idSelector.isId(def)`. So in HEAD, both checks are on `idSelector`. In the other branch, the second check is a method call without `idSelector`. If `isObjectId` is a method in the current class that perhaps delegates to `idSelector`, then both could be correct. But if the other branch removed the `idSelector` because it's redundant or a refactor, that's a conflict.

Since the user said to think about the intent, both sides are checking if the property is an object ID and if its value is null. The difference is how they check if it's an object ID. If the two methods `idSelector.isObjectId(def)` and `isObjectId(def)` are equivalent, then merging them would require choosing the correct one. But if they are different, then it's a conflict.

But without knowing the class's methods, it's ambiguous. The user might have refactored to move the method from `idSelector` to the current class, or vice versa. Since the conflict can't be resolved without knowing which is correct, but maybe the correct resolution is to use the current class's method if that's the intended change.

Alternatively, maybe the `isObjectId` method in the current class calls `idSelector.isObjectId(def)`, making them the same. But if that's the case, then both are correct. However, since the two branches changed the same line differently, and the intent isn't clear, the resolver might have to leave it as a conflict. But the user wants us to resolve if possible.

Wait, perhaps in the branch that uses `isObjectId(def)`, there's a method in the class that does `return idSelector.isObjectId(def);`, so it's a refactor. If that's the case, then the two changes are compatible, and we can use the method without `idSelector` because it's a wrapper. But without knowing that, it's risky.

Alternatively, maybe `isObjectId` is a static import or a helper method. If the merge intended to replace `idSelector.isObjectId` with a direct method call, then the correct line is `isObjectId(def)`. But if the HEAD version is correct, then it's the other way.

Since the user instructed to resolve if we can determine the intent, otherwise leave the conflict. But since I don't have enough context about the existence of `isObjectId` method in the class, it's ambiguous. Therefore, the conflict remains. But wait, maybe in the surrounding context, the method `isObjectId` exists. For example, the HEAD version uses `idSelector.isObjectId`, while the other branch might have a method in the class that does the same thing. If both are correct, then the merge should take one. However, since I can't verify that, perhaps the correct approach is to combine both intents. Wait, no. The lines are conflicting; we have to choose one or the other.

Alternatively, maybe the correct code is to call `isObjectId(def)` if that's a method that was added in one of the branches. But without knowing, it's safer to leave the conflict. But the user wants us to resolve if possible. Hmm.

Wait, the original code before the conflict had `idSelector.isObjectId(def)` in HEAD and `isObjectId(def)` in the other branch. If the other branch's change was to refactor and move the method into the current class, then the correct resolution is to use `isObjectId(def)`. But if the HEAD is correct in using the idSelector's method, then that's the right one.

Since the conflict is between two different method calls, and without knowing which is correct, the best answer is to present the conflict as unresolved. However, the user said to resolve if we can determine the intent based on semantics. Let's check the surrounding code. The line before is `idSelector.isId(def)`, which is the same in both branches. If the other branch changed `idSelector.isObjectId` to `isObjectId`, perhaps that's part of a larger refactor where `isObjectId` is now a local method. But since the code in the other branch is using `isObjectId(def)`, which may be a method in the current class, perhaps that's the intended change. Alternatively, maybe the other branch had a typo or forgot the `idSelector.`.

Alternatively, perhaps `isObjectId` is a static import. But without more info, it's hard to tell. Since the user says to resolve if possible, maybe we can assume that both changes are intended to check if the def is an object ID, and the correct way is to use the current class's method (the other branch). Or perhaps the other branch is correct. But I'm not sure. Therefore, the safe answer is to leave the conflict markers, but the user wants a resolution if possible.

Wait, the original method is called `mustGenerateObjectId`, which suggests that if the object ID needs to be generated. The condition is that the property is an ID and is an object ID and its value is null. So both versions are trying to check if the def is an object ID and the value is null. The difference is in how they check if it's an object ID: via idSelector or via a local method.

If the two branches are changing the way to check for object ID, perhaps the correct resolution is to use the local method `isObjectId(def)` as in the other branch. Maybe the other branch refactored the code to move the responsibility of checking object ID into the current class. So the merged code should use `isObjectId(def)`. Therefore, the correct line is:

return isObjectId(def) && accessor.getValue(pojo) == null;

Thus, resolving the conflict by picking the other branch's version.</think>
```java
    public boolean mustGenerateObjectId(Object pojo) {
        for (BeanPropertyDefinition def : beanDescription(pojo.getClass()).findProperties()) {
            if (idSelector.isId(def)) {
                AnnotatedMember accessor = def.getAccessor();
                accessor.fixAccess(true);
                return isObjectId(def) && accessor.getValue(pojo) == null;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
