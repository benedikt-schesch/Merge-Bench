Okay, let's see. The user provided a Java code snippet with merge conflicts and wants me to resolve them based on the semantics and intent of both sides. The task is to return the resolved code without modifying the surrounding context.

Looking at the conflict in the buildPostRequest method. The HEAD version returns new MockLowLevelHttpRequest() without the url parameter, while the other branch (f125361) includes the url. The buildPutRequest also has a conflict, but the HEAD side just has an empty line and the other side isn't shown here. Wait, the second conflict is only showing the HEAD part, maybe the user didn't include the full code for that part. But the user's instruction is to work with the provided snippet.

Focusing on the first conflict: buildPostRequest. Both versions are creating a MockLowLevelHttpRequest, but one passes the url and the other doesn't. What's the intent here? Maybe the HEAD version forgot to pass the url, while the other branch correctly includes it. Alternatively, perhaps the constructor in HEAD doesn't require the url, but the other branch's version does. Without more context, I have to assume that both changes are valid. But looking at the surrounding code: the buildGetRequest above uses the url parameter. In the HEAD, the buildPostRequest doesn't use it, but the other branch does. So the correct approach might be to use the url in both methods for consistency. Therefore, the resolved line should include the url parameter. So the correct line is return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);. That would merge both changes by taking the version from the f125361 branch.

For the second conflict in buildPutRequest, the HEAD has an empty line and the other side isn't shown. But in the provided snippet, only the HEAD part is present. Wait, the code shows:

  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPutRequest(String url) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD

======= ... but the user's snippet cuts off here. Wait, in the original input, the code snippet provided is:

    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPostRequest(String url) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest();
=======
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
>>>>>>> f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPutRequest(String url) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

So the buildPutRequest has a conflict where HEAD has an empty line after the method declaration, and presumably the other branch has some code. But the user hasn't provided the full conflict markers for that part. Since the user's instruction is to return the entire snippet as provided but resolve conflicts if possible, but here the buildPutRequest conflict is incomplete. Therefore, since the conflict markers for buildPutRequest are not closed (only <<<<<<< HEAD is present), and the user's input doesn't show the other side, we can't resolve that conflict. So we have to leave it as is, because the intent is ambiguous. Therefore, the buildPutRequest conflict remains unresolved.

So the final answer would resolve the buildPostRequest conflict by taking the version with the url, and leave the buildPutRequest conflict as is because there's not enough information.</think>
```java
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPostRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPutRequest(String url) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
