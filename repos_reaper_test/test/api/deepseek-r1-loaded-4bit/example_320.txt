Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The code snippet shows a conflict between the HEAD and another branch (cbb20c8). The conflict is around adding some debug timing code after a block but before the return statement.

Looking at the HEAD side, there's nothing after the closing braces of the try-catch block. The other branch adds a conditional block that calls DebugTimer.betweenEnd("AS STRING") if TwitterApplication.DEBUG is true.

The goal here is to merge both changes without breaking anything. The main code from HEAD is just returning the string, and the other branch is adding debug logging. Since these are in different branches, the debug code should be added right before the return statement. The conflict markers are around where to place this new code.

So, the correct resolution would be to include the debug code from the other branch into the HEAD version. Since there's no overlap in logic—just adding new lines—the debug statements should be placed after the closing braces and before the return. That way, both the existing code and the new debug code are included.

I need to make sure the indentation matches the surrounding code. The added lines in the other branch use four spaces, which seems consistent with the existing code's indentation. So, placing that block right before 'return str;' should work.

No ambiguity here because the two changes are additive and don't modify the same lines. So the merged code should include the debug check after the try-catch block and before returning the string.</think>
```java

                    throw new ResponseException(e.getMessage(), e);
                }
            }
        }
        if(TwitterApplication.DEBUG){
        	DebugTimer.betweenEnd("AS STRING");
        }
        return str;
    }

    public JSONObject asJSONObject() throws ResponseException {
        try {
