Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The code snippet is from a Java enum that lists various constants with their codes and messages. The conflict is between the HEAD version and the branch 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a.

Looking at the HEAD side, there's an entry for CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND with a message about a custom deck. On the other side, there are two entries: CARDCAST_CANNOT_FIND and CARDCAST_INVALID_ID, both related to Cardcast decks.

The first thing to notice is that these entries are probably related but for different features. The HEAD's CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND might be for a custom deck system, while the other branch's entries are for Cardcast decks. Since they have different messages and error codes, they might not be conflicting but rather additions from different features.

But wait, the conflict markers are between CAPSLOCK and DO_NOT_HAVE_CARD. In the HEAD version, after CAPSLOCK comes CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND, while in the other branch, after CAPSLOCK comes CARDCAST_CANNOT_FIND and CARDCAST_INVALID_ID. So the conflict is that both sides added different entries in the same place. 

The question is: are these entries meant to coexist or are they alternatives? If the project uses both custom decks and Cardcast decks, then both sets of entries are valid and should be kept. However, maybe the CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND was a replacement for the Cardcast entries, but that's unlikely since the messages are different.

Another angle: perhaps the two branches added different error codes for different purposes. The HEAD added an error for custom decks not found, and the other branch added errors specific to Cardcast. So they should both be included. The conflict arises because they were added in the same spot in the enum.

So the resolution would be to include both CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND from HEAD and the two Cardcast entries from the other branch. The order might matter, but since enums are ordered, we need to check if there's a specific order required. Looking at the surrounding entries, they seem to be in alphabetical order. Let's check:

BAD_REQUEST, BANNED, CANNOT_JOIN_ANOTHER_GAME, CAPSLOCK, then the conflicting entries. After that, DO_NOT_HAVE_CARD, etc.

CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND starts with 'C', as do CARDCAST entries. So alphabetically, CARDCAST would come before CUSTOM_SET. But in the HEAD, CUSTOM is after CAPSLOCK, while in the other branch, CARDCAST comes after CAPSLOCK. So perhaps the correct order is to have CARDCAST entries first, then CUSTOM_SET, since 'Cardcast' comes before 'Custom' alphabetically. Alternatively, maybe the order isn't strictly alphabetical, but based on when they were added.

But the user hasn't specified anything about the order. Since the two branches added different entries, the correct resolution is to include both. Therefore, the merged code should have all three entries: CARDCAST_CANNOT_FIND, CARDCAST_INVALID_ID, and CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND. The order would depend on which comes first. The original HEAD has CUSTOM_SET after CAPSLOCK, and the other branch has CARDCAST entries there. So merging them in the order they were added in each branch would mean placing the CARDCAST entries first, then the CUSTOM_SET. Because in the HEAD, the CUSTOM_SET is added, and in the other branch, the CARDCAST entries are added. So in the merged code, both should be present, ordered as CARDCAST first, then CUSTOM_SET. Wait, but the HEAD has CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND where the other branch has the two CARDCAST entries. So the conflict is that in HEAD, after CAPSLOCK comes CUSTOM_SET, and in the other branch, after CAPSLOCK comes CARDCAST_CANNOT_FIND and CARDCAST_INVALID_ID. So to merge them, we need to place all three entries in the correct order. Alphabetically, CARDCAST would come before CUSTOM_SET. So the correct merged code would be:

CAPSLOCK("CL", "Try turning caps lock off."),
CARDCAST_CANNOT_FIND("ccf", ...),
CARDCAST_INVALID_ID("cii", ...),
CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND("cscf", ...),
DO_NOT_HAVE_CARD(...),

That way, both sets of entries are included in alphabetical order. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by including both the CARDCAST entries from the other branch and the CUSTOM_SET entry from HEAD, ordered appropriately.</think>
