Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The two branches are adding different imports. The HEAD branch is importing BatchJobUpdateStrategy, while the other branch is importing CountSlaPolicy. Both are from the same package org.apache.aurora.gen. Since these are separate classes, the correct resolution is to include both imports. The conflict markers can be removed, and both import statements should be kept. There's no overlap in their intent here; they're just adding different classes. So the resolved code should have both imports listed.</think>
