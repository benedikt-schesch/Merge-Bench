<think>
Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the two versions.

The conflict is between the HEAD version and the other branch. The line in question is the assertThat statement. The HEAD version has "instanceOf(Girocode.class))" without a space after the comma. The other branch adds a space there, making it "instanceOf(Girocode.class));".

Hmm, in Java, spacing around commas in method arguments is a style choice. Both versions are syntactically correct. The main difference is code formatting. Since the rest of the code might follow a style with spaces after commas, the second version (with the space) is probably the intended one. But I need to make sure that there's no other intent beyond formatting.

Looking at the surrounding code, the other lines have spaces after commas, like in assertEquals("DAAABCDGGD", girocode.getBic()); So consistency would suggest adding the space. Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the version from the branch that adds the space. There's no functional difference here, just formatting. So I'll keep the version with the space.</think>
```java
				"for a good prupose\n" + //
				"Watch this Girocode :-)"

		);
		assertNotNull(scheme);
		assertThat(scheme, instanceOf(Girocode.class));
		Girocode girocode = (Girocode) scheme;
		assertEquals(Encoding.UTF_8, girocode.getEncoding());
		assertEquals("DAAABCDGGD", girocode.getBic());
		assertEquals("Miss Marple", girocode.getName());
		assertEquals("DE91300776014444814989", girocode.getIban());
```
