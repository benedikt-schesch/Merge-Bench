Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The conflict is in the imports section of a Java file. The HEAD version adds an import for java.util.Properties, while the other branch (1488b22) adds an import for java.util.Map. 

First, I need to understand why these imports are being added. Both classes are part of java.util, so they're commonly used. Properties is a subclass of Hashtable, which is a type of Map. But in the code, if both are needed, then we should include both imports. However, maybe the two changes are adding different imports that are both necessary.

Looking at the surrounding context, the existing imports include java.util.HashMap and java.util.Iterator. The conflict is between adding Properties or Map. The user might have added one in one branch and the other in another branch. 

Since both imports are from java.util and are different classes, the correct resolution would be to include both. The conflict markers show that one branch added Properties and the other added Map. So, the resolved code should have both imports. 

Therefore, I should remove the conflict markers and keep both import statements. The order might not matter, but typically they're sorted, so maybe arrange them alphabetically. But the original order in the conflict has Properties first in HEAD and Map second in the other branch. Since both are new additions, combining them by listing both would be correct.</think>
