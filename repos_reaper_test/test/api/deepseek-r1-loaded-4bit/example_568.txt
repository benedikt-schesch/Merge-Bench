Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let's look at the two versions.

In the HEAD version, they're using Json.parse(response).asObject() to create the JsonObject. Then they get "data" as an object with asObject(). 

In the other branch (a17acec), they're creating a JsonObject directly from the response string. Then they use getJsonObject("data") to retrieve the data object. 

Hmm, the main difference seems to be the way they parse the JSON. The HEAD uses a Json.parse method which might return a JsonValue that needs to be cast to an object. The other branch's code constructs a JsonObject directly from the response string. 

Wait, maybe these are two different JSON libraries or different APIs within the same library. For example, maybe one uses a parser that returns a JsonValue, which you then cast to an object, while the other uses a constructor that takes a string. 

But the end goal is the same: parse the response into a JsonObject and extract the "data" field as another JsonObject. Then map it to DebugTokenInfo. 

So the conflict is in how the JSON is parsed and accessed. To resolve this, I need to figure if one approach is correct or if they can be combined. 

If the two approaches are compatible, maybe the correct code uses one method or the other. But if they're from different libraries, perhaps there's a mistake. 

Wait, perhaps the code was changed in one branch to use a different JSON parsing method. For example, maybe the HEAD uses a static parse method, while the other branch uses a constructor. 

Assuming that both approaches are valid but different, I need to see which one is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to combine them, but that's unlikely. 

If I can't determine which approach is correct, I should leave the conflict as is. But the user wants a resolution based on intent and semantics. 

Looking at the surrounding code: after getting the data object, both versions convert it to a string and pass to getJsonMapper().toJavaObject. So data.toString() is used in both cases. 

In the HEAD, data is a JsonObject from the parsed response. In the other branch, data is a JsonObject obtained via getJsonObject. 

If both JsonObject implementations' toString() produce the same JSON string, then either approach would work. But the way to parse the initial response differs. 

Perhaps the correct approach depends on which JSON library is being used. For example, if the project switched from one library to another, the parsing code would change. 

But without knowing which library is correct, it's hard. However, looking at the method names: Json.parse(response).asObject() vs new JsonObject(response). Maybe the first is from a different library (like minimal-json) where parse returns a JsonValue, and you have to check if it's an object. The second might be from another library where JsonObject can be constructed directly from a string. 

If the code in HEAD is correct, then the right approach is to use Json.parse. If the other branch is correct, use new JsonObject. 

But since both are trying to parse the response into a JsonObject, maybe one is outdated and the other is the new way. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code was refactored to use a different JSON library, leading to different parsing methods. 

If the intent is to parse the JSON response into an object, then the correct resolution is to pick the correct parsing method. If both are valid but conflicting changes, the user needs to decide. But the task is to resolve it semantically. 

Wait, maybe there's a way to combine them. For example, if the JsonObject constructor in the a17acec branch is correct, but the way to get the data is via asObject() as in HEAD. But that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct code after merging should use the new JsonObject(response) from the a17acec branch, and then get the data with getJsonObject("data"). 

But why did the HEAD change it to use Json.parse and asObject()? Maybe that's a bug fix. 

Alternatively, maybe the code in HEAD is using a more secure or correct parsing method, whereas the other branch is using a direct approach that might throw exceptions if the response isn't an object. 

If I can't determine which is correct, perhaps the safest way is to choose one, but the user might prefer one over the other. 

Alternatively, maybe both changes are compatible. For example, if the code was updated in both branches to parse JSON differently, but the rest remains the same. 

But given that the two approaches are conflicting, I need to pick the correct one based on the project's current JSON handling. 

Since the user is asking to resolve the conflict by considering the intent and semantics, I need to see if both changes achieve the same goal. 

Both are trying to parse the response into a JsonObject and extract the "data" field. The difference is in the parsing method. 

Assuming that both approaches are valid but come from different branches modifying the same code, the correct resolution would be to pick the most recent or correct approach. 

But without additional context, it's hard. However, looking at the parameter passed to makeRequest: it's using Parameter.with("input_token", inputToken). Maybe the project uses a specific JSON library. 

If the project uses minimal-json, then Json.parse is correct. The asObject() method would check that the parsed value is an object. 

In another library, like javax.json or Gson, the approach might differ. 

Alternatively, the a17acec branch's code uses new JsonObject(response), which might be from org.json.JSONObject, which has a constructor that parses a string. 

So the two branches are using different JSON libraries. That's a problem. 

In that case, merging them would require using one library or the other. 

If the project switched libraries in one branch, the correct resolution is to take the code from the branch that updated the library. 

But without knowing which library is in use, I can't be certain. 

In this case, since the user wants a resolution based on intent and semantics, and if both approaches are valid but conflicting, perhaps the conflict remains. But maybe there's a way to reconcile them. 

Wait, the code after parsing the JSON is the same: data.toString() is passed to the JSON mapper. 

If both JsonObject implementations' toString() returns the correct JSON string, then either approach works. 

But the way to parse the response and get the data differs. 

So, perhaps the correct code is to use the a17acec version, which uses new JsonObject(response), and then getJsonObject("data"). 

Alternatively, the HEAD version uses Json.parse, which might be safer if the response isn't a JSON object. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should be using the Json.parse method to parse the response into a JsonValue, then check if it's an object, which is what the HEAD does. The other branch's code might throw an exception if the response isn't a valid JSON object. 

So maybe the HEAD version is more robust. 

But the other branch's code uses json.getJsonObject("data"), which might be part of a different library's API. 

Hmm. Since the user is asking to resolve the conflict, and if the intent is to parse the JSON response and extract the data object, but the method differs between branches, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the Json.parse method if that's the intended library. 

Alternatively, if the project has switched to using a different JSON library in the a17acec branch, then that code is correct. 

But without knowing which library is being used, I can't make an informed decision. Therefore, the safest approach is to present the conflict as unresolved. 

However, the user wants me to resolve it if possible. 

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in one of the branches. For example, in the HEAD, after parsing, they get "data" as an object. In the other branch, they get the data as a JsonObject via getJsonObject. 

If both are correct, but the method names differ, perhaps one is correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code in HEAD uses a different library where asObject() is needed, while the other branch uses a library where getJsonObject() is the method. 

In this case, the two changes are conflicting because they use different libraries. 

Therefore, the conflict can't be resolved without knowing which library to use. Hence, the merge conflict remains. 

But the user wants me to resolve it if possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the code was refactored in one branch to use a different parsing approach, and the correct resolution is to take one of the branches. 

Wait, perhaps the a17acec branch is adding a new feature that requires using a different JSON parsing method, while the HEAD branch has a bug fix. 

Alternatively, maybe both changes are trying to achieve the same thing but with different syntax. 

In this case, since the code after the data extraction is the same, perhaps either approach is acceptable. 

But since the user asked to resolve based on intent and semantics, and if both are valid, perhaps the conflict remains. 

Alternatively, perhaps the two changes are compatible. For example, maybe the code can be written in a way that satisfies both. But I don't see a way. 

Therefore, since the two changes are conflicting and it's unclear which library is being used, the correct answer is to leave the conflict as is. 

But the user wants a resolution if possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct code uses the a17acec version. For example, if the project moved from minimal-json to another library. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code in HEAD is using a more up-to-date approach. 

But without more context, it's impossible to know. 

In this scenario, the safest approach is to choose one version and proceed, but since I'm supposed to resolve based on intent, and both are trying to parse JSON correctly, maybe there's a way to combine them. 

Wait, looking at the code again. The HEAD uses Json.parse(response).asObject(), which parses the response into a JsonObject. Then gets "data" as an object. 

The other branch uses new JsonObject(response), which parses the response into a JsonObject, then gets "data" as a JsonObject. 

If both approaches correctly parse the response into a JsonObject, then either could work. But depending on the library, one might be correct. 

Assuming that the a17acec branch is using a different library where the constructor parses the string, then that's the correct approach. 

Alternatively, if the project uses the library from the HEAD, then that's correct. 

But without knowing, I can't decide. 

In this case, the answer would be to leave the conflict. However, the user may expect an expert to resolve it. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a third way. For example, maybe the Json.parse is part of the library's API, and the other branch's code is incorrect. 

Alternatively, perhaps the a17acec branch is correct because it's using a more efficient method. 

But I don't have enough information. 

Given that, I think the conflict remains unresolved, so the answer should present the original code with the conflict. However, the user's instruction says to return the resolved code if possible. 

Wait, the user says: "If you are not sure on how to resolve the conflict or if the intent is ambiguous, please return the same snippet with the conflict."

So, if I'm not sure, leave the conflict. 

But in this case, I'm not sure because the two approaches use different JSON parsing methods which could be from different libraries. 

Therefore, the correct answer is to leave the conflict markers as is.</think>
