Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code is adding entries to a map called REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES. Both sides are adding the same exception class, CallQueueTooBigException, but the indentation differs. The HEAD version has the line indented with 12 spaces, while the other branch uses 32 spaces (assuming each tab is 4 spaces, but Java usually uses 4 spaces per indent level). 

Looking at the surrounding lines, like the lines for UnknownRowLockException and VersionMismatchException, they're indented with 32 spaces. The line after the conflict, for UnknownProtocolException, is also indented with 32 spaces. So the remote branch's version is consistent with the existing code style. The HEAD version's indentation is less, which breaks the pattern. 

The intent of both branches is to add the same exception, but the conflict is purely about formatting. Since the surrounding code uses 32 spaces, aligning the CallQueueTooBigException line to match that makes sense. Therefore, resolving the conflict by choosing the remote branch's indentation would maintain consistency.</think>
```java
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(UnknownRowLockException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new UnknownRowLockException(null, null));
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(VersionMismatchException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new VersionMismatchException(null, null));
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(CallQueueTooBigException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new CallQueueTooBigException(null, null));
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(UnknownProtocolException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new UnknownProtocolException(null, null));
  }

  /** We don't know the RPC protocol version of the server yet.  */

```

Rationale: Both sides agree on the semantic content - they're adding the same exception type with identical constructor parameters. The conflict is purely about whitespace/indentation alignment. The remote branch's indentation (32 spaces) matches the pattern established by the previous lines for UnknownRowLockException and VersionMismatchException, as well as the following line for UnknownProtocolException. Maintaining consistent indentation improves readability without affecting functionality.
