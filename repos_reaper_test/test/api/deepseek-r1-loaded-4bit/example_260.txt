Okay, let's see. The user provided a Java code snippet with a merge conflict and wants me to resolve it. The conflict is in the constructor of the ReadOnceBag class. The two versions have different parameter types and names.

First, I need to look at both sides of the conflict. The HEAD version uses parameters LitePackager pkgr, Iterator<NullableTuple> tupIter, Object key. The other branch uses Packager pkgr, Iterator<NullableTuple> tupIter, PigNullableWritable keyWritable. 

The goal is to merge these without losing the intent of either change. Let's check the instance variables. Both versions assign this.pkgr = pkgr; and this.tupIter = tupIter;. The difference is in the third parameter: HEAD uses key, and the other branch uses keyWritable. However, the assignment in both cases is this.keyWritable = keyWritable;. Wait, that's interesting. In the HEAD version, the parameter is named 'key' but assigned to 'keyWritable'. That might be a mistake because the variable names don't match. The other branch correctly uses keyWritable as both the parameter name and the assignment. 

So, the conflict arises from different parameter types and names. The HEAD has 'Object key' and assigns to 'keyWritable', which might be incorrect if 'keyWritable' is of type PigNullableWritable. The other branch correctly uses PigNullableWritable for the parameter. 

The question is: what's the correct type for pkgr and keyWritable? The HEAD uses LitePackager, while the other uses Packager. If Packager is a superclass or interface that LitePackager implements, maybe changing the parameter to Packager is acceptable. But if the HEAD introduced a more specific type (LitePackager), then merging to Packager might lose functionality. Alternatively, perhaps the other branch generalized the parameter to Packager. 

Assuming that the intent is to use the more general Packager type (as per the other branch), but also to correct the key parameter from Object to PigNullableWritable, the correct merge would be to take both changes: use Packager as the type for pkgr and PigNullableWritable for the third parameter. 

Wait, but the HEAD's third parameter is 'Object key' and assigns to this.keyWritable. If the other branch changes the parameter to PigNullableWritable keyWritable, then merging those would resolve the name and type. So combining both changes: the first parameter becomes Packager pkgr (from the other branch), and the third parameter becomes PigNullableWritable keyWritable (from the other branch), and the assignment remains this.keyWritable = keyWritable. 

Therefore, the resolved constructor should have Packager as the type for pkgr and PigNullableWritable for the third parameter. The HEAD's LitePackager is more specific, but if the other branch's change is to generalize it, that's the correct merge. 

So the merged code would be:

public ReadOnceBag(Packager pkgr, Iterator<NullableTuple> tupIter, PigNullableWritable keyWritable) {

This combines both changes. The parameter types from the other branch are used, and the variable names match the assignments. The conflict markers are removed, and the code should compile correctly.</think>

    public ReadOnceBag(Packager pkgr, Iterator<NullableTuple> tupIter,
            PigNullableWritable keyWritable) {
        this.pkgr = pkgr;
        this.tupIter = tupIter;
        this.keyWritable = keyWritable;
    }
