Okay, let's see. The user provided a Java code snippet with a merge conflict in the Javadoc comment. The conflict is between the HEAD version and the a17acec commit. The HEAD says the attachment is an image, while the other branch says it includes image, link, album, video.

I need to resolve this conflict by understanding the intent of both changes. The HEAD version is more specific, mentioning only image. The other branch expands it to include more types. It's likely that the latter is a more accurate or updated description, maybe because the attachment can handle more media types now.

The comment's purpose is to inform developers about possible attachment types. If the intention was to broaden the allowed attachments, merging the two by including all mentioned types makes sense. Since the second part lists more types, it's probably the correct resolution. I should combine them, taking the more comprehensive description from the a17acec branch. So the resolved line should list all four types: image, link, album, video.

I also need to make sure not to alter any other parts of the code. The context around the conflict, like the @return line and the preceding comments, should stay the same. Removing the conflict markers and keeping the most complete information from both branches is the way to go here.</think>
```java
  @Setter
  @Facebook("comments")
  private Comments comments;

  /**
   * Attachment (image, link, album, video) added to a comment.
   *
   * To force Facebook to fill the <code>attachment</code> field you have to fetch the comment with the
   * <code>fields=attachment</code> parameter, otherwise the attachments are <code>null</code>.
   *
   * @return Attachment on the comment
``` 

The resolution combines the most complete type description from the incoming change ("image, link, album, video") while preserving the important documentation context about fetching attachments. The semantic intent is to document all possible attachment types while maintaining the usage notes about Facebook's field population behavior.
