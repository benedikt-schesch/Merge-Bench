Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at what's changed between the two versions. The conflict is in the method declaration of addSpectator. The HEAD version has the throws clause split into two lines, with the second line indented. The other branch, from commit 5adedd2, has the same throws clause but on a single line. 

The goal here is to combine these changes without altering the intended functionality. Since both versions declare the same exceptions, the conflict is purely about code formatting. The semantic meaning hasn't changed. 

In Java, how the method signatures are formatted (like line breaks in the throws clause) doesn't affect the functionality. So the correct resolution would be to pick one of the formatting styles. But since the user asked to consider the intent and semantics, and both sides are the same in that regard, I should choose the version that's more readable or follows the project's style guide.

However, the user instructed not to modify the context at all if unsure, but if I can resolve it based on intent, I should. Since both changes are just formatting, maybe the second version is more concise. Alternatively, perhaps the first version is preferred for line length reasons. But without more context on the project's style, it's a bit ambiguous. However, since the user wants a resolution that considers semantics and intent, and both are the same, I can safely choose either. 

Wait, the user said to preserve spacing as is in the context. But the conflict is between two different spacings. Since the surrounding code isn't shown beyond the method signature, maybe the correct approach is to take the version from one of the branches. But since the user wants the entire snippet with the conflict resolved, I need to merge them. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct resolution is to keep the single-line throws clause because it's more compact, or the multi-line if that's the project's style. But without knowing, maybe the best approach is to pick the one that's more standard. In Java, it's common to have the throws clause on the same line if it fits, otherwise split. Here, the line length might be the reason for the split. But in the second version, it's on one line. 

Since the user hasn't provided more context, but the conflict is purely formatting, the best way is to pick one. The answer should merge by taking one of the versions. Since the second version (from commit 5adedd2) has the throws clause on a single line without the line break, which might be the corrected version, perhaps that's the intended resolution. So I'll remove the conflict markers and use the single-line version.</think>
