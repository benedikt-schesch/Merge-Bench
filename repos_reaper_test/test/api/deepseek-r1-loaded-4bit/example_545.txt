Okay, let's see. The user provided a code snippet with a merge conflict and wants me to resolve it by understanding the intent of both sides. The conflict is in the line where jaxRsResources is being assigned. The HEAD version splits the parameter using split with a comma, and the other branch does the same but without the line break.

Hmm, the difference between the two versions is just the formatting of the split method. The HEAD has the split method's argument on a new line, while the other branch has it all in one line. Since the comma is the delimiter in both cases, the actual functionality is the same. The conflict is purely about code style.

In Java, splitting a string with "," or splitting with "," without a line break doesn't change the result. So the semantic meaning is identical. The intent of both branches is to split the parameter by commas into a list. Therefore, resolving this conflict would involve choosing either formatting style. But since the user wants to preserve context and spacing as is, maybe the correct approach is to pick one, but the user instructions say not to modify the context if unsure. Wait, the user said if unsure or if the intent is ambiguous, return the same snippet with the conflict. But here, the intent is clear—both are trying to split the string by comma. The only difference is code formatting.

But wait, the user's instruction says to make sure not to modify the context at all and preserve spacing as is. However, in the conflict, the two versions have different line breaks. The merge conflict is about whether to break the line after split( or not. Since the user wants the spacing preserved, but the conflict is between two different spacings, resolving it would require choosing one. But the user says if not sure, leave the conflict. However, in this case, both changes are functionally the same. So perhaps the correct resolution is to take either one. But which one? The merge tool would typically pick one, but the user wants a semantic resolution.

Alternatively, maybe the split was written in two lines in HEAD and one line in the other branch. Since both are valid, but the line break is just stylistic, the resolution could be to keep the version without the line break for brevity, or keep the HEAD version if that's the original code style. But without more context on the code style, it's hard to say. However, the user wants the conflict resolved only if the intent is clear. Since both achieve the same thing, maybe either is acceptable. But in such cases, the correct resolution is to remove the conflict markers and choose one, as the code is semantically the same.

Therefore, the resolved code would take either version. Since the user's example shows that the assistant should return the resolved code without conflict markers, the correct approach is to pick one. But the assistant's instructions say not to modify the context. Wait, the user says: "make sure you do not modify the context at all and preserve the spacing as is." But the conflict is between two spacings. So if I choose one, I am modifying the context. Wait, no—the conflict is between two versions. The correct way is to decide which spacing to keep. But since both are correct, perhaps the assistant should pick the one that's more concise, like the version from the branch 1d97bfa, which has the split on one line. Because splitting a simple comma doesn't need a line break, perhaps that's the intended resolution. Alternatively, maybe the HEAD version is part of a codebase that uses line breaks for method arguments. Without more context, it's ambiguous. But according to the problem statement, if the intent is clear, resolve it. The intent here is the same. So the conflict is purely stylistic. Therefore, the resolution is to pick either. But since the user wants the assistant to resolve it, perhaps pick the version without the line break as it's more compact. Therefore, the resolved line would be:

jaxRsResources = Arrays.asList(getParameter(args, ++i).split(","));

So the conflict markers are removed, and that line is kept. The rest of the context remains the same. Therefore, the final code snippet would have that line without conflict markers.</think>
```java
            } else if ("--application-name".equals(arg)) {
                applicationName = getParameter(args, ++i);
            } else if ("--endpoint".equals(arg)) {
                endpoint = getParameter(args, ++i);
            } else if ("--jaxrs-resources".equals(arg)) {
                jaxRsResources = Arrays.asList(getParameter(args, ++i).split(","));
            } else {
                defSource = arg;
            }
        }
