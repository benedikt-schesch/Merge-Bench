Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the changes from both branches.

In the HEAD version, they're using 'myKey' and checking if the key is wrapped. The other branch uses 'keyWritable' instead. The conflict is in the variable names and how they cast the tuple.

First, I should check if the variable names are conflicting or if they represent the same intent. Both sides assign curKey to their respective variable (myKey vs keyWritable). But maybe these variables are the same, just renamed. If that's the case, I need to pick the correct variable name that's consistent in the codebase.

Looking at the surrounding context, the code is part of handling keys that might be wrapped. The code in both branches does the same thing except for the variable name. The comment mentions unwrapping the key, which suggests that the variable might have been renamed from myKey to keyWritable in one branch. If both changes are meant to use the correct variable name, I should choose the one that's currently valid.

Also, the line where they cast the tuple: HEAD has (Tuple)myKey.getValueAsPigType(), and the other branch has (Tuple) keyWritable.getValueAsPigType(). Again, same logic but different variable names.

If the variable was renamed in one branch, the correct resolution is to use the new name. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, since both changes are modifying the same lines, it's likely a variable rename. The commit message from the other branch (88ae4a5) might indicate a refactoring where myKey was renamed to keyWritable. If that's the case, the correct variable is keyWritable.

So, the resolved code should use keyWritable in both places. The rest of the code remains the same. The check for isKeyWrapped.get(index) is the same in both branches. The assignment to curKey and the method call to HDataType.getWritableComparableTypes is identical except for the variable name.

Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by choosing the version from the other branch, replacing myKey with keyWritable. This way, the variable name is consistent, and the logic remains correct.</think>
```java
        Packager pkgr = packagers.get(index);

        // check to see if we need to unwrap the key. The keys may be
        // wrapped inside a tuple by LocalRearrange operator when jobs
        // with different map key types are merged
        PigNullableWritable curKey = keyWritable;
        if (!sameMapKeyType && !inCombiner && isKeyWrapped.get(index)) {
            Tuple tup = (Tuple) keyWritable.getValueAsPigType();
            curKey = HDataType.getWritableComparableTypes(tup.get(0),
                    pkgr.getKeyType());
            curKey.setIndex(origIndex);
        }
```
