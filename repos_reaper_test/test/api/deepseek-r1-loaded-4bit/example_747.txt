Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the notifySidebarSlideOpen method. Both versions are animating the translationX with the same params.leftMargin. The difference is in how they format the setDuration method.

In the HEAD version, it's all on one line: setDuration(SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();

In the other branch (c923751...), the setDuration is split into two lines with the parameter on the next line. The code is the same semantically, just formatted differently.

Since both changes are about code formatting and not the actual logic, the intent is the same. The correct resolution would be to pick one of the formatting styles. But since the user asked to preserve context and not modify unless necessary, maybe the conflict is just a formatting difference. However, the user wants a semantic resolution. Since both are the same in intent, either formatting is acceptable. But perhaps the second version with the line break is more readable. Alternatively, maybe the HEAD version is more compact. But since the conflict is about code style, and both achieve the same thing, we can choose either. However, the user says to resolve if possible. So I'll merge them by choosing one. Maybe the second version with the line break is better for readability. So the resolved code would have the line break. But wait, the user said not to modify the context. Wait, the conflict is between two versions of the same line. So the correct resolution is to accept one of them. Since the code is the same except for formatting, but the user wants to preserve spacing as is. Wait, the user's instruction says to return the entire snippet as provided if unsure, but if the intent is clear, resolve it. Since both versions are the same in functionality, just formatting, the conflict can be resolved by taking either. But maybe the line break is from a different style guide. Alternatively, perhaps the correct resolution is to combine them. Wait, no, because the line is split in one version. So the correct resolution is to pick one. Since the conflict is purely stylistic, but the user wants semantic resolution. Since both are the same semantically, the conflict can be resolved by choosing either. But perhaps the correct approach is to keep the line as it is in one of the branches. Since the user didn't specify which style to prefer, maybe the resolver should choose the version with the line break for better readability. Therefore, the resolved code would have the setDuration split into two lines. But wait, the original code in the conflict shows that HEAD has it on one line, and the other branch splits it. So merging them would require picking one. Since the user wants to preserve the surrounding context and not modify it, but resolve the conflict. Therefore, the correct resolution is to take one of the versions. Since both are correct, and there's no functional difference, the conflict can be resolved by choosing either. But maybe the line break is better for line length. So I'll resolve it by keeping the split version. So the final code would be the one from the c923751... branch. Therefore, the conflict markers are removed, and the code from the second part is kept.</think>
