Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in a Java class, specifically in the variable declarations section. The HEAD version has two private variables: mVoteTargetView and mVoteTargetCommentInfo. The other branch, from commit c08e0d7, adds another variable called mVoteTargetSpans. 

The goal here is to resolve the conflict by combining both changes without altering the context. Since both variables are declared as private and are part of the UI state, it's likely that they serve different purposes but are related. The HEAD branch might be missing the mVoteTargetSpans variable that the other branch introduced. 

The user instructed to preserve the context and spacing, so I need to make sure that the order and spacing are maintained as much as possible. The conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) should be removed, and both changes should be integrated.

Looking at the code, the conflict occurs between the declarations of mVoteTargetCommentInfo and the closing of the section. The other branch adds mVoteTargetSpans after mVoteTargetCommentInfo. Since there's no overlap in variable names, it's safe to include both. The correct resolution would be to keep all three variables: mVoteTargetView, mVoteTargetCommentInfo, and mVoteTargetSpans. 

No ambiguity here because the variables don't conflict in purpose; they're just additional state variables. So the resolved code should list all three variables in the order they appear, removing the conflict markers.</think>
```java
    private int mNumVisibleComments;

    // UI State
    private View mVoteTargetView = null;
    private CommentInfo mVoteTargetCommentInfo = null;
    private URLSpan[] mVoteTargetSpans = null;
    
    // ProgressDialogs with percentage bars
    private AutoResetProgressDialog mLoadingCommentsProgress;
