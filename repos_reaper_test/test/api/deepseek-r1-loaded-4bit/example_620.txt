Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The user provided a Java code snippet with a conflict between the HEAD and a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe branches. The conflict is about an import statement. 

In the HEAD version, there's an import for several classes from com.restfb packages, and then the DateUtils. The other branch adds an import for Checkin.Place.Location from com.restfb.types.

My task is to resolve this conflict by understanding the intent of both sides. Both sides are adding necessary imports. The conflict arises because both changes are made to the same part of the import block. Since these are separate import statements, they can coexist without issues. Java allows multiple imports, and as long as they don't conflict in terms of class names, it's safe to include both.

Looking at the code, the HEAD branch doesn't have the Location import, while the other branch does. The correct resolution would be to include both imports. So, the merged code should have both the JsonObject import and the Location import, followed by DateUtils.

I need to make sure that the order of the imports is correct, but since they are from different packages (com.restfb.json vs com.restfb.types), they should be grouped accordingly. However, in the given code, the conflict is between two consecutive lines. The HEAD has JsonObject and then DateUtils, while the other branch adds Location before DateUtils. So, the correct merge would be to add the Location import line from the other branch and keep the JsonObject from HEAD, then proceed with DateUtils.

Therefore, the resolved code should include both imports without any conflict markers. The spacing should be preserved as per the original context. There's no ambiguity here since both imports are necessary and don't interfere with each other. So the merged snippet will have both import statements.</think>
