Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java method getInfo, specifically the line where a new HashMap is created. The HEAD version uses explicit type parameters with new HashMap<GameInfo, Object>(), while the other branch (from commit 5adedd2) uses the diamond operator <>.

Java 7 introduced the diamond operator, allowing the compiler to infer the type arguments from the context. So, using <> is more concise and modern. Both versions should be functionally equivalent because the left side of the assignment declares the generic types, so the right side doesn't need to repeat them. 

The intent of both changes seems to be the same: create a HashMap for GameInfo and Object. The conflict arises from stylistic differencesâ€”explicit vs. inferred type parameters. Since the diamond operator is preferred in newer Java versions for brevity and readability, resolving the conflict by choosing the diamond operator makes sense. There's no semantic difference here, just syntax. So the correct resolution is to use the diamond operator from the incoming branch.</think>

  public Map<GameInfo, Object> getInfo(final boolean includePassword) {
    final Map<GameInfo, Object> info = new HashMap<>();
    info.put(GameInfo.ID, id);
    // This is probably happening because the game ceases to exist in the middle of getting the
    // game list. Just return nothing.
    if (null == host) {
      return null;
