Okay, let's try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. So the conflict is in the imports for Vector3. The HEAD version is using org.spout.math.vector.Vector3, while the other branch is using org.spout.api.math.Vector3. 

Hmm, I need to determine which one is the correct import here. Both sides are importing a class named Vector3, but from different packages. The package names are different: one is org.spout.math.vector and the other is org.spout.api.math. 

I should check the context. The file is part of the org.spout.api.collision package. The other imports include org.spout.api.math.ReactConverter and org.spout.physics.collision.ContactInfo. The fact that there's an import from org.spout.api.math suggests that maybe the correct Vector3 is the one from org.spout.api.math, since that's part of the same API package structure. 

Wait, but why would the HEAD version have a different import? Maybe there was a refactoring where Vector3 was moved from org.spout.api.math to org.spout.math.vector, or vice versa. If the other branch is older, maybe the correct one is the api.math version. Or perhaps the HEAD is a newer change that moved the class.

Looking at the surrounding code, the class SpoutContactInfo uses ContactInfo from org.spout.physics.collision. The ContactInfo might be using a specific Vector3 implementation. If the wrapped ContactInfo expects the org.spout.math.vector.Vector3, then the HEAD version is correct. Alternatively, if the ContactInfo is part of the API and uses the api.math.Vector3, then the other branch is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the ReactConverter is part of the API and uses Vector3 from api.math, so the import should align with that. Let me think: if ReactConverter is in org.spout.api.math, and it uses Vector3, then Vector3 should also be from the same package. So the correct import would be org.spout.api.math.Vector3. That would make sense because both ReactConverter and Vector3 are in the same package. 

Wait, but in the HEAD version, ReactConverter is imported from org.spout.api.math, and Vector3 is from org.spout.math.vector. That might be a problem if ReactConverter requires the api.math.Vector3. So maybe the other branch's import is correct, and the HEAD version is incorrect. Or perhaps there was a move of the Vector3 class from api.math to math.vector as part of a refactor.

Without more context, it's hard to say. But given that the other import is from the api.math package, and the conflicting import is between api.math and math.vector, it's possible that the correct one is the api.math version, especially if the project structure organizes API classes under the api package. 

So the merge conflict resolution would be to choose the org.spout.api.math.Vector3 import from the other branch, and remove the HEAD version. Therefore, the resolved code should have the import from org.spout.api.math.Vector3.</think>
