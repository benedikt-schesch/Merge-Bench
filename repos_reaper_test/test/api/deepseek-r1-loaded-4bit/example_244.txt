Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The code is in Java, and the conflict is between the HEAD version and another commit (1cb2531). The conflicting part is how the List<List<InputSplit>> combinedSplits is assigned.

In the HEAD version, the line is:
List<List<InputSplit>> combinedSplits =
    MapRedUtil.getCombinePigSplits(oneInputSplits, maxCombinedSplitSize, conf);

In the other branch, it's:
List<List<InputSplit>> combinedSplits = 
        MapRedUtil.getCombinePigSplits(oneInputSplits, maxCombinedSplitSize, conf);

So the difference is just the formatting of the line break and indentation. The HEAD version uses a single tab or space after the equals sign, then breaks the line and indents the method call. The other branch adds an extra space after the equals and breaks the line with more indentation (maybe 8 spaces or two tabs?).

Since both versions are essentially doing the same thing—calling MapRedUtil.getCombinePigSplits and assigning it to combinedSplits—the intent is identical. The conflict is purely about code style or formatting preferences. 

The best way to resolve this is to choose one of the formatting styles. But since the user asked to consider semantics and intent, and both sides achieve the same functionality, we can pick either. However, in merge conflicts like this, it's common to take one version, perhaps the more recent one, or the one that aligns with the project's coding standards.

Alternatively, maybe the project uses a specific indentation style. If the surrounding code uses a certain indentation, we should match that. Looking at the surrounding context, the line before the conflict is:
maxCombinedSplitSize = blockSize;

The HEAD version's line after that is indented with 4 spaces (assuming the code uses 4 spaces for indentation), while the other branch uses 8 spaces. But in Java, typically, line continuations are indented by an additional level. So if the codebase uses 4 spaces per indent, then the HEAD version has one level (4 spaces) and the other branch has two levels (8 spaces). However, without knowing the project's specific style guide, it's hard to say which is correct.

But since the user says to preserve the context if unsure, but here the conflict is purely formatting. So maybe the correct approach is to pick one. Alternatively, perhaps the correct merge is to adjust the line to have consistent indentation. However, in merge conflicts, if both changes are just whitespace, it's safe to pick either, but sometimes merge tools would auto-resolve if the only difference is whitespace.

In this case, the user wants a semantic resolution. Since both versions are semantically the same, the conflict can be resolved by choosing either. But maybe the second version (from commit 1cb2531) has a more proper indentation? Or perhaps the project uses an 8-space continuation line. Alternatively, maybe the HEAD version is correct.

Wait, looking at the surrounding code after the conflict, the for loop is indented with 8 spaces (assuming that the code uses 4 spaces per indent level). For example:

for (int i = 0; i < combinedSplits.size(); i++)
    pigSplits.add(...);

If the code uses 4 spaces, then the for loop body is indented by 4 spaces. But in the code, the line after the for loop is indented with 4 spaces. So perhaps the code uses 4 spaces per indent. Then the method call in the HEAD is indented by 4 spaces (after the assignment), while the other branch uses 8 spaces. That might be inconsistent. However, in Java, it's common to have the line continuation indented by 8 spaces (two levels) if the line is split. For example:

SomeObject someVariable = someMethodCall(
        argument1, argument2, argument3);

In this case, the second line is indented by 8 spaces. So maybe the correct indentation is 8 spaces here. So the second version (from the other branch) is correct. Therefore, resolving the conflict by taking the second version's indentation.

But again, this is a style choice. Since the user said to resolve based on intent and semantics, and both are the same, but the conflict is about formatting, the correct resolution is to pick one. Since the answer must return the resolved code, I can choose either, but perhaps the second version is more properly indented. Alternatively, maybe both are acceptable, and the merge can take either. However, the user wants the conflict resolved if possible.

In this case, I think the best way is to accept the version from the other branch (the one with more indentation) as it might align with the project's style. Therefore, the resolved code would have:

List<List<InputSplit>> combinedSplits = 
        MapRedUtil.getCombinePigSplits(...);

So removing the conflict markers and keeping the line from the other branch. The rest of the code remains the same.</think>
```java
        } else {
            long maxCombinedSplitSize = conf.getLong("pig.maxCombinedSplitSize", 0);
            if (maxCombinedSplitSize== 0)
                // default is the block size
                maxCombinedSplitSize = blockSize;
            List<List<InputSplit>> combinedSplits = 
                    MapRedUtil.getCombinePigSplits(oneInputSplits, maxCombinedSplitSize, conf);
            for (int i = 0; i < combinedSplits.size(); i++)
                pigSplits.add(createPigSplit(combinedSplits.get(i), inputIndex, targetOps, i, conf));
            return pigSplits;
        }
    }
