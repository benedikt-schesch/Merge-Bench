<think>
Okay, let me look at this merge conflict. The code is in Java, and the conflict is in the error message part. The HEAD version has the string concatenation split into two lines, while the other branch has it on a single line. 

Hmm, the difference here is just formatting. Both versions are trying to achieve the same thing: construct an error message when an unsupported language is provided. The semantic meaning is identical. The only change is the line break in the string concatenation.

In Java, string concatenation doesn't care about line breaks in the code; it's just a style choice. So resolving this conflict would mean choosing one of the two styles. Since the message is the same, either version is correct. But maybe the second version is more concise, or perhaps the first was split for line length reasons. 

Since the user wants me to resolve based on intent and semantics, and there's no ambiguity here, I can safely pick one. The conflict markers can be removed, and either version kept. But the user's instruction says to return the resolved code if sure. Since both are semantically the same, I can choose either. Let's go with the shorter single-line version from the other branch because it's cleaner. So the resolved code would have the single-line error message.</think>
```java
        if (language != null) {
            if ("swagger".equals(language)) {
                definition = SwaggerUtils
                        .getDefinition(defSource, ulogin, upwd);
            } else {
                failWithErrorMessage("The language " + language + " is not currently supported. ");
            }
        } else {
            if (defSource != null) {
                Class<?> clazz = null;
                try {
