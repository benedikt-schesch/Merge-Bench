Okay, let's see what the problem is here. There's a merge conflict in the Java code. The HEAD version has some lines registering a receiver with an IntentFilter, and then the other branch (760cca9) adds a method called fetchAll() with several fetch calls, followed by closing a method block with a }.

So the conflict is between the HEAD's continued registrations and the other branch's new methods. The key is to figure out the correct order. In Java, method declarations can't be inside another method. Looking at the context, the HEAD part is inside a method, probably the constructor or an init method, where they're setting up receivers. The other branch's code is adding a public method fetchAll() that calls various fetch methods.

The conflict markers are between the registerReceiver calls and the new method. The HEAD doesn't have the closing } for the method, while the other branch does. So the correct resolution would be to keep all the registerReceiver calls from HEAD, then close the method with }, then add the new fetchAll() method from the other branch. That way, the method containing the registrations is properly closed, and the new method is added afterwards. That makes sense because the methods should be separate in the class body. So the merged code should include all registrations, then the closing brace, then the fetchAll method and the rest. Let me check the spacing to make sure it's preserved. The original spacing has 4 spaces before the new method, so that should be maintained. The conflict is resolved by correctly placing the methods in the class structure.</think>
```java
                new IntentFilter(InfoSystem.INFOSYSTEM_RESULTSREPORTED));
        TomahawkApp.getContext().registerReceiver(mCollectionManagerReceiver,
                new IntentFilter(InfoSystem.INFOSYSTEM_OPLOGISEMPTIED));
        TomahawkApp.getContext().registerReceiver(mCollectionManagerReceiver,
                new IntentFilter(DatabaseHelper.PLAYLISTSDATASOURCE_RESULTSREPORTED));
    }

    public void fetchAll() {
        fetchPlaylists();
        fetchLovedItemsPlaylist();
        fetchStarredAlbums();
        fetchStarredArtists();
    }

    public static CollectionManager getInstance() {
        return Holder.instance;
    }
```

The conflict is resolved by:
1. Keeping all three `registerReceiver` calls from HEAD that register intent filters
2. Preserving the method closure `}` from HEAD's context
3. Incorporating the new `fetchAll()` method from the incoming branch
4. Maintaining the static `getInstance()` method that follows

Both changes are semantically compatible - the HEAD changes continue configuring receivers while the incoming branch adds a new public method for fetching collection data. The indentation and method ordering are preserved according to Java class structure conventions.
