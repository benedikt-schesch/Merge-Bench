Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The test method checkContentTypeBytes_fallback has a conflict between the two branches. In HEAD, they're using an assertThat statement with hasContentType, which looks like an assertion from a library like AssertJ. The other branch uses assertEquals with getContentType, which is probably JUnit's built-in assertion.

The intent of both sides seems to be the same: verify that the content type is "application/octet-stream". The difference is in the testing framework used. Since both are valid, but they conflict syntactically, I need to choose one or the other. However, the user wants a semantic resolution. If both assertions achieve the same result, maybe they can be merged. But wait, maybe the HEAD version is using a more fluent style, while the other is using traditional JUnit. Without more context, it's hard to know which one to pick. But the user said to resolve based on intent and semantics. Since both are testing the same thing, perhaps either is acceptable. However, since the conflict is in the same line, I need to pick one. Maybe the HEAD version is preferred if they're moving to AssertJ. Alternatively, the user might want to keep both, but that's not possible here. Since the user might expect a resolution, I'll choose one, but if unsure, leave the conflict. But the user said if unsure, return the conflict. Wait, the user said if the intent is ambiguous, return the conflict. Here, the intent is the same, just different assertions. So maybe it's safe to pick either. But since the code around might use one style, but in the given context, the next test checkContentTypeBytes_manual might have similar assertions. Looking at the surrounding code, the other test isn't shown. But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps it's better to resolve using one. Alternatively, maybe the correct resolution is to use the HEAD version if that's the project's standard. But since I can't know, maybe the conflict remains. Wait, but the user said to resolve if possible. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct assertion is to use the method that correctly tests the content type. Both lines do the same thing. So maybe the conflict can be resolved by choosing either. However, since the user hasn't provided more context, it's ambiguous. Therefore, according to the instructions, if unsure, return the same snippet with the conflict. But wait, the user said to think in terms of intent and semantics. Both lines are trying to assert the content type. So semantically, they are equivalent. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by choosing either. But which one? Maybe the HEAD version is better as it's using a more modern assertion library. Or perhaps the project uses a mix. But without knowing, maybe it's better to resolve by keeping the HEAD version. Alternatively, the user might expect the resolver to pick one. Alternatively, perhaps the correct resolution is to have the assertion that uses the method that actually exists in the BinaryAttachment class. If getContentType() is a method that exists, then the assertEquals is correct. If the assertion in HEAD is using a custom Matcher that checks the content type, that's also valid. But without knowing the implementation of BinaryAttachment, it's hard. Therefore, the intent is ambiguous, so according to the instructions, the conflict should remain. Wait, but the user wants a resolution if possible. Alternatively, maybe both assertions are correct and the conflict can be resolved by choosing one. But how to decide? Since I'm supposed to resolve semantically, and both are correct, perhaps either is acceptable. But the user might prefer the assertion style. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to use the HEAD version. Therefore, I'll resolve the conflict by selecting the HEAD version. But wait, the user's instruction says if unsure, return the conflict. But if I can determine that both achieve the same intent, then resolve. So the answer would be to pick one of them. Alternatively, maybe the code should have both assertions? But that's unlikely. Therefore, the correct resolution is to choose the HEAD's assertion because it's using a more descriptive assertion method, assuming that the project uses AssertJ. So I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the HEAD line and removing the conflict markers.</think>

    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.json", attachmentData.getBytes());
