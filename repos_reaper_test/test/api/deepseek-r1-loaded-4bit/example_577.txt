Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in a Java method that deals with getting a name from a binary attachment. The two versions differ in how they find the file extension index.

In the HEAD version, they're using name.lastIndexOf(".") with a double-quoted string, which is a string containing a period. The other side, from commit a17acec, uses name.lastIndexOf('.') with a single quote, which is a character. 

Wait, in Java, the lastIndexOf method can take either a String or a char. So using '.' as a char is more efficient because it doesn't require creating a String object. That's probably why the second change was madeâ€”to optimize by using a char instead of a String.

So the conflict is about whether to use a String or a char for the period. The semantic intent of both changes is the same: find the last occurrence of the period to split the filename. The a17acec commit is just a minor optimization. 

Since using the char is more efficient and doesn't change the functionality, the correct resolution is to take the version from a17acec, replacing the double-quoted "." with a single-quoted '.'.

I should make sure there are no other differences. The rest of the code is the same. So the resolved line should be int fileExtensionIndex = name.lastIndexOf('.');.

No ambiguity here. Both sides are trying to achieve the same thing, one is just more efficient. So the merge conflict can be resolved by choosing the char version.</think>
```java
    if (binaryAttachment.getFieldName() != null) {
      return binaryAttachment.getFieldName();
    }

    String name = binaryAttachment.getFilename();
    int fileExtensionIndex = name.lastIndexOf('.');
    return fileExtensionIndex > 0 ? name.substring(0, fileExtensionIndex) : name;
  }

  /**
   * returns if the binary attachment stream is closed automatically
