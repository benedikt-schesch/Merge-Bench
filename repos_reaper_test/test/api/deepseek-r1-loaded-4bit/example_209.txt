Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code has two versions in the conflicting area. The HEAD version adds a log method that logs an error with the arguments. The other side, from commit 1488b22, adds an isEnabled method that returns false by default and also a log method similar to HEAD's.

Wait, both sides have a log method with the same signature. The HEAD version is in the middle of the conflict, and the other side has it after their isEnabled method. But in the original code after the conflict markers, there's another log method already present. That seems like a duplication.

So the problem is that both branches added methods. The HEAD added log and the other branch added isEnabled and log. But when merging, the log method from both branches would conflict. However, looking at the code after the conflict markers, there's already a log method defined again. That might be a mistake. Maybe the original code had the log method, and both branches modified it, leading to a conflict.

Wait, let me parse the code again. The original snippet shows:

After the createSocketImpl method, there's the conflict between HEAD's log method and the other branch's isEnabled method. Then, outside the conflict markers, there's another log method with the same implementation. So the user probably has a duplication here because of merging.

The correct resolution would be to include both methods: the isEnabled from one branch and the log method from either, but since both log methods are the same, we can keep one. However, in the conflict, the HEAD version has the log method above the conflict, and the other branch has the isEnabled and log. But after the conflict, there's another log method. So maybe during the merge, the user ended up with duplicate log methods.

So the correct resolution is to take both the isEnabled method from the incoming branch and the log method from HEAD, but ensure that the log method is only present once. However, in the current code, after the conflict markers, the log method is duplicated. So the resolver needs to remove the duplicate.

Looking at the original code:

<<<<<<< HEAD
	public void log(int arg0, String arg1) {
		log.error(arg0 + ": " + arg1);
	}
=======
    public boolean isEnabled(int arg0) {
        // Default to not logging anything
        return false;
    }
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309

    public void log(int arg0, String arg1) {
        log.error(arg0 + ": " + arg1);
    }

So after resolving the conflict, the correct code should include both isEnabled and log, but without duplicating the log method. The conflict arises because both branches added a log method. However, the log methods are identical, so merging them would just keep one. But in the current setup, the code after the conflict markers has the log method again, leading to duplication.

Therefore, the correct merge is to include the isEnabled method from the other branch and the log method from HEAD, but remove the duplicate log method that's outside the conflict markers. But in the user's provided code, the log method after the conflict is already present, which is a duplication. So the resolved code should have both methods: isEnabled and log, but only one instance of log.

Wait, but in the original code, after the conflict markers, there's another log method. So perhaps during the merge, the user's code ended up with both versions of the log method: one inside the conflict and one outside. That's a mistake. So the correct way is to take the isEnabled method from the incoming branch, and keep the log method from either, but only once. Since both log methods are the same, it doesn't matter which one is kept. But looking at the code structure, the log method in the HEAD is before the conflict, and the incoming branch's log is after the isEnabled. However, the code after the conflict has another log method. So that's a duplication.

The user's current code after the conflict has:

public SocketImpl createSocketImpl() {
    return new SSHSocketImpl(session);
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
    public void log(...) {...}
=======
    public boolean isEnabled(...) {...}
>>>>>>>

    public void log(...) {...}

So after resolving, the code should have isEnabled and log, but only one log. So the correct merge would be to take the isEnabled from the incoming branch and the log from either, but without duplicating. Therefore, the resolved code would be:

public SocketImpl createSocketImpl() {
    return new SSHSocketImpl(session);
}

    public boolean isEnabled(int arg0) {
        // Default to not logging anything
        return false;
    }

    public void log(int arg0, String arg1) {
        log.error(arg0 + ": " + arg1);
    }

But in the original code, the log method is present twice. So the user probably needs to remove the duplicate. Therefore, the resolved code should merge both methods, keeping isEnabled and log once. So the conflict markers should be replaced with both methods, and the duplicate log method removed.

So the final code after resolution would include both isEnabled and log, but only one log method. In the original code, after the conflict, there's an extra log method, which is a mistake. Therefore, the correct resolution is to include both methods from both branches and remove the duplicate log.</think>
