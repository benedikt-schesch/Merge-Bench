Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the constructor for SpriteBatch. One side uses this.mBitmapTexture and the other uses this.mBitmapTextureAtlas. 

First, I need to understand what each change is doing. The HEAD version is passing mBitmapTexture, while the other branch is using mBitmapTextureAtlas. Are these two different variables, or maybe a rename? 

I should check if the rest of the code uses either of these variables elsewhere. If the rest of the code after the conflict uses mBitmapTextureAtlas, then maybe the correct one is the latter. Alternatively, maybe one branch renamed the variable.

Looking at the surrounding code, the method parameters and other variables: the texture region is from mFaceTextureRegion, which might be part of a texture atlas. Typically, a TextureAtlas contains multiple regions, so if mBitmapTextureAtlas is the atlas, that's probably the correct one. The other branch might have an older variable name, mBitmapTexture, which was replaced by mBitmapTextureAtlas in a refactor.

So, the correct line should use mBitmapTextureAtlas. Therefore, the merge conflict should be resolved by choosing the second option from the conflicting branches.</think>
```java
	private void drawUsingSpriteBatch(final Scene scene) {
		final int width = this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth();
		final int height = this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight();

		final SpriteBatch spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, SPRITE_COUNT);
		spriteBatch.setBlendFunction(GL10.GL_ONE, GL10.GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
		for(int i = 0; i < SPRITE_COUNT; i++) {
			final float x = this.mRandom.nextFloat() * (CAMERA_WIDTH - 32);
			final float y = this.mRandom.nextFloat() * (CAMERA_HEIGHT - 32);
			spriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, x, y, width, height);
``` 

Rationale: The conflict appears to be about whether to use `mBitmapTexture` or `mBitmapTextureAtlas`. The texture atlas version is more likely correct as:
1. Texture atlases are standard for batch rendering
2. The texture region (`mFaceTextureRegion`) suggests we're using atlas coordinates
3. The variable name `mBitmapTextureAtlas` follows common naming conventions for atlas references
4. This appears to be a logical rename/refactor rather than conflicting features
