Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code in question is within an if block that checks if showRoundLinkProvider.get() is true. The conflict is between the HEAD version and the branch version of the ROUND_PERMALINK line.

In the HEAD version, the line is split into two lines with the String.format call on the next line. The branch version has the same code but written in a single line. The content of both versions seems identical; the only difference is the formatting—line breaks versus a single line.

Since both changes are trying to achieve the same thing—adding the ROUND_PERMALINK to the data—the intent is the same. The conflict arises from code style differences. The correct resolution would be to choose one formatting style. However, since the user didn't specify a preference, the safest approach is to pick the more concise single-line version to minimize changes, or perhaps keep the original formatting from one side.

Wait, but the user instructions say to consider the intent and semantics. Since both versions are semantically the same, just formatted differently, resolving by taking either version is acceptable. But maybe the branch version (single line) is a refactor to make the code cleaner. Alternatively, the HEAD version might have been split for readability.

But without additional context on coding style guidelines, it's hard to say. However, the user wants the conflict resolved if possible. Since there's no functional difference, I can resolve the conflict by choosing one. Maybe the single-line is better as it's more concise. So remove the conflict markers and keep the single-line version from the branch.</think>
