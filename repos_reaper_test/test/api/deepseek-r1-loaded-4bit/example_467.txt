<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided a Java code snippet with a merge conflict. My task is to resolve it by understanding the intent of both sides. 

Looking at the conflict, the HEAD version has a method startTomcat with parameters (int port, String jvmRoute, LoginType loginType). The other branch has a method with parameters (int port, SessionAffinityMode sessionAffinityMode, String jvmRoute, LoginType loginType). 

The original method before the conflict was startTomcat with parameters (int port, SessionAffinityMode, String jvmRoute, LoginType). The HEAD version might have added a new overload without SessionAffinityMode, or maybe it's a modification. Wait, the first method is startTomcat with port and jvmRoute, calling the 4-parameter version with SessionAffinityMode.STICKY. Then the conflict is in the second method.

The HEAD version's method has three parameters, while the other branch's method has four, including sessionAffinityMode. Also, the method body differs: HEAD uses getTestUtils().createCatalina, while the other uses createCatalina directly. Also, the other branch's method sets sticky based on sessionAffinityMode.

So the conflict arises because one side added a parameter (sessionAffinityMode) and modified the method body, while the other might have a different parameter list and a different way of creating the Embedded instance.

To resolve this, I need to combine both changes. The method should include the sessionAffinityMode parameter as that seems to be part of the method's signature in the other branch. Also, the createCatalina call needs to be reconciled. The HEAD uses getTestUtils().createCatalina, while the other branch uses createCatalina directly. Which one is correct? Maybe the other branch's version is correct if createCatalina is a method in the same class. But maybe the HEAD's version is using a utility method. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But since the user said to preserve intent, perhaps the correct approach is to keep the parameters from both, but the method in conflict has different parameters. Wait, the HEAD version's method is startTomcat with three parameters (port, jvmRoute, loginType), while the other branch's method has four parameters (port, sessionAffinityMode, jvmRoute, loginType). These are two different overloads. Wait, no—the original method before the conflict was:

private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute ) throws ... {
    return startTomcat( port, SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, jvmRoute, null );
}

Then the conflicting methods are overloads. Wait, no. The first method calls startTomcat with four parameters. So the original code probably had a method with four parameters. Then, in the conflict, the HEAD version has a method with three parameters (port, jvmRoute, loginType) which might be a new overload, while the other branch has a method with four parameters (port, sessionAffinityMode, jvmRoute, loginType). Wait, that can't be right because the original method's overload is already calling a four-parameter method. So perhaps the conflict is between two versions of the same method. Let me check the method signatures again.

HEAD's method:
private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws ...

Other branch's method:
private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final SessionAffinityMode sessionAffinityMode, final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws ...

These are different method signatures. The HEAD version has three parameters, the other has four. So they are different overloads. But how does this fit with the existing code? The original code had a method that calls startTomcat with four parameters, which would match the other branch's version. So maybe the HEAD version is adding a new overload with three parameters (port, jvmRoute, loginType), while the other branch is modifying the existing four-parameter method. However, the conflict is in the same method. Wait, looking at the code, the conflict markers are around the same method. So in the current state, the two branches have modified the same method in conflicting ways. 

Wait, the original code before the conflict had a method with parameters (port, jvmRoute) which calls the four-parameter method. Then, in the conflict area, the HEAD version has a method with three parameters (port, jvmRoute, loginType), which is probably a new overload. The other branch's version is a method with four parameters (port, sessionAffinityMode, jvmRoute, loginType), which is another overload. But the way the conflict is presented, the two versions are conflicting in the same method. That suggests that both branches modified the same method. But that's impossible unless the method signature was the same in both branches. Wait, maybe in the original code, there was a method with four parameters, and one branch changed it to three parameters while the other added a parameter. But that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the HEAD branch added a new overload with three parameters, and the other branch modified an existing method with four parameters. But in the code snippet provided, the conflict is between two versions of the same method. Let me look again.

The code snippet shows:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        final Embedded tomcat = getTestUtils().createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );
=======
    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final SessionAffinityMode sessionAffinityMode,
            final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        final Embedded tomcat = createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );
>>>>>>> 6c5fb5474dc66d5ab104a5546f43f05b75a4aaa2

So both sides are defining a method with the same name but different parameters. The HEAD version has three parameters (port, jvmRoute, loginType), and the other has four (port, sessionAffinityMode, jvmRoute, loginType). However, the method in the conflict is the same line numbers, which suggests that both branches modified the same method. But that can't be unless the method signature was the same before. Wait, perhaps the original method in the base version had a different signature, and each branch changed it differently. For example, perhaps the original method had four parameters, and HEAD removed one (sessionAffinityMode) while the other branch kept it but changed the method body. But how can that be resolved?

Alternatively, maybe the HEAD version is adding a new method, but the conflict markers are around the same method. Wait, no—the code shows that both versions are modifying the same method. So this is a conflict because the two branches have different signatures for the same method. 

The correct resolution would be to determine which parameters are needed. Looking at the original method that calls startTomcat with four parameters (port, SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, jvmRoute, null), it's possible that the four-parameter method is necessary. The HEAD version's method has three parameters and uses getTestUtils().createCatalina, while the other branch's method has four parameters and uses createCatalina directly. The original method in the code before the conflict is calling the four-parameter version, so if the other branch's version is adding the sessionAffinityMode parameter, that might be necessary. 

Wait, the original code's first method is:

private Embedded startTomcat( int port, String jvmRoute ) ... {
    return startTomcat( port, SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, jvmRoute, null );
}

This is calling a method with four parameters: port, SessionAffinityMode, jvmRoute, and null (which is LoginType). So the four-parameter method must exist. The conflict is in the definition of that four-parameter method. 

But in the HEAD version, the method being defined has three parameters (port, jvmRoute, loginType), which doesn't match. The other branch's version has four parameters (port, sessionAffinityMode, jvmRoute, loginType). So the conflict is because the HEAD version changed the four-parameter method to three parameters, while the other branch kept it as four parameters but modified the body. 

Wait, no. The original code's first method is calling startTomcat with four parameters, which suggests that prior to the conflict, there was a four-parameter method. The HEAD version has a three-parameter method, which would be a different overload. But the other branch's version is a four-parameter method. So perhaps the conflict is because both branches added methods with the same name but different parameters. However, in the code provided, the conflict markers are around the same lines, which implies that the same method is being modified. 

This is confusing. Let me try to reconstruct the scenario. 

Original code before any changes:

private Embedded startTomcat(int port, String jvmRoute) ... {
    return startTomcat(port, SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, jvmRoute, null);
}

private Embedded startTomcat(int port, SessionAffinityMode sessionAffinityMode, String jvmRoute, LoginType loginType) ... {
    // original implementation
}

Then, in the HEAD branch, someone changed the four-parameter method to a three-parameter method (port, jvmRoute, loginType), perhaps removing the sessionAffinityMode parameter. Meanwhile, in the other branch, the four-parameter method was modified, perhaps changing how it creates the Embedded instance (using createCatalina directly instead of getTestUtils().createCatalina). 

But the original first method is still calling the four-parameter method. So if the HEAD branch removes the sessionAffinityMode parameter from the four-parameter method, that would cause a problem because the original method's call would no longer compile. Therefore, the HEAD branch's change is incorrect. The other branch's change adds the sessionAffinityMode parameter and modifies the method body. 

Wait, but the HEAD version's method has three parameters, which can't be the same as the original four-parameter method. So perhaps in the HEAD branch, the four-parameter method was removed or changed to three parameters, leading to a conflict when merging with the other branch's changes to the four-parameter method. 

This is a tricky conflict. To resolve it, we need to preserve both changes if possible. However, since the method signatures are different, they are separate overloads. But the conflict markers suggest that both branches modified the same method. Therefore, perhaps the correct resolution is to keep both methods. But the way the code is structured, the conflict is within the same method. 

Alternatively, maybe the HEAD branch intended to add a new overload with three parameters, and the other branch modified the existing four-parameter method. In that case, both methods can coexist. But the conflict markers may be due to the same code block being modified. 

Wait, looking at the code:

The original code has two methods. The first is the two-parameter method that calls the four-parameter one. Then, the conflicting code is for another method. The HEAD version has a three-parameter method, and the other branch has a four-parameter method. So these are two different methods. But the conflict is occurring because both branches added or modified methods in the same location. 

Wait, perhaps the original code had only the two-parameter method and the four-parameter method. Then, the HEAD branch added a three-parameter method, while the other branch modified the four-parameter method. But in the code provided, the conflict is in the same line numbers, so the two branches are trying to modify the same method. That suggests that the original code had a four-parameter method, and the HEAD branch changed it to a three-parameter method, while the other branch modified the four-parameter method. This would cause a conflict because the method signature was changed in HEAD but modified in the other branch. 

In this case, to resolve the conflict, we need to decide which changes to keep. The correct approach would be to retain the four-parameter method from the other branch because the original two-parameter method depends on it. The HEAD branch's three-parameter method could be an additional overload. However, the conflict is in the same method, so maybe the two branches are conflicting on the same method's signature. 

Alternatively, perhaps the HEAD branch's three-parameter method is intended to be a new overload, and the other branch's four-parameter method is a modification of the existing one. In that case, both methods can coexist. But the conflict markers are around the same code lines, so they must be part of the same method. 

This is confusing. Let me try to approach it differently. 

The other branch's method has four parameters, including sessionAffinityMode. The method body uses createCatalina and sets the sticky mode based on sessionAffinityMode. The HEAD version's method has three parameters and uses getTestUtils().createCatalina. 

The original two-parameter method calls the four-parameter version. So if the four-parameter method is changed to three parameters, the original method's call would break. Therefore, the HEAD branch's change is incorrect. The other branch's change is correct, as it maintains the four-parameter method but modifies its implementation. 

Therefore, the correct resolution is to accept the other branch's four-parameter method, and perhaps the HEAD branch's three-parameter method is a new overload. However, the conflict is in the same code block, so maybe the HEAD branch removed a parameter, leading to a conflict. 

Wait, the original code's two-parameter method calls the four-parameter method. If the HEAD branch changes the four-parameter method to three parameters, then the original method's call would have four arguments, leading to a compile error. Therefore, the HEAD branch's change is not compatible. Hence, the other branch's version is correct. 

But why does the HEAD version have a three-parameter method? Maybe the HEAD branch intended to add a new method with three parameters, but accidentally modified the existing four-parameter one. 

Alternatively, maybe the conflict is due to the other branch adding a parameter to the method, while the HEAD branch removed a parameter. 

In this case, the correct resolution would be to keep the four-parameter method from the other branch, as the original code depends on it, and perhaps the HEAD branch's changes are conflicting. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. 

Looking at the method bodies:

HEAD version:
final Embedded tomcat = getTestUtils().createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );

Other branch:
final Embedded tomcat = createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );

Assuming that createCatalina is a method in the current class, while getTestUtils().createCatalina is a different approach. Which one is correct? Without context, it's hard to say, but perhaps the other branch's version is correct if they refactored to call createCatalina directly. 

Additionally, the other branch's method sets the sticky mode based on sessionAffinityMode, which is a parameter. The HEAD version's method doesn't have that parameter, so it can't set the sticky mode correctly. Therefore, the other branch's version is more complete. 

Putting it all together, the correct resolution is to keep the four-parameter method from the other branch, including the sessionAffinityMode parameter, and use createCatalina directly. The HEAD version's three-parameter method might be an overload, but since the conflict is in the same method, perhaps the three-parameter method was intended to be a new method. However, given the conflict markers, the correct approach is to merge the four-parameter version and discard the HEAD's three-parameter version. 

But the user said to return the entire snippet with the conflict resolved. So the resolved code should have the four-parameter method from the other branch, with the createCatalina call and the sessionAffinityMode parameter. The HEAD's three-parameter method is conflicting, so unless it's a valid overload, it shouldn't be there. 

Wait, but the original two-parameter method calls the four-parameter method. If the four-parameter method is preserved, then that's correct. The three-parameter method in the HEAD might be a new overload that's intended to exist. But in the code provided, the conflict is between two versions of the same method. Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the four-parameter method from the other branch, and possibly keep the three-parameter method as a separate overload if it's intended. But how? 

Alternatively, perhaps the HEAD's three-parameter method is a mistake, and the correct method is the four-parameter one. 

In that case, the resolved code should have the four-parameter method from the other branch, and the HEAD's three-parameter method should be removed or merged. 

But the user said to preserve context and spacing. The original code has the two-parameter method and then the conflicting method. 

So the final resolved code should have:

- The original two-parameter method.
- The four-parameter method from the other branch, which includes sessionAffinityMode and uses createCatalina directly.
- The three-parameter method from HEAD is conflicting, but since it's a different signature, perhaps it's an overload. However, since the conflict markers are around the same method, it's likely that the two branches modified the same method, leading to a conflict. 

Wait, but the method signatures are different, so they are different methods. Therefore, the conflict is because both branches added methods with different signatures in the same place. 

But in the code provided, the conflict is between the two method definitions. So in the original code, there was only one method in that spot, and both branches added a new method in the same location. Therefore, the conflict is between two different methods. 

In that case, the correct resolution is to keep both methods. So the resolved code would have:

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        return startTomcat( port, SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, jvmRoute, null );
    }

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        final Embedded tomcat = getTestUtils().createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );
        tomcat.start();
        getManager( tomcat ).setSticky( sessionAffinityMode.isSticky() );
        return tomcat;
    }

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final SessionAffinityMode sessionAffinityMode,
            final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        final Embedded tomcat = createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );
        tomcat.start();
        getManager( tomcat ).setSticky( sessionAffinityMode.isSticky() );
        return tomcat;
    }

But that's not possible because Java doesn't allow two methods with the same name and parameter count unless the parameter types differ. The three-parameter method has (int, String, LoginType), and the four-parameter method has (int, SessionAffinityMode, String, LoginType). So they are different overloads. However, the original two-parameter method calls the four-parameter one. So if both methods are present, that's okay. 

But the conflict markers in the original code suggest that both branches added a method in the same location, leading to a conflict. Therefore, the resolution is to include both methods. However, the code provided in the conflict is between two versions of the same method, which is impossible because their signatures are different. Therefore, this must be a merge conflict where both branches added a new method with the same name but different parameters in the same location. 

In that case, the correct resolution is to keep both methods. However, the way the conflict is presented, it's between two method definitions. So the resolved code should have both methods. 

But in the original code, the two-parameter method calls the four-parameter method. If the four-parameter method is present (from the other branch), then that's correct. The three-parameter method from HEAD is a new overload. 

But looking at the code after resolution:

The original two-parameter method calls startTomcat with four parameters. The other branch's four-parameter method is present, so that's okay. The HEAD's three-parameter method is an additional overload. 

Therefore, the resolved code should include both methods. However, the conflict markers are around the same lines, which suggests that the two methods were added in the same place. So the correct resolution is to place both methods one after the other. 

But the user's instruction is to return the entire snippet with the conflict resolved. So the final code should have both methods. 

Wait, but how? Because the conflict is between the two method definitions. 

The original code has:

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        return startTomcat( port, SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, jvmRoute, null );
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws ... {
        // HEAD's code
=======
    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final SessionAffinityMode sessionAffinityMode,
            final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws ... {
        // Other branch's code
>>>>>>> ...

    }

So the conflict is between adding a three-parameter method and a four-parameter method in the same spot. Therefore, the correct resolution is to include both methods. However, in Java, methods are overloaded based on parameter lists. So both can coexist. 

Therefore, the resolved code should have:

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        return startTomcat( port, SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, jvmRoute, null );
    }

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        final Embedded tomcat = getTestUtils().createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );
        tomcat.start();
        getManager( tomcat ).setSticky( sessionAffinityMode.isSticky() );
        return tomcat;
    }

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final SessionAffinityMode sessionAffinityMode,
            final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        final Embedded tomcat = createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );
        tomcat.start();
        getManager( tomcat ).setSticky( sessionAffinityMode.isSticky() );
        return tomcat;
    }

But wait, the original code already had a four-parameter method. The other branch's version is modifying that four-parameter method, while the HEAD version is adding a three-parameter method. But the conflict is between the two method definitions. 

Alternatively, maybe the HEAD version intended to modify the four-parameter method into a three-parameter one, but that's conflicting with the other branch's changes to the four-parameter method. In that case, it's a conflict that can't be automatically resolved. 

But based on the user's instruction to think about the semantics, the four-parameter method is necessary for the original two-parameter method to work. Therefore, the other branch's version must be preserved. The HEAD's three-parameter method might be a new overload, but if it's conflicting with the four-parameter method's existence, it's possible that the three-parameter method is a mistake. 

Alternatively, the three-parameter method in HEAD could be calling the four-parameter method with a default sessionAffinityMode. For example:

private Embedded startTomcat(int port, String jvmRoute, LoginType loginType) {
    return startTomcat(port, SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, jvmRoute, loginType);
}

But in the HEAD version's code, it's not doing that. Instead, it's creating the tomcat instance and setting sticky based on sessionAffinityMode, which is not present in the parameters. Wait, in the HEAD version's method, there's a line:

getManager( tomcat ).setSticky( sessionAffinityMode.isSticky() );

But sessionAffinityMode is not a parameter in the HEAD version's method. That's a compile error. Because in the HEAD version's method, sessionAffinityMode is not defined. So that's a mistake. The HEAD version's code has an error because it's referencing sessionAffinityMode, which is not present in the parameters. 

Ah, that's a key point. The HEAD version's method has a reference to sessionAffinityMode, but it's not declared as a parameter. That's a bug. The other branch's version correctly includes sessionAffinityMode as a parameter and uses it. 

Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the other branch's version of the method, which includes the sessionAffinityMode parameter and correctly uses it. The HEAD version's code is erroneous because it references an undefined variable. 

Therefore, the resolved code should use the other branch's method, and the HEAD's version should be discarded. 

But why does the HEAD version's method have that line? It's possible that the HEAD branch intended to have the sessionAffinityMode parameter but mistakenly omitted it. 

Given that, the correct resolution is to keep the four-parameter method from the other branch, as it's the only correct version that doesn't have a compile error. The HEAD version's method has an error and should be discarded. 

Therefore, the final resolved code should be:

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        return startTomcat( port, SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, jvmRoute, null );
    }

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final SessionAffinityMode sessionAffinityMode,
            final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        final Embedded tomcat = createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );
        tomcat.start();
        getManager( tomcat ).setSticky( sessionAffinityMode.isSticky() );
        return tomcat;
    }

But wait, the other branch's code uses createCatalina directly, while the HEAD version uses getTestUtils().createCatalina. Which one is correct? It depends on the context. If createCatalina is a helper method in the current class, then using it directly is fine. If getTestUtils() returns a utility class that has createCatalina, then that's also valid. Without more context, it's hard to say, but since the other branch's version is part of their change, and it's correct in their context, we should keep it. 

Also, the original code's two-parameter method calls the four-parameter method with SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, which is present in the other branch's version. 

Therefore, the resolved code should take the other branch's version of the method, discarding the HEAD's version. 

Thus, the final answer is to resolve the conflict by choosing the other branch's method, resulting in the four-parameter method with sessionAffinityMode, and the createCatalina call without getTestUtils().</think>
