Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The conflict is in the static imports of a Java file. The HEAD version has an import for pushImageTag, while the other branch (7e96d6f) imports writeImageInfoFile instead. 

First, I need to understand what each side is doing. Both imports are from the same Utils class, so they're likely related to Docker image handling. The HEAD branch adds pushImageTag, which might be for pushing specific image tags. The other branch adds writeImageInfoFile, which could write image information to a file.

Since these are static imports, they're probably used in the code that follows. If both methods are needed, the correct resolution is to include both imports. But maybe the methods were renamed or replaced. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if one replaces the other or if they serve different purposes.

If the intent is to keep both functionalities, then both imports should stay. But in the conflict, only one is present in each branch. The user might have added one in each branch, so merging both would be correct. However, Java doesn't allow duplicate static imports, but here the imports are different. So, combining both by adding both lines would resolve the conflict without issues.

So, the resolved code should include both pushImageTag and writeImageInfoFile imports. The order might not matter, but keeping them in the order they appeared, perhaps HEAD first then the other. So the conflict markers are removed, and both imports are included.</think>
