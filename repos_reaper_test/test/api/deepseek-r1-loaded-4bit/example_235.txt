<think>
Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict. Let's look at the code. The conflict is in the comment line. The HEAD version says "could on a different instance" and the other branch says "count on a different instance". 

Hmm, "could" doesn't make sense here. The correct phrase should be "count on", meaning relying on another instance. So the second version is correct. The typo in HEAD is probably a mistake.

So I'll choose the version from the 1488b22ce3 commit. Replace the conflict markers with "count on a different instance". Make sure the rest of the code stays the same. No other changes needed. The context before and after the conflict lines remains untouched. That should resolve it.</think>
```java

    public void bindTo(String fileName, BufferedPositionedInputStream in, long offset, long end) throws IOException {
        this.in = in;
        this.end = end;
        // Since we are not block aligned we throw away the first
        // record and count on a different instance to read it
        if (offset != 0)
            getNext();
    }

    public Tuple getNext() throws IOException {

```
