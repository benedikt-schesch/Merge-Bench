<think>
Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code snippet. Let me look at what's going on here. The conflict is in the Javadoc comment for the 'mode' parameter. 

In the HEAD version, there's a @required annotation added, while the other branch (40fa077) doesn't have that. The question is whether the @required parameter is necessary here. 

The original code had a @parameter default-value="TXT". The HEAD added @required, which might mean that the parameter must be provided by the user. But wait, if there's a default value, then the parameter isn't actually required because it can fall back to "TXT". So adding @required here could be conflicting because the default value already ensures it's not null.

Maybe the person who added @required didn't realize that a default value makes it unnecessary. Or perhaps they intended to enforce that the user must explicitly set the mode, but the default value contradicts that. That's a semantic conflict. 

Since the default value is present, the @required annotation is redundant and possibly incorrect. The correct resolution would be to remove the @required line to maintain consistency with the default value. So the merged code should keep the default-value but not include @required. Therefore, the conflict markers should be removed, keeping the version without @required.</think>
```java
public class Args4jUsageMojo extends AbstractMojo {

    /**
     * Mode. 'TXT' 'XML' or 'HTML'
     * @parameter default-value="TXT"
     */
    private String mode;

    /**
     * Location of the source files.
