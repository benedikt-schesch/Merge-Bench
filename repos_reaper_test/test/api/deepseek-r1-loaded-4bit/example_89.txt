<think>
Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The user provided a Java code snippet with conflicts. The task is to resolve them by understanding the intent of both branches without altering the surrounding context.

First, I see two conflicts. The first one is between `@ServerDiscoveryPort` and `@AllowBlankCards`. The second conflict is in the next `@BindingAnnotation`, but the HEAD side has an extra line after the annotation, while the other branch doesn't.

Wait, the second conflict might be a result of the first one. Let me check the structure. The code has two @BindingAnnotation declarations. The first conflict is replacing one annotation with another. The second conflict seems to be about whitespace—HEAD has an empty line after the annotation, and the other branch doesn't. But actually, looking closer, the second conflict markers are under the second @BindingAnnotation. Wait, no—the code shows that after resolving the first conflict, the next @BindingAnnotation is in both branches but with different annotations? Wait no, let me re-express the code structure.

Original code:

```
  public @interface BannedNicks {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
=======
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

Wait, the second conflict is actually in the same area. Wait, no—the first conflict is about the annotation `ServerDiscoveryPort` vs `AllowBlankCards`. Then, after that, there's another `@BindingAnnotation` block, but in the HEAD version, there's an extra line after `@Retention`, while the other branch doesn't have that. Or maybe the second conflict is part of the same block? Wait, no. Let me parse this again.

Looking at the code:

After the first conflict (the one with ServerDiscoveryPort vs AllowBlankCards), there's another @BindingAnnotation block. The HEAD version has:

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD

So after the @Retention line, there's a line with <<<<<<< HEAD, but then the other side (ed08e37) has... Wait, perhaps the second conflict is part of the same code? Wait, no. Let me re-express the code as provided.

The original code snippet is:

```java
  public @interface BannedNicks {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
=======
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

So the first conflict is between ServerDiscoveryPort and AllowBlankCards. The second conflict is in the next @BindingAnnotation block. But in the HEAD, after @Retention, there's a line with <<<<<<< HEAD, but the other side's code isn't shown here. Wait, maybe the second conflict is incomplete? Because the code provided only shows the HEAD side for the second conflict. The user's example cuts off here, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the second conflict is only present in the HEAD, and the other branch doesn't have that part. But the user's code snippet shows that after the first resolved conflict, there's another @BindingAnnotation with a conflict marker. But the code after that is only showing the HEAD part. Maybe the second conflict is actually a separate one, but the user's example is truncated.

But in the given code, the second conflict starts with <<<<<<< HEAD under another @BindingAnnotation. So perhaps in the HEAD branch, after resolving the first conflict, there's another annotation being added, while in the other branch, that part is different or not present.

But given that the user's code snippet is incomplete, perhaps the second conflict is just an empty line. Wait, looking at the code:

After the first conflict's resolution, the next lines are:

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD

So in HEAD, after the @Retention line, there's a line with <<<<<<< HEAD, but no corresponding ======= or >>>>>>>. But that can't be correct. It's possible that the code provided by the user is incomplete or has a typo.

Wait, perhaps the user's code snippet has two separate conflicts. The first is between ServerDiscoveryPort and AllowBlankCards. The second is a new @BindingAnnotation that in HEAD has some content, but in the other branch, it's different. However, in the code provided, the second conflict only shows the HEAD side. That suggests that maybe in the other branch, that part is missing, or perhaps there's a typo in the conflict markers.

Alternatively, maybe the user pasted the code incorrectly, and the second conflict is missing its other side. For example, perhaps it should have:

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public @interface SomeOtherAnnotation {
=======
  public @interface AnotherAnnotation {
>>>>>>> ...

But in the given code, after the second @BindingAnnotation block, there's only the HEAD marker and nothing else. That would be an invalid conflict. However, given the user's input, perhaps the second conflict is incomplete. In that case, since the conflict markers are not properly formed, it's ambiguous.

But according to the user's code snippet, after resolving the first conflict, there's another conflict starting with <<<<<<< HEAD but no closing ======= or >>>>>>>. That's invalid. However, perhaps it's a mistake in the user's example. Let's proceed with what's given.

The task is to resolve the conflicts, preserving context. The first conflict is straightforward: two different annotations are being declared in each branch. The question is whether both annotations are needed or if they are conflicting changes. Since they are different names, it's possible that both branches added a new annotation, and the correct resolution is to keep both. However, in the code, the annotations are in the same location. So perhaps one branch added @ServerDiscoveryPort, and the other added @AllowBlankCards in the same place. That's a conflict because Git can't merge them automatically.

So the user needs to decide whether both annotations should be present. However, in Java, you can't have two annotations with the same name in the same scope, but here they're different names. Wait, but the code shows that in the same spot, one branch has ServerDiscoveryPort and the other has AllowBlankCards. So the user probably intended to add two separate annotations, but they were added in the same place in both branches, leading to a conflict.

In such a case, the correct resolution would be to include both annotations, each in their own @BindingAnnotation block. But how? Let's look at the surrounding code.

Looking at the code:

Original code has:

public @interface BannedNicks {
}

Then, the conflicting part is between:

@BindingAnnotation
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD
public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
=======
public @interface AllowBlankCards {
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
}

Then, after that, there's another @BindingAnnotation block with a conflict.

Wait, perhaps the second @BindingAnnotation block is actually part of the same merge conflict? No, the markers are separate. So in the HEAD branch, after adding ServerDiscoveryPort, there's another @BindingAnnotation, while in the other branch, after adding AllowBlankCards, there's a different or no annotation.

But the code as presented shows that after the first conflict, the next lines are:

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD

Which suggests that in the HEAD branch, there's another annotation being defined here, but the other branch (ed08e37) might have something else or nothing.

But without seeing the other side of the second conflict, it's hard to resolve. However, the user's provided code snippet may be incomplete. Since the user's example cuts off after the second conflict's HEAD marker, perhaps the actual conflict is that the HEAD added an empty line after the second @Retention line, while the other branch didn't. But that's just whitespace.

Alternatively, perhaps the second conflict is about another annotation. For example, HEAD added:

@BindingAnnotation
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface AnotherAnnotation {
}

And the other branch added a different annotation in the same spot. But in the code provided, we can't see that because the snippet is incomplete.

Given that the user's code is as presented, the first conflict is between ServerDiscoveryPort and AllowBlankCards. The second conflict is only showing the HEAD side, which may be a mistake, but for the purpose of this exercise, perhaps we should consider that the second conflict is incomplete and thus cannot be resolved, so we leave it as is.

But the user's instruction says to return the entire snippet with resolved conflicts if possible, otherwise leave the conflict markers.

So for the first conflict, the user has two different annotations added in the same location. Since both are likely separate additions, the correct resolution is to include both annotations. But in Java, each annotation is a separate top-level (or nested) type. However, looking at the code, these are nested annotations (since they are declared inside a class or another interface?), but the code structure isn't entirely clear. Assuming that these are separate annotations, the correct way is to have both declarations. However, since they are in the same spot in the code, perhaps they were added by different branches, and the merge conflict arises because both modified the same lines.

Therefore, the resolution would be to keep both annotations by placing them one after the other. So instead of choosing between ServerDiscoveryPort and AllowBlankCards, both should be present. However, the way the code is structured, they are in the same block. So how to arrange that?

Looking at the code:

Original lines:

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
=======
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
  }

So the conflict is between adding ServerDiscoveryPort and AllowBlankCards in the same location. To resolve this, both annotations should be declared separately. Therefore, the correct resolution is to have both:

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
  }

But in the original code, this would mean that the merge conflict is resolved by adding both annotations, each with their own @BindingAnnotation and @Retention.

However, in the code provided, after resolving the first conflict, there's another @BindingAnnotation block with a conflict. So maybe the second conflict is actually the continuation from the first. Wait, let me re-examine the code structure.

The original code after the first conflict is:

  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
=======
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

So after resolving the first conflict (the one with ServerDiscoveryPort and AllowBlankCards), there's another @BindingAnnotation block that has a conflict in HEAD. But in the provided code, the second conflict only has the HEAD side. This could be a formatting error or an incomplete conflict.

Assuming that the second conflict is a separate one, but the other side is not shown, perhaps the user intended to have another annotation in HEAD, while the other branch doesn't have that. However, without knowing the other side, we can't resolve it. Therefore, we should leave the second conflict as is.

But the user's instruction says to return the entire snippet with conflict markers if unsure. However, the user may have intended that the second conflict is part of the same change. Alternatively, perhaps the second conflict is an artifact of a bad merge, and the actual intended code is to have both annotations.

Alternatively, perhaps the second conflict's code in the other branch is actually part of the AllowBlankCards addition. But without seeing the other side, it's impossible to know.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to resolve the first conflict by including both annotations and then check the second conflict. However, since the second conflict in the provided code only shows the HEAD side, it's unclear. Therefore, the safest approach is to resolve the first conflict by keeping both annotations and leave the second conflict as is if it's ambiguous.

Wait, but how can we include both annotations in the same code block? Let's see:

Original lines:

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
=======
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
  }

These are two different interface declarations. To resolve, we need to have both, but in separate blocks. Therefore, the correct resolution is:

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
  }

But in the original code, these are in the same location. So the merge conflict is because both branches added an annotation in the same place. Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep both, each in their own @BindingAnnotation block.

So modifying the first conflict to have both annotations, each with their own @BindingAnnotation and @Retention.

However, looking at the original code, the annotations are declared with @BindingAnnotation and @Retention. So each annotation should have those annotations. Therefore, the resolved code for the first conflict would be:

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
  }

But in the original code, the two branches are adding different annotations in the same spot, leading to the conflict. The correct resolution is to include both annotations, each with their own annotations. So the merge conflict is resolved by adding both, resulting in two separate annotation declarations.

Then, looking at the second conflict:

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD

Assuming that in HEAD, after this, there's another annotation, but in the other branch, there's nothing, or a different annotation. Since the conflict marker is incomplete, it's unclear. Therefore, this part cannot be resolved and should remain as a conflict.

Putting it all together, the resolved code would have both annotations from the first conflict and leave the second conflict as is.

But wait, the user's code after the first conflict has another @BindingAnnotation block with a conflict. Let's see:

After resolving the first conflict, the code would look like:

  public @interface BannedNicks {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD

But this is not possible, because the original code after the first conflict's closing } has another @BindingAnnotation block with a conflict. Wait, no. Let me look again.

The original code structure:

After the first conflict's resolution, the next lines are:

  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD

But this is part of the second conflict. However, the second conflict's other side is not present. Therefore, this is an invalid conflict marker. It might be a mistake in the user's example. But given that, perhaps the second conflict is a result of one branch adding another annotation and the other not, leading to an empty line.

Alternatively, perhaps the second conflict is part of the same code block, but that's unlikely.

In any case, given the ambiguity, the expert should return the resolved first conflict and leave the second as unresolved.

But according to the user's instruction, if unsure, return the same snippet with the conflict. However, the first conflict can be resolved by including both annotations. Wait, but in Java, you can't have two annotations with the same name, but here they are different names, so they can coexist. Therefore, the correct resolution for the first conflict is to have both annotations declared.

But how to structure that. Let's see:

Original conflict:

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
=======
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
  }

This suggests that in the HEAD, the user added ServerDiscoveryPort, and in the other branch, AllowBlankCards. To resolve, both should be kept. Therefore, the code should have both interfaces, each with their own @BindingAnnotation and @Retention.

But looking at the code:

The code before the conflict has:

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
=======
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
  }

This implies that both branches added an annotation in the same spot. Therefore, the correct resolution is to include both, each as separate annotations. Therefore, the resolved code would be:

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
  }

Thus, the first conflict is resolved by adding both annotations. Then, the next part:

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD

This is another conflict. Since the other side isn't provided, perhaps in the other branch, there's nothing here, or another annotation. Without knowing, it's ambiguous. Therefore, this part should remain as a conflict.

So the final resolved code would have the first conflict resolved with both annotations and the second conflict left as is.

But the user's instruction says to return the entire snippet with conflict markers if unsure. Therefore, if the second conflict is not resolvable, the answer should include it as is.

But looking at the code after resolving the first conflict, the next lines are:

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD

But there's no corresponding ======= or >>>>>>>. This suggests that the user's example has an incomplete conflict, which is a syntax error. In real Git conflicts, each conflict must have all three markers: <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>. Therefore, this might be a mistake in the user's example. If that's the case, the second conflict is invalid and cannot be resolved, so it should be left as is.

Therefore, the resolved code would have the first conflict resolved with both annotations and the second conflict left in place.

But wait, in the original code after the first conflict's closing }, there's another @BindingAnnotation block with a conflict. So the structure is:

After resolving the first conflict, the code would look like:

  public @interface BannedNicks {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD

But this leaves the second conflict as is. However, the original code after the first conflict has:

  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD

Which is part of the second conflict. But since there's no closing markers, it's invalid. Assuming that the user made a mistake and the second conflict is intended to be a complete one, but in the provided code, it's not, we can't resolve it. Therefore, the second conflict should be left as is.

But according to the user's instruction, if unsure, return the same snippet with the conflict. Therefore, the answer would include the first conflict resolved and the second left as is.

However, given that the user's example may have a typo and the second conflict is actually a continuation of the first, perhaps the second part is not a conflict but part of the same code. But that's unlikely.

In conclusion, the expert should resolve the first conflict by including both annotations and leave the second conflict as is.</think>
