Okay, let's see what we have here. The user provided a Java code snippet with a merge conflict. The task is to resolve the conflict by understanding the intent of both sides without modifying the surrounding context.

Looking at the conflict, the HEAD version has the line "PhyPlanVisitor {" indented with 8 spaces, while the other branch has it with no indentation. The rest of the code around the conflict seems the same.

I need to figure out which indentation is correct. Java doesn't care about the number of spaces for indentation, but consistency is important. The class declaration line is split into two lines. The HEAD version adds an extra 8 spaces, making the line continuation more indented, which is common in Java for line wraps. The other branch aligns it with the same level as the class declaration, which might be less common.

Looking at the surrounding code, the rest of the class uses standard indentation. The line after the conflict starts with "private Document doc..." which is at the same level as the class body. So, the correct indentation for the extends clause should be such that the line is properly aligned. Typically, in Java, when a class declaration is split across lines, the subsequent lines are indented. For example:

public class MyClass extends
        SomeOtherClass {

So, the HEAD version's indentation of 8 spaces (which is likely one level of indentation, maybe 4 or 8 spaces depending on the project's style) is more correct. The other branch's version with no indentation would make the line not indented, which is less common.

Therefore, resolving the conflict by choosing the HEAD version's indentation makes sense here. The other branch's change might have been a mistake or a different style, but given that the HEAD is more aligned with typical Java conventions, that's the way to go.</think>

public class XMLPhysicalPlanPrinter<P extends OperatorPlan<PhysicalOperator>> extends
        PhyPlanVisitor {

    private Document doc = null;
    private Element parent = null;
