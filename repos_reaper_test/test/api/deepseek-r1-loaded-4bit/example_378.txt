Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the JavaDoc comment of a class. Both sides are trying to document the HTTP Media-type with a link to the RFC. 

The HEAD version has the link inline, while the other branch (2ed19b71...) splits the href across two lines and updates the URL to use https. The comment also slightly rephrases the sentence structure.

The goal is to merge these changes without losing the intent. The key points are:
1. The URL should use https, which is more secure and up-to-date. The second version does that.
2. The formatting of the <a> tag: HEAD has it all on one line, the other splits the href. Splitting the href might be for line length or readability, which is a good practice.
3. The wording: HEAD starts with the link, the other starts with the description. Both are correct, but the second version's phrasing flows better.

So, combining both, we should take the https URL from the second version, keep the split href for readability, and use the phrasing from the second version. Also, ensure the @author and @since tags are correctly placed without any merge markers.</think>
