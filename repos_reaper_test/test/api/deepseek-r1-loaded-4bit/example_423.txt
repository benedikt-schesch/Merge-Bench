Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The conflicting sections are in the import statements of a Java file. The HEAD version has imports for OSQLSynchQuery, SystemExit, and DocumentAttributes. The other branch, 1b5691ad2a7d734321d0382e71743a85835556b3, imports DocumentModel instead.

First, I need to understand why these changes were made. The HEAD side includes classes related to OrientDB queries and JBake's system exit and document attributes. The other branch adds DocumentModel from JBake, which might be a new class introduced to handle document models, replacing or supplementing DocumentAttributes.

Looking at the surrounding context, both branches are importing classes from org.jbake.model. The HEAD version has DocumentAttributes, while the other has DocumentModel. It's possible that DocumentModel was introduced to replace DocumentAttributes, or they might serve different purposes. If DocumentModel is a new addition and DocumentAttributes is no longer used, we should keep DocumentModel. Alternatively, if both are needed, we should include both imports.

However, since it's a merge conflict in imports, maybe the two changes are independent. The HEAD might have added some functionality using SystemExit and OSQLSynchQuery, while the other branch added DocumentModel. If these are separate changes, the correct resolution is to include all necessary imports from both sides.

So, checking the classes: OSQLSynchQuery is from OrientDB's SQL queries, SystemExit from JBake launcher, DocumentAttributes from JBake model. The other branch adds DocumentModel. If the code in both branches uses these classes, the merged file should include all of them. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by combining both sets of imports, removing the conflict markers.

Therefore, the resolved import block should include all the unique imports from both branches. That means keeping OSQLSynchQuery, SystemExit, DocumentAttributes from HEAD, and adding DocumentModel from the other branch. Since DocumentModel and DocumentAttributes might both be used, they should both be present.</think>
