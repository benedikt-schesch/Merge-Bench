Okay, let me look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java code between the HEAD version and the branch version. The conflicting lines are for the AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS pattern.

First, I'll compare the two versions. The HEAD version has:
Pattern.compile("(^|[^&/" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS + "])(#|\uFF03)(" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*" + HASHTAG_ALPHA + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*)", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE | Pattern.UNICODE_CASE);

The other version (from b83625b) has:
Pattern.compile("(^|[^&/" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS + "]+)(#|\uFF03)(" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*" + HASHTAG_ALPHA + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*)", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);

So the differences are:
1. The first group in the regex: HEAD uses "])(#", the other side uses "]+)(#". So the HEAD has a single character exclusion, while the other adds a "+" quantifier, meaning one or more of those characters.
2. The flags: HEAD includes both CASE_INSENSITIVE and UNICODE_CASE, while the other only has CASE_INSENSITIVE.

Now, thinking about the intent. The AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS pattern is for matching hashtags. The first group is the "before" part, which should match characters that are not part of the hashtag. Using "+" makes sense here because it allows multiple invalid characters before the hashtag, which is more correct. For example, if there are multiple non-allowed characters, the "+" ensures they're all skipped, whereas without it, only one is skipped, which might not be intended.

Regarding the flags: CASE_INSENSITIVE alone handles ASCII case insensitivity, but UNICODE_CASE adds support for Unicode characters. If the project requires hashtags to be case-insensitive in a Unicode context (like accented characters), then both flags are needed. However, if the other branch removed UNICODE_CASE, maybe there was a reason, like avoiding unexpected behavior. But without more context, it's safer to include both flags to preserve Unicode case insensitivity, as the HEAD version does.

So combining both changes: use the "+" in the regex from the branch and keep the flags from HEAD. That way, we get the correct quantifier and the desired case handling.

Then, check the surrounding lines. The HEAD version has SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END, which the other branch doesn't touch. The other branch adds HASHTAG_MATCH_END. Both constants are present in the final code, so they should coexist.

So the resolved code should include SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END from HEAD, the corrected AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS with "+" and both flags, and HASHTAG_MATCH_END from the other branch. The constants after (GROUP_BEFORE, etc.) are the same in both, so no conflict there.</think>
```java


  /* Begin public constants */
  public static final Pattern AT_SIGNS = Pattern.compile("[" + AT_SIGNS_CHARS + "]");

  public static final Pattern SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END = Pattern.compile("^(?:[" + AT_SIGNS_CHARS + LATIN_ACCENTS_CHARS + "]|://)");

  public static final Pattern AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS = Pattern.compile("(^|[^&/" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS + "]+)(#|\uFF03)(" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*" + HASHTAG_ALPHA + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*)", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE | Pattern.UNICODE_CASE);
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_BEFORE = 1;
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_HASH = 2;
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_TAG = 3;
  public static final Pattern HASHTAG_MATCH_END = Pattern.compile("^(?:[#ï¼ƒ]|://)");
