Okay, let's see. I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code snippet. The conflict is between the HEAD version and the commit 817f114. 

Looking at the conflict markers: the HEAD side doesn't have the line `Jenkins.get().checkPermission(Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS);` while the other side adds it. The rest of the code is the same except for that line.

So, the key here is to determine if adding that permission check is necessary. The line `Jenkins.get().checkPermission(Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS);` is a security check to ensure that the user has the right permissions before executing the method. In the HEAD version, that check is missing, which could be a security issue. The other branch adds it, which is probably a correct authorization step.

Since the method `doSubmit` is handling a POST request (as indicated by `@RequirePOST`), it's crucial to have proper permission checks. The added line ensures that only users with RUN_SCRIPTS permission can submit this action. Therefore, including that line is important for security and should be kept.

The conflict arises because one branch added the permission check and the other didn't. The correct resolution is to include the check. So, the merged code should have the `Jenkins.get().checkPermission(Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS);` line from the conflicting commit, and remove the conflict markers.

I should make sure that the line is placed correctly in the method. Since it's at the beginning of the method in the conflicting commit, right after the method signature, that's the right place for such a check. It's a common practice to perform authorization checks early in the method.

No other changes are present in the conflict area. So the resolved code should include that line without any other modifications. The rest of the code remains the same as both versions agree after that line.</think>
```java
        return filePathRules.checkFileAccess(op, f);
    }

    @RequirePOST
    public HttpResponse doSubmit(StaplerRequest req) throws IOException {
        Jenkins.get().checkPermission(Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS);

        String whitelist = Util.fixNull(req.getParameter("whitelist"));
        if (!whitelist.endsWith("\n"))
            whitelist+="\n";

        Enumeration e = req.getParameterNames();
```
