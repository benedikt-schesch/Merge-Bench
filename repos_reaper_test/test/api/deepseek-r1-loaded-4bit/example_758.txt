Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The conflicting part is the value of JVM_STARTUP_WAIT_TIME_MS. The HEAD version has 5_000, and the other branch has 2_000.

First, I need to understand why each branch changed this value. Maybe in one branch, they found that 5 seconds was necessary for the test to wait, while the other reduced it to 2 seconds thinking it's sufficient. Without more context, it's hard to tell which is correct. 

Since the user asked to resolve based on intent and semantics, I should consider if there's a way to satisfy both. But these are conflicting numerical values. Unless there's a way both changes can coexist, which they can't here. 

If I can't determine the correct value, the safest approach is to leave the conflict as is. But maybe one of the values is more recent or correct. If the user's current branch (HEAD) uses 5_000, perhaps that's an update from an older 2_000. Or maybe the other way around. 

Since the user hasn't provided additional context, I can't be sure. The best practice here is to not guess and leave the conflict unresolved, prompting the user to decide. However, the instructions say if unsure, return the same snippet with the conflict. So I should present the conflict as is.</think>
