Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let's look at what's going on here. The conflict is between the HEAD version and the other branch. In the HEAD, the line is declaring a BitmapTexture variable called mBitmapTexture. In the other branch, it's a BitmapTextureAtlas variable named mBitmapTextureAtlas. 

Hmm, both sides are introducing different types for what might be similar purposes. The surrounding context shows that there's a TextureRegion variable mFaceTextureRegion, and later a SparseArray of Sprites. I should consider the intent here. BitmapTexture and BitmapTextureAtlas are likely related but different classes. Maybe one branch updated the code to use a texture atlas for better performance, while the other was using a simple bitmap texture.

If the project has moved towards using texture atlases, then the correct variable would be BitmapTextureAtlas. But I need to check if both changes are compatible. Are these two changes conflicting because they're renaming the variable and changing the type, or are they separate changes that can coexist? 

Looking at the code, the conflict is in the declaration. The variables have different names and types. If one branch replaces BitmapTexture with BitmapTextureAtlas, then keeping the latter makes sense. However, if both variables are needed for different purposes, that's a problem. But given that they're in the same place, it's more likely a rename or refactor. 

Since the code after the conflict uses mFaceTextureRegion, which is a TextureRegion, and BitmapTextureAtlas is often used in conjunction with TextureRegions (as the atlas holds multiple textures), the correct resolution might be to accept the BitmapTextureAtlas change from the incoming branch. Therefore, the conflict should be resolved by choosing the BitmapTextureAtlas declaration and removing the HEAD version. That way, the code uses the atlas, which is more efficient if managing multiple textures.</think>
```java
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private int mFaceIDCounter;
	private final SparseArray<Sprite> mFaces = new SparseArray<Sprite>();
