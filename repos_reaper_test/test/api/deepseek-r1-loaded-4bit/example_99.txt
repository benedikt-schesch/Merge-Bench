<think>
Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the method declaration of `isEqualTo(byte expected)`. The HEAD version has the opening curly brace on the same line as the method signature without a space before it, while the other branch has a space before the curly brace.

Hmm, in Java coding conventions, it's common to put the opening curly brace on the same line as the method declaration, but with a space before it. So the version from the other branch adds that space, which aligns with standard style. The HEAD version is missing the space. 

Since the difference is purely stylistic—spacing around the curly brace—the intent of both branches is the same. They both want to implement the `isEqualTo` method. The semantic meaning of the code isn't changing here; it's just a formatting difference. 

Therefore, resolving this conflict by choosing the version with the space before the curly brace would be appropriate. That way, the code follows conventional Java style. There's no ambiguity in the intent, so the conflict can be resolved by taking the version from the other branch. 

I need to make sure to remove the conflict markers and keep the correct line. The rest of the context remains unchanged. The empty line after the method in the HEAD doesn't affect functionality, but since the other branch doesn't have it, maybe it's an extra line that was added. Wait, looking at the original snippet, after the HEAD's method, there's an empty line, but the other branch's method doesn't have that. Wait, the original code shows after the HEAD's `isEqualTo` method, there's an empty line, and then the closing ```. The other branch doesn't have that empty line. So the conflict is between the method's curly brace style and the presence of an empty line after.

Wait, let me check again. The original code snippet shows:

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected){
=======
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD


=======
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7

So after the method, the HEAD has two empty lines, and the other branch has none. Wait, no: in the original, after the method's closing }, the HEAD has an empty line (as seen by the line after "return this; }" followed by a blank line before the closing ```), and the other branch doesn't. But in the provided code, the conflict markers are only around the method declaration. Wait, the user's code snippet shows:

The method is declared with conflict markers around the method signature. Then, after the method body, there's another conflict marker from HEAD with an empty line. Wait, looking at the original code:

Here's the snippet:

  protected ByteAssert(Byte actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ByteAssert.class, description);
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected){
=======
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD


```

So after the method, the HEAD version has an empty line (or two?), and the other branch doesn't. Wait, the original code shows after the method, there's a line with "<<<<<<< HEAD", then a blank line, then "=======", then ">>>>>>> ...". Wait, no. Let me parse this correctly.

The code as given has:

The method is in conflict between HEAD and the other branch. Then, after the method's closing }, there's another conflict marker from HEAD, which includes a blank line, and the other side has nothing. So the second conflict is about the blank line after the method.

So the user's code has two separate conflicts: one in the method declaration, and another in the lines after the method. Wait, no. Looking again:

The code snippet is:

  protected ByteAssert(Byte actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ByteAssert.class, description);
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected){
=======
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD


```

Wait, the last part shows "<<<<<<< HEAD" followed by two empty lines, and then the end of the code snippet. But where is the corresponding "=======" and ">>>>>>>" for that second conflict? Because in the original code, the second conflict marker is not closed. That might be a mistake in the user's input. Let me check the original code again.

The user provided:

```java

  protected ByteAssert(Byte actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ByteAssert.class, description);
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected){
=======
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD


```

So after the method, there's a line with "<<<<<<< HEAD" followed by two empty lines, but no matching "=======" or ">>>>>>>". That's probably a typo or incomplete conflict marker. But according to the user's input, that's how the snippet is. However, merge conflicts require both markers. So perhaps the user made a mistake here. But given that, how should we handle it?

Assuming that the second conflict is an error, perhaps the user intended only the method declaration conflict. Alternatively, maybe the second conflict is about an empty line after the method. But in any case, the user's instruction is to resolve the conflict in the given snippet.

In the original code, after the method, there's a line with "<<<<<<< HEAD" and then two empty lines, but no closing marker. That's an invalid conflict. Therefore, this part is not a valid merge conflict. So perhaps the user intended only the method declaration conflict, and the rest is an error. However, given the input, the assistant must work with what's provided.

But the original code shows that after the method, there's another conflict marker from HEAD but no resolution. So perhaps the user's code has two conflicts: one in the method signature, and another after the method. But the second conflict is incomplete. That's probably a mistake. However, the user's instruction is to return the entire snippet with conflict resolved if possible.

In the given code, the main conflict is in the method signature. The other part after the method is just a HEAD marker with some lines. Since there's no corresponding "=======" or ">>>>>>>", that's not a valid conflict. Therefore, perhaps that's a typo. But the user included it as part of the snippet. So in the output, we need to preserve the context as much as possible.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Return the entire snippet (including full context) in markdown code syntax as provided, make sure you do not modify the context at all and preserve the spacing as is." Except for resolving the conflict. So if there's an incomplete conflict marker after the method, but the user hasn't provided the other side, then that part is not a conflict. But according to the user's input, the code has:

After the method, there's:

<<<<<<< HEAD


```

So in the original code, after the method, there's the line "<<<<<<< HEAD" followed by two empty lines and then the end of the snippet. This is an invalid conflict because it's missing the "=======" and ">>>>>>>" parts. Therefore, perhaps it's a mistake. However, according to the user's input, this is part of the snippet, so we must include it as is unless we are resolving it.

But since the user's problem is to resolve the merge conflict, and the second part isn't a valid conflict, we can ignore it. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the second conflict to be part of the same conflict. But no, the first conflict is around the method declaration, and the second part is after the method's closing brace.

Wait, let me re-examine the code structure.

Original code:

  protected ByteAssert(...) { ... }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected){
=======
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    ... 
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD


```

So after the method's closing }, there's a line with "<<<<<<< HEAD" followed by two empty lines. But there's no matching "=======" or ">>>>>>>", which is invalid. So perhaps that's a mistake in the user's example. But the user might have intended that as part of the conflict.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's code had a merge conflict in the method declaration, and then another merge conflict after the method. But without the corresponding markers, it's unclear.

Given the ambiguity, the safest approach is to resolve the valid conflict (the method signature) and leave the rest as is, including the invalid "<<<<<<< HEAD" line and the empty lines, because the user instructed to "preserve the spacing as is" except for resolving the conflict.

But wait, the user says: "If you are not sure on how to resolve the conflict or if the intent is ambiguous, please return the same snippet with the conflict." So for the method signature, the conflict is clear and can be resolved. For the part after the method, since it's an incomplete conflict marker, it's ambiguous. Therefore, we should leave that part as a conflict.

But looking at the original code, after the method, there's:

<<<<<<< HEAD


```

Which is the HEAD side, but no other side. So that's an invalid conflict. Therefore, the user's code has an error here. However, the user's instruction is to return the entire snippet with resolved conflicts if possible, otherwise leave the conflicts.

In this case, the first conflict (method signature) can be resolved by choosing the version with the space before the curly brace. The second part, with "<<<<<<< HEAD" and two empty lines, is an unresolved conflict because there's no corresponding other side. Therefore, we must leave that as a conflict.

But in the user's code, after resolving the first conflict, what's next? The code would be:

  protected ByteAssert(Byte actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ByteAssert.class, description);
  }

  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD


```

So the line "<<<<<<< HEAD" followed by two empty lines is still present. That's a conflict marker without resolution, so it's an unresolved conflict. Therefore, the user's code has two conflicts: the method signature (which can be resolved) and this line (which is invalid and cannot be resolved because there's no other side).

But according to the user's problem statement, the code snippet includes a merge conflict. Perhaps the user intended only the method signature conflict, and the rest is a mistake. However, the assistant must follow the instructions. Since the second conflict is invalid, and the user's instruction says to return the entire snippet with conflict resolved if possible, otherwise leave the conflict. Since the second part is not a valid conflict, the assistant should leave it as is, but the user's instruction says to return the entire snippet with conflict markers only if the intent is ambiguous.

But in this case, the second part is not a conflict, it's just a leftover HEAD marker. So perhaps the user made a typo. However, the assistant must process the input as given.

But according to the problem statement, the user provided the code snippet with merge conflicts. So if there's an unmatched <<<<<<< HEAD, that's part of the code, but not a valid conflict. Therefore, the assistant should not modify it and leave it as is.

But the user's instruction says to return the entire snippet, including full context as provided, preserving spacing. So the assistant should only resolve the valid conflicts and leave the rest, including any invalid markers.

Therefore, in the resolved code, the method signature is merged to use the version with the space, and the line "<<<<<<< HEAD" followed by two empty lines remains as is because it's not a valid conflict. But wait, according to the user's code, after the method, the code has:

<<<<<<< HEAD


```

So that's part of the original code. However, since there's no closing marker, it's not a conflict. Therefore, the assistant should leave it as is, as per the instruction to preserve context. However, the user might have intended that as part of the conflict. But given the input, the assistant can't resolve that part. Therefore, the final code would have the method resolved and the rest left with the <<<<<<< HEAD line and empty lines, which is part of the original code.

But that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user's code had a merge conflict that includes the empty lines. Let me look again.

Wait, the original code after the method is:

<<<<<<< HEAD


```

So the HEAD version has two empty lines after the method, and the other branch has nothing. But the way merge conflicts work is that the structure is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
content from HEAD
=======
content from other branch
>>>>>>> ...

In this case, the code after the method has only the HEAD part, without the other branch's content. Therefore, it's an incomplete conflict. But the user's code includes that as part of the snippet. Therefore, the assistant must leave it as is, since it's not a valid conflict and can't be resolved. 

But according to the user's instruction, if the intent is ambiguous or not sure, leave the conflict. In this case, the assistant can't resolve the second part, so the conflict remains. However, the user's example shows that the code has only one valid conflict (the method signature) and an invalid one after. So the assistant should resolve the method signature conflict and leave the rest as is, including the invalid markers. But the user's instruction says to return the entire snippet, including full context, without modifying the context except resolving conflicts.

Therefore, the final answer should resolve the method signature conflict by taking the version with the space, and leave the rest of the code as is, including the "<<<<<<< HEAD" line and the empty lines. However, that line is not part of a valid conflict, so it's actually a leftover conflict marker. But according to the user's input, that's how the code is, so the assistant should include it.

But wait, the user's original code snippet ends with "<<<<<<< HEAD" followed by two empty lines and then the closing ```. So in the resolved code, after merging the method, the assistant must include that line as part of the context. But since it's not a conflict, perhaps the user made a mistake, but the assistant must preserve it.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the entire code after the method is part of the same conflict. But that's not possible because the method's conflict is already closed with the >>>>>>> marker. So the part after is a separate conflict, but it's incomplete.

In this case, the assistant can only resolve the first conflict (method signature) and leave the rest as is, including the invalid conflict marker. However, the user's instruction says to return the entire snippet with conflict resolved if possible. Since the second part is an invalid conflict, it can't be resolved, so it remains as is.

But according to the user's problem statement, the code has a merge conflict, which is the method signature. The rest is probably a mistake. But the user's example includes it, so the assistant must include it.

Therefore, the final resolved code would have the method signature merged with the space, and the rest of the code as is, including the "<<<<<<< HEAD" line and empty lines. But the user's instruction says to return the entire snippet in markdown code syntax as provided, preserving spacing. So the assistant must include that.

Wait, but the user's code after the method is:

<<<<<<< HEAD


```

So after resolving the method conflict, the code would have:

  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD


```

But that line is not part of any conflict, it's just leftover text. Therefore, the correct approach is to resolve the method conflict and leave the rest as is, including the invalid markers. However, the user's instruction says to return the entire snippet including context, so the assistant must include it.

But according to the user's instructions, if the assistant is not sure, leave the conflict. In this case, the method conflict is resolvable, but the part after is not a conflict. Therefore, the assistant should resolve the method conflict and leave the rest as is. However, the line "<<<<<<< HEAD" is a conflict marker, but without the other parts, it's not a valid conflict. Therefore, it's an error in the original code. The assistant should include it as is, since the instruction is to preserve the context.

Therefore, the final resolved code will have the method signature from the other branch (with the space) and the rest of the code, including the invalid conflict marker, preserved as is.

But wait, the user's original code after the method is:

<<<<<<< HEAD


```

So in the original code, after resolving the method conflict, the remaining part is just that line and the empty lines. Since it's not a conflict, the assistant must leave it as is. However, that line is a conflict marker, which is part of the original code. Therefore, the assistant must include it as part of the output.

But that's part of the merge conflict. Wait, perhaps the user intended that the entire block from the method declaration to the end is part of a larger conflict. But that doesn't make sense because the method's conflict is properly closed with the >>>>>>> marker. So the line after is a separate conflict, but it's not properly formed.

In conclusion, the assistant should resolve the method signature conflict by selecting the version with the space, and leave the rest of the code as is, including the invalid <<<<<<< HEAD line. But that line is part of the original code, so according to the user's instruction to preserve context, it must be included.</think>
