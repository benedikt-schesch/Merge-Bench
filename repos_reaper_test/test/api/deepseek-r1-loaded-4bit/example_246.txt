Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in a Java method declaration. The HEAD version has the method signature with "throws IOException" on the same line as the method parameters, while the other branch (1cb2531) has the same line but with a line break and indentation before "throws IOException".

The goal here is to resolve the conflict without changing the functionality. The only difference is formatting. Both versions are valid Java, but the indentation style differs. Since the rest of the code is the same, the conflict is purely stylistic.

In such cases, it's best to choose one style. Since the other branch's version adds indentation, which might align with the project's coding standards for line wrapping, that might be preferable. Alternatively, if the project's existing code uses the HEAD style, that should be kept. But without more context, it's safer to assume that the indented version is intentional, perhaps to adhere to line length limits or style guides.

So, the resolved code should take the version from the second branch (1cb2531) because it maintains the method's functionality and adjusts the formatting for better readability. The rest of the context remains unchanged. Therefore, the conflict markers are removed, and the indented line is kept.</think>
