<think>
Okay, let me take a look at this merge conflict. The code in question is a test method in Java. The conflict is between the HEAD version and the commit a17acec. 

In the HEAD version, after creating a Connection with invalid JSON, there's a call to failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown. This is probably using a testing framework like JUnit or something similar, where if the expected exception isn't thrown, the test should fail. The line is there to ensure that the test only passes if the exception is actually thrown.

On the other side, the other commit removes that line. Maybe they thought that the @Test(expected = ...) annotation is sufficient, and adding the failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown is redundant. Because in JUnit, if you specify the expected exception in the annotation, the test will automatically fail if that exception isn't thrown. So adding the fail line might be unnecessary and could even cause a problem if the test framework already handles it.

So the conflict arises because one side added an explicit check, and the other removed it. The key here is understanding if the explicit fail is needed. Since the @Test annotation already specifies the expected exception, the fail line is redundant. Therefore, removing it would be the correct resolution because the annotation alone suffices. The line from HEAD is not needed, so the merge should take the version without it. Hence, the resolved code should omit the failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown line.</think>

  @Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)
  public void checkInvalidJson() {
    new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST), "{", User.class);
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_reachAllElements() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();
