Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The code is in Java, and there's a conflict between the HEAD version and another commit. 

Looking at the conflict area: in the HEAD, there are two lines setting this.family and this.qualifiers. The other side (482c393) seems to have removed those lines, leaving just an empty line before this.lockid.

The surrounding code before the conflict is in an else block where they set this.qualifiers to DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER. Then, in HEAD, after that else block, they set family and qualifiers again. But the other side removes those lines. 

Wait, maybe the problem is that the code in HEAD is conflicting with the else block. Let me think about the intent here. The else block is handling the case where there's no specific qualifier to delete, so they delete the entire family. Then, in HEAD, after that, they set this.family and this.qualifiers again. But if the else block already set qualifiers to DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER, setting them again might overwrite that. 

The other side (the conflicting commit) removes those lines. So perhaps those lines in HEAD were added by mistake, and the correct code is to not have them, allowing the else block's logic to take effect. Or maybe the lines in HEAD are necessary for some other case. 

Looking at the code structure, the lines in HEAD are outside the else block. So regardless of whether the else block is executed, those lines would run. But that might be a problem because if the else block set qualifiers to DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER, then the subsequent line in HEAD would overwrite it. For example, if qualifiers is null, then this.qualifiers would be set to DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER again. But maybe that's redundant or incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the lines in HEAD were part of a constructor or method that initializes family and qualifiers, but the else block is part of a conditional that modifies qualifiers. If those lines are supposed to set the instance variables based on parameters, then perhaps they should be there. But if they're conflicting with the else block, maybe they should be removed.

Wait, let's look at the code flow. The else block is part of an if-else. So if the else is executed (no qualifier to delete), then this.qualifiers is set to DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER. Then, regardless of that, in HEAD, the code sets this.family = family and this.qualifiers based on whether qualifiers is null. That would override whatever was set in the else block. That's probably incorrect because the else block's logic would be undone.

So the correct approach would be to remove those lines from HEAD, as the other commit does. Because otherwise, the else block's assignment to qualifiers is immediately overwritten. Therefore, the correct resolution is to accept the version that removes those lines, thus keeping the else block's changes intact.

Therefore, the resolved code should not include the two lines from HEAD. So the merge conflict should be resolved by taking the version from the other commit (482c393), which removes those lines. That way, after the else block, the family and qualifiers are not reset, preserving the intended behavior of deleting the family when necessary.</think>
```java
    } else {
      // No specific qualifier to delete: delete the entire family.  Not that
      // if `family == null', we'll delete and setting this is harmless.
      this.qualifiers = DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER;
    }

    this.lockid = lockid;
  }

  @Override
  public byte[] table() {

```
