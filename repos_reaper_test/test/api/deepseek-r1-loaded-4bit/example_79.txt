<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The code shows a conflict in the `Localizable` interface's method declaration. On the HEAD side, the method is declared as `public String getString();`, while the other branch has `String getString();`. 

In Java, interface methods are implicitly public and abstract. So specifying `public` is redundant. The version from the branch that omits `public` is actually correct and follows standard Java conventions. The HEAD side might have added the `public` modifier explicitly, but it's unnecessary. The two changes are semantically the same because the method in an interface is public by default. 

Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the version without the `public` modifier since it's more concise and adheres to Java best practices. There's no functional difference here, just a stylistic one. So I'll remove the conflict markers and use the branch's version.</think>
```java
   */
  public interface Localizable {
    /**
     * @return The user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     */
    String getString();
  }

  /**
   * Enums that implement this interface have two user-visible strings associated with them.
   * <p>

```
