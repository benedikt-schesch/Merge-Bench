Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The HEAD version has the DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN constant, along with mStackMargin initialized to that. The other branch (from commit 4f63cd1) adds mEnableRotation and mGravity. Both sides are adding different fields. Since these are separate variables without overlapping, I can combine them. So the resolved code should include all the fields from both branches. Let me check the order. The HEAD has the constant first, then mStackMargin. The other branch's fields come after the constant but before mColor. So merging them would place mEnableRotation and mGravity after mStackMargin. Wait, in the conflict, the HEAD's section ends with mStackMargin, and the other branch's section starts with the two new variables. Since they are in the same region, merging them would require placing all variables from both sides. So the correct merge is to include DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN, mStackMargin, mEnableRotation, mGravity, then the rest. That way, both changes are incorporated without conflict. No ambiguity here because the variables don't interfere. So the resolved code should have all four variables in order.</think>
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;


public class CardStack extends RelativeLayout {

    public static final int DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN = 20;

    private int mStackMargin = DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN;
    private boolean mEnableRotation;
    private int mGravity;
    private int mColor = -1;
    private int mIndex = 0;
    private int mNumVisible = 4;
    private boolean canSwipe = true;
    private ArrayAdapter<?> mAdapter;
