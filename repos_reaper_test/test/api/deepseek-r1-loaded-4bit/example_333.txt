Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The user provided a Java code snippet with a conflict in the import statements. The HEAD version imports TwitterDbAdapter, while the other branch adds several other imports: StatusTable, Followable, HasFavorite, Retrievable. 

First, I need to understand the intent behind both changes. The HEAD branch might have been refactoring or moving the TwitterDbAdapter class, while the other branch is introducing new interfaces or classes related to tasks. Since these are different imports, they might not conflict in functionality. 

The key here is to check if these imports are necessary. Both sides are adding different classes, so combining them makes sense. The conflict markers can be removed, and all the imports from both branches should be included. There's no overlap in the classes being imported, so it's safe to merge both sets.

I should make sure that the order of imports is correct. Typically, Java imports are grouped, but since the original code doesn't show a specific order, keeping the existing structure as per both branches should be okay. So the resolved code will have all the imports from both sides without the conflict markers.</think>
```java
import android.database.Cursor;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.view.Menu;

import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.Tweet;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.db.TwitterDbAdapter;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.db.StatusTablesInfo.StatusTable;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.task.Followable;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.task.HasFavorite;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.task.Retrievable;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.ui.base.TwitterCursorBaseActivity;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.weibo.Paging;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.weibo.Status;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.weibo.WeiboException;
```

The resolution combines both sets of imports since:
1. `TwitterDbAdapter` from HEAD and `StatusTable` from branch are both database-related components
2. The task interfaces (`Followable`, `HasFavorite`, `Retrievable`) from the branch appear to be new functionality additions
3. There's no actual conflict between these imports - they represent complementary functionality
4. All imports are needed for different aspects of the class's responsibilities (database access, task interfaces, base activity)
