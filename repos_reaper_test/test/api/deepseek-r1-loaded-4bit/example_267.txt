Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java method createDataBag. Both sides are trying to set the bagType variable based on a configuration value. The HEAD version has the line indented with more spaces, while the other branch (88ae4a5) has it with fewer. 

Hmm, the code is checking if PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get() is not null, then retrieves a property. The only difference here is the indentation level. In Java, indentation doesn't affect the code's functionality; it's just for readability. So the semantic intent of both changes is the sameâ€”they both want to get the "pig.cachedbag.type" from the configuration.

Since the conflict is purely about whitespace, I should resolve it by choosing one of the indentation styles. But looking at the surrounding code, the method uses 4 spaces for indentation. The HEAD version has an extra indentation, making it 8 spaces, while the other branch uses 4 spaces. Wait, let me check the context.

The surrounding lines: the if block is indented with 4 spaces. The HEAD version has the line inside the if block indented with 8 spaces, which is inconsistent. The other branch uses 4 spaces, which aligns with the if statement's indentation. So the correct indentation should be 4 spaces inside the if block. Therefore, the version from the other branch (88ae4a5) has the correct indentation. The conflict is due to a formatting difference, and the correct resolution is to use the properly indented line.</think>
```java
    }

    private DataBag createDataBag(int numBags) {
        String bagType = null;
        if (PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get() != null) {
            bagType = PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get().get("pig.cachedbag.type");
        }

        if (bagType != null && bagType.equalsIgnoreCase("default")) {
            return new NonSpillableDataBag();
        }
        return new InternalCachedBag(numBags);
