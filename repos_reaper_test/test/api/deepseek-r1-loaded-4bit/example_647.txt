Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict in the imports section of a Java file. On the HEAD side, there's an import for JsonMapper, and on the other branch (a17acec), they're adding a static import for JsonObject.getNames.

First, I need to understand why this conflict happened. The HEAD version has certain static imports, and the other branch is adding another one. Since both changes are in the same region—the import statements—Git couldn't automatically merge them, leading to a conflict.

The goal is to resolve this without altering the context unnecessarily. In Java, import statements can be organized, but as long as they don't conflict in terms of what's being imported, they can coexist. Here, the HEAD doesn't have the import for getNames, while the other branch adds it. So semantically, both imports are needed: the existing ones from HEAD and the new one from the other branch.

I should check if the order matters. Java doesn't care about the order of imports, but it's common to group static imports separately. The existing code has static imports first, then regular imports. The new import is a static import, so it should go with the other static imports.

Looking at the original code, the HEAD has:

import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromLongFormat;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;

And the other branch adds:

import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames;

So the correct resolution would be to include all three static imports. The conflict arises because the two branches modified the same part of the file (the static imports section). Therefore, the resolved code should combine both changes by adding the new static import from the a17acec branch into the HEAD's imports.

I need to make sure that the spacing and order are preserved as much as possible. The original has the static imports first, then the regular import. So inserting the new static import after the existing ones or before shouldn't matter, but perhaps the order in the branches can guide this. The a17acec branch adds the import at the top of the static imports, but the HEAD doesn't have it. However, since the user says to preserve spacing as is, maybe the correct approach is to place the new import where it was in the a17acec branch, but merged with the HEAD's existing imports.

Wait, looking at the conflict markers:

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

So in the HEAD, the lines between <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= are what's current. In this case, the HEAD has no line for getNames, and the other branch adds it. So the conflict is between the HEAD's imports (without getNames) and the other branch's addition of getNames.

Therefore, to resolve, we should include the getNames import from the other branch into the HEAD's code. Since the static imports are already present, adding the new one would be correct. So the resolved code should have all three static imports: getNames, toDateFromLongFormat, and unmodifiableList.

So the merged imports would be:

import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames;
import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromLongFormat;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;

But wait, in the original conflict, the a17acec branch adds the getNames import before the existing ones? Let me check the original code again.

The original snippet shows:

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromLongFormat;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;

So in the conflicting code, the a17acec branch adds the getNames import line above the existing two static imports. The HEAD doesn't have that line. So when merging, the getNames import should be added. Therefore, the correct resolution is to include the getNames import line from the a17acec branch, followed by the two existing static imports from HEAD.

But wait, in the code structure, the a17acec's addition is between the <<<<<<< and >>>>>>> markers. The HEAD part is empty in that section, meaning that the HEAD doesn't have the getNames import, and the a17acec adds it. So the merged result should include the getNames import line, followed by the existing imports from HEAD.

Therefore, the resolved code would have all three static imports in the order they appear when combining both changes. The a17acec adds the getNames import before the other static imports. But in the HEAD, those other imports are already present. Wait, no—the conflict is in the middle of the imports. Let me look again.

The code as presented is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromLongFormat;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;

So in the current state, the HEAD does not have the line import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames; (because between <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= there's nothing), and the a17acec branch adds that line. Then, after the >>>>>>> marker, the existing lines from HEAD are the two static imports.

Wait, no. The way merge conflicts work is that the code between <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= is what's in the current branch (HEAD), and the code between ======= and >>>>>>> is what's in the other branch.

But in the provided code, the HEAD section (between <<<<<<< HEAD and =======) is empty. Then the other branch adds the getNames import. Then after the >>>>>>>, the rest of the code is from HEAD, which includes the two static imports and the regular import.

So the conflict is that the other branch added an import line (getNames) right before the existing imports in HEAD. So when merging, the correct resolution would be to include the getNames import from the other branch, followed by the existing imports from HEAD.

Therefore, the resolved code should have:

import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames;
import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromLongFormat;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;

import com.restfb.Facebook;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper;

That way, the new import from the other branch is added before the existing ones. The order of static imports isn't semantically important in Java, so this should be acceptable. Also, the user specified to preserve spacing as is. In the original code from the other branch, the getNames import is placed above the existing static imports. So combining them would result in adding that line there.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to include the getNames import from the a17acec branch, followed by the existing static imports from HEAD. This resolves the conflict without altering other parts of the code.</think>
