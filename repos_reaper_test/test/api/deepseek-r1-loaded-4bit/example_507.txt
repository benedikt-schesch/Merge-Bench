Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict. Let me look at the code snippet. The conflict is between HEAD and the other branch. Both sides are creating a SpriteBatch object, but they're using different parameters. The HEAD version uses this.mBitmapTexture, while the other branch uses this.mBitmapTextureAtlas.

Hmm, the question is, which one is correct? Are these two parameters referring to the same thing but renamed, or are they different? Since the variable names are similar, maybe mBitmapTexture was renamed to mBitmapTextureAtlas in one branch. That's a common scenario. If that's the case, the correct parameter would be mBitmapTextureAtlas, as the other branch has the updated name.

Looking at the surrounding code, there's no other context that suggests a different approach. Both sides want to create a SpriteBatch with a texture or texture atlas and a value of 2. The method onDrawSpriteBatch is the same in both, so the conflict is purely about the parameter.

Assuming that mBitmapTextureAtlas is the correct and updated variable name, the resolution would be to use that. So I should keep the version from the conflicting branch (91801fdd...) and remove the HEAD version. That way, the correct variable is used, and the conflict is resolved.</think>
```java
		
		faceSprite1.setScale(2);
		faceSprite2.setRotation(45);

		/* Create the face and add it to the scene. */
		final SpriteBatch dynamicSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, 2) {
			@Override
			public void onDrawSpriteBatch() {
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
				this.draw(faceSprite2);
			}
``` 

Rationale: The conflict appears to be about a parameter name change from `mBitmapTexture` to `mBitmapTextureAtlas`. Since texture atlases are a common concept in graphics programming (collections of textures), and assuming this is a refactor/rename rather than conflicting implementations, I've kept the `mBitmapTextureAtlas` version as it's likely a more specific/accurate name. Both versions agree on the SpriteBatch creation pattern and drawing logic.
