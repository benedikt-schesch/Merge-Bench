<think>
Okay, let's see what the problem is here. The user provided a Java code snippet with a merge conflict. The conflict is between the HEAD version and another commit (1488b22ce3...). The conflicting lines are both declaring a transient final Log variable, but the only difference seems to be the whitespace at the end of the line. In the HEAD version, there's a space before the semicolon, and in the other branch, there's no space. 

Hmm, so the actual code change here is just a trailing space. That's a minor formatting difference, not a semantic one. Both sides are trying to declare the same variable with the same initialization. The intent from both branches is identical; it's just a matter of code style or perhaps an accidental extra space.

Since the conflict is purely about whitespace, the correct resolution would be to pick one of the versions. But which one? Well, in Java, trailing spaces in lines aren't significant, so either version is functionally the same. However, to resolve the conflict, I should choose the version without the trailing space because it's cleaner and follows common coding conventions that avoid trailing whitespace.

The rest of the code around the conflict is the same, so I don't need to touch anything else. The key is to ensure that the resolved line doesn't have the extra space. Therefore, the correct merge would be to take the version from the branch that's not HEAD, which is the one without the trailing space. So the resolved line should be:

private transient final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());

And remove the conflict markers. Also, I need to make sure that the rest of the context remains unchanged as per the user's instructions. The user emphasized not modifying the context and preserving spacing except for resolving the conflict. Since the conflict is only about that line, the rest stays the same.</think>
