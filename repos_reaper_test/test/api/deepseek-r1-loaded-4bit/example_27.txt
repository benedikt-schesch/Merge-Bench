Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The HEAD version adds an import for GenericMath from org.spout.math, while the other side (cc07030) removes it. The conflict is in the imports section.

I need to figure out if GenericMath is actually needed. The surrounding context shows other imports related to math and physics. The file is defining a Block's characteristics, so maybe GenericMath was used for some calculations here. But if the other side removed it, perhaps it's no longer necessary or was moved elsewhere.

Wait, the other branch just has an empty line where the import was. Maybe someone cleaned up unused imports, and GenericMath isn't used anymore. Or maybe there was a merge mistake. Let me check the code after the imports. The class is a Block definition, using ReactDefaults, CollisionShape, etc. If there's no usage of GenericMath in the code, then removing it is safe. But if the HEAD version added it for a reason, like a new calculation, then keeping it would be necessary.

Looking at the code after the conflict, the imports after are ReactDefaults and CollisionShape. The class comment doesn't show any obvious use of GenericMath. Maybe the import was added by accident in HEAD, or the other branch correctly removed it because it's unused. Alternatively, maybe the other branch's change was just adding a newline, but that's less likely.

Since the conflict is about the presence of the import, and without seeing the rest of the code where GenericMath is used, it's a bit ambiguous. But as a resolver, if both sides don't have other changes, maybe the correct resolution is to remove the import, assuming it's no longer needed. So, take the version from cc07030, which removes the import line. Therefore, the resolved code would not include the GenericMath import.</think>
