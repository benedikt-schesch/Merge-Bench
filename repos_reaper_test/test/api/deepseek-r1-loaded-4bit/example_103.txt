Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The code in question is a Java method for a ShortAssert class. The conflict is between the HEAD version and another branch's version of the isEqualTo method.

Looking at the two versions, the only difference I see is the spacing in the method declaration. The HEAD version has "isEqualTo(short expected){" with the opening brace on the same line, while the other branch adds a space before the brace: "isEqualTo(short expected) {". 

Since the rest of the code is identical, this seems like a style difference. Some coding styles prefer no space before the opening brace, while others do. But in terms of semantics, both versions are functionally the same. The intent of both branches is to implement the isEqualTo method correctly. 

Since there's no actual conflict in logic or functionality, the correct resolution would be to choose one of the styles. However, the user instructed to consider the intent and semantics. Both changes are about code formatting, not the actual behavior. 

The user also said if unsure or if the intent is ambiguous, leave the conflict. But in this case, the conflict is purely stylistic. Since the merge conflict is about whitespace, and both versions are correct, perhaps the resolver should pick one. But since the user hasn't specified a style guide, maybe the best approach is to pick the version with the space, as it's a common Java convention to have a space before the opening brace. Alternatively, perhaps the branch version is correcting the style. 

But the user's instruction says to preserve the context if unsure. Wait, the user said if not sure or intent is ambiguous, return the same snippet with conflict. But here, the intent is the same; it's just formatting. So maybe the correct resolution is to pick either version, as they are semantically equivalent. But since the user wants the conflict resolved, I should merge them by choosing one. 

But the original problem says to return the resolved code if possible. Since the only difference is a space before the brace, and that's a style choice, but the conflict is trivial. So the resolved code would have the method declaration with the space, as in the branch version. Because the branch version added the space, maybe that's the intended correction. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by taking the branch's version.</think>
```java

  protected ShortAssert(Short actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ShortAssert.class, description);
  }

  public ShortAssert isEqualTo(short expected) {
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
