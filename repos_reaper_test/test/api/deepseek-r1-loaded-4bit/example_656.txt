Okay, let's see. The user provided a Java code snippet with a merge conflict. The task is to resolve the conflict by understanding the intent of both sides. The conflict is between `dataItem` and `dataList`. 

First, I need to look at the surrounding code. The lines in question are setting `this.data` to an unmodifiable list. The HEAD version uses `dataItem`, while the other branch uses `dataList`. 

I should check if there's any other context that might indicate which variable is correct. The variables `dataItem` and `dataList` might have been declared elsewhere. If both branches are trying to achieve the same thing but with different variable names, it's a naming conflict. 

Since the user mentioned semantic merge resolution, I need to determine which variable name makes sense in the context. If, for example, the rest of the code uses `dataList` to refer to the collection, then the correct choice would be `dataList`. Alternatively, if `dataItem` is a list that's being constructed, maybe that's the right one.

However, without additional context, it's hard to be certain. But in Java, it's common to name a list variable with a plural, like `dataList`. If the other branch changed the variable name from `dataItem` to `dataList` for consistency, that might be the intended change. 

Since the conflict is just a variable name change, and assuming both sides intend to set `this.data` to an unmodifiable version of the list, the correct resolution would be to pick the most appropriate variable name. If the incoming change (a17acec) is introducing a more accurate name, then `dataList` should be used. 

But if I'm not sure, I should leave the conflict as is. However, the user asked to resolve if possible. Given that variable renames are common and assuming the branch is correcting the name, I'll go with `dataList`.</think>
```java
      totalCount = jsonSummary.get("total_count") != null ? jsonSummary.getLong("total_count", 0L) : null;
    } else {
      totalCount = null;
    }

    this.data = unmodifiableList(dataList);
    this.facebookClient = facebookClient;
    this.connectionType = connectionType;
  }
