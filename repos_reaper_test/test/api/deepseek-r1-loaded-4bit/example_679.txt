Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. So, looking at the code snippet, the conflict is in the imports section of a Java file. The HEAD version has an import for EnableFacebook from Spring Social's Facebook config, while the other branch (3ce669e) adds several other imports related to Facebook, like ReconnectFilter, Facebook, FacebookTemplate, FacebookConnectionFactory, and also includes the existing DisconnectController.

First, I need to understand what each side is doing. The HEAD adds EnableFacebook, which is probably an annotation used to enable Facebook integration in the application. The other branch adds more Facebook-related classes, possibly for connecting and interacting with Facebook's API, like the FacebookConnectionFactory and FacebookTemplate. They also add ReconnectFilter, which might handle reconnecting users.

The goal here is to merge both sets of imports without duplication. Since EnableFacebook is an annotation that might be necessary for configuration, and the other imports are specific classes needed for functionality, they should all be included. There's no overlap except that both are related to Facebook, but they serve different purposes. The DisconnectController import is present in both versions, so it should stay once.

So, the correct resolution would be to keep all the imports from both branches. That means including EnableFacebook from HEAD and the Facebook API classes from the other branch. Also, ReconnectFilter is a new addition that's not in HEAD, so it should stay. There's no conflict between these imports; they just add different necessary classes. Therefore, merging them by including all the imports should resolve the conflict without issues.</think>
```java
import org.springframework.social.connect.ConnectionFactoryLocator;
import org.springframework.social.connect.ConnectionRepository;
import org.springframework.social.connect.UsersConnectionRepository;
import org.springframework.social.connect.web.ConnectController;
import org.springframework.social.connect.web.ProviderSignInController;
import org.springframework.social.connect.web.ReconnectFilter;
import org.springframework.social.facebook.api.Facebook;
import org.springframework.social.facebook.api.impl.FacebookTemplate;
import org.springframework.social.facebook.config.annotation.EnableFacebook;
import org.springframework.social.facebook.connect.FacebookConnectionFactory;
import org.springframework.social.facebook.web.DisconnectController;
import org.springframework.social.linkedin.config.annotation.EnableLinkedIn;
import org.springframework.social.showcase.facebook.PostToWallAfterConnectInterceptor;
import org.springframework.social.showcase.signin.SimpleSignInAdapter;
import org.springframework.social.showcase.twitter.TweetAfterConnectInterceptor;
```

The resolution maintains all necessary imports from both branches:
1. Keeps `@EnableFacebook` annotation from HEAD for configuration
2. Preserves Facebook API components (Facebook, FacebookTemplate) and connection factory from feature branch
3. Includes ReconnectFilter for connection management
4. Maintains existing DisconnectController and other social media configurations
5. Preserves proper Spring Social import order and package structure

The changes are complementary rather than conflicting - the HEAD adds annotation-based configuration while the feature branch adds concrete Facebook API implementations and connection management utilities.
