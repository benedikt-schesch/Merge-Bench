Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the line where the DefaultFacebookClient is being instantiated. The HEAD version uses Version.VERSION_2_5, while the other branch (a17acec) uses Version.VERSION_2_2. 

First, I need to understand what the intent of both changes is. The version parameter here likely refers to the Facebook API version. Upgrading the API version from 2.2 to 2.5 could be necessary for using newer features or complying with API deprecations. Conversely, the other branch might be using 2.2 for compatibility reasons, perhaps if some part of the code isn't compatible with 2.5 yet.

Since both changes are modifying the same line, it's a textual conflict. To resolve this semantically, I should determine which API version is appropriate. If the project has standardized on a newer version, like 2.5, then keeping that makes sense. Alternatively, if the other branch's change is more recent or correct, maybe 2.2 is right. But without additional context, it's hard to tell which version is intended.

The user said to resolve it based on intent and semantics. If both changes are intentional but conflicting, and there's no way to discern the correct version, the conflict remains. However, maybe the correct approach is to pick the higher version if upgrading is standard practice. But I'm not sure. Since the user instructions say to return the same snippet with the conflict if unsure, perhaps the safest bet is to leave the conflict as is. Wait, but maybe the user expects me to make a decision. Alternatively, maybe the test should work with either version, but that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, check if the parameters are compatible. If Version is an enum, only one can be correct. Since the test is about posting an image with a message, maybe both API versions support that endpoint. But perhaps one of the versions is incorrect. For example, if 2.2 is deprecated, then using 2.5 is correct. But without knowing the project's API version, it's ambiguous. Therefore, the conflict can't be resolved automatically, and the user should decide. So the correct resolution is to leave the conflict markers because the intent is ambiguous.</think>
```java

  @Test
  public void postImageToPagePhotosWithMessage() {
    byte[] imageAsBytes = fetchBytesFromImage();
    DefaultFacebookClient client =
<<<<<<< HEAD
        new DefaultFacebookClient(getTestSettings().getPageAccessToken(), Version.VERSION_2_5);
=======
        new DefaultFacebookClient(getTestSettings().getPageAccessToken(), Version.VERSION_2_2);
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    JsonObject obj = client.publish(getTestSettings().getPageId() + "/photos", JsonObject.class,
      BinaryAttachment.with("test.png", imageAsBytes, "image/png"), Parameter.with("message", "TestImage"),
      Parameter.with("no_story", "true"));
    assertNotNull(obj);
  }

```

The conflict remains unresolved as both changes modify the API version parameter with semantically different values (VERSION_2_5 vs VERSION_2_2). This represents a genuine version compatibility choice that requires human judgment to resolve based on:  
1. Which API version is actively supported by the project  
2. Which version aligns with other components in the codebase  
3. Which version actually supports the `/photos` endpoint parameters used in the test  
4. External documentation about Facebook API version differences

The rest of the test setup and assertions are identical in both versions.
