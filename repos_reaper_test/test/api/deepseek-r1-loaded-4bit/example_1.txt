Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The two versions are changing the "version" entry in the data map. The HEAD version uses bungee.getConfig().getCustomServerName() followed by the game version, while the other branch uses "BungeeCord " plus the game version.

Hmm, so the conflict is about how the version string is constructed. The HEAD seems to allow a customizable server name from the config, whereas the other branch hardcodes "BungeeCord". The intent here might be that one side added customization, and the other kept it static.

I need to decide which one to choose. If both changes are valid, maybe the custom name from the config is preferred because it's more flexible. But wait, maybe the correct resolution is to combine both? Wait, no, they're both setting the same key. So it's either one or the other.

If the HEAD is a newer change that introduces customization, it's better to keep that. The other branch's version is the older, hardcoded one. So resolving in favor of HEAD would preserve the customization feature. But I need to make sure there's no other context. Since the user hasn't provided more info, I'll assume that the HEAD's change is intentional and should be kept. Therefore, the resolved line should use the custom server name from the config.</think>
```java

                data.put( "hostname", listener.getMotd() );
                data.put( "gametype", "SMP" );
                // Start Extra Info
                data.put( "game_id", "MINECRAFT" );
                data.put( "version", bungee.getConfig().getCustomServerName() + " " + bungee.getGameVersion() );
                data.put( "plugins", "" );
                // End Extra Info
                data.put( "map", "BungeeCord_Proxy" );
                data.put( "numplayers", Integer.toString( bungee.getOnlineCount() ) );
                data.put( "maxplayers", Integer.toString( listener.getMaxPlayers() ) );

```

Rationale: The conflict resolution preserves the configurable server name from HEAD (`bungee.getConfig().getCustomServerName()`) while maintaining the version formatting pattern from both branches. This combines the semantic intent of both versions by:
1. Keeping the customization capability added in HEAD
2. Maintaining the space-separated version format used in both branches
3. Avoiding hardcoding "BungeeCord" while still allowing it via configuration if desired
