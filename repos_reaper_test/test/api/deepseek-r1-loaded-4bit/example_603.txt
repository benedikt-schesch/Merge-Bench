Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is between the HEAD version and the a17acec commit. Both sides are trying to get the "data" from rawPicture, but they're doing it differently.

In the HEAD version, they're using rawPicture.get("data").toString(). The other side uses rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString(). The key difference here is whether "data" is a JsonObject or a general object.

I need to figure out the intent here. If rawPicture is a JSON object, maybe the correct method is getJsonObject to specifically retrieve a nested JSON object. The HEAD version's get("data") might return a generic Object, which could cause issues if it's not a JsonObject. The other side's approach ensures that "data" is treated as a JsonObject, which might be necessary for proper serialization.

So, the a17acec change is probably a fix to correctly access the JSON object, avoiding a potential ClassCastException or similar issue. Therefore, resolving the conflict by choosing the getJsonObject method makes sense semantically. That way, both the intent of accessing the "data" as a JSON object and converting it to a string is preserved.</think>
```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

    String picJson = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString();
    picture = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(picJson, ProfilePictureSource.class);
  }
