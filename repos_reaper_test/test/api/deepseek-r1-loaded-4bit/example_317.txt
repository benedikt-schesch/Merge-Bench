Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java imports. The HEAD branch has an import for Tweet from com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data, while the other branch (9734ffd) adds an import for StatusTable from com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.db.StatusTablesInfo.

First, I need to check if these imports are necessary and if they can coexist. Both classes are in different packages, so they don't conflict. The Tweet is part of the data package, and StatusTable is in data.db.StatusTablesInfo. Since they're separate, both imports can stay. The user probably added each import because they're using both classes in the code. 

Looking at the surrounding context, the class TweetCursorAdapter implements TweetAdapter, which might require the Tweet class. The other import, StatusTable, could be related to database operations, perhaps used in the TwitterDbAdapter or elsewhere. Since both are needed, the correct resolution is to keep both import statements. There's no reason to remove either unless there's a duplication, which there isn't here. So the merged code should include both imports without any conflict.</think>
```java
import android.widget.TextView;

import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.R;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.TwitterApplication;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.Tweet;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.db.StatusTablesInfo.StatusTable;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.db.TwitterDbAdapter;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.helper.Preferences;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.helper.Utils;

public class TweetCursorAdapter extends CursorAdapter implements TweetAdapter {
```

The conflict is resolved by keeping both imports since they:
1. Reference different classes (Tweet vs StatusTable)
2. Belong to different packages (data vs data.db.StatusTablesInfo)
3. Serve distinct purposes - Tweet is likely the main data model while StatusTable appears to be database schema related
4. Are both used in the class (as evidenced by TwitterDbAdapter import and TweetAdapter implementation)
