Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The code in question is adding a new Game instance to the gameManager's games. The HEAD version has the constructor with 12 arguments, while the other branch (ed08e371) has 14 arguments. The additional arguments in the latter are two more falseProvider and gameOptionsProvider.

First, I need to understand what each side is doing. The original code in HEAD uses a certain set of parameters, and the other branch is adding more parameters to the Game constructor. This could be a case where a new feature or configuration option was added to the Game class in one branch, requiring additional parameters.

Looking at the parameters, both versions start with the same initial arguments: 1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider, formatProvider. Then HEAD has falseProvider, formatProvider. The other branch adds falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider. Wait, actually, let me count again.

HEAD's line:
new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider));

That's 12 parameters. The other branch's line:
new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));

So that's 14 parameters. The additional ones are another falseProvider and gameOptionsProvider at the end.

The question is, which parameters are correct? If the Game constructor in the current codebase expects 14 parameters, then the ed08e371 version is correct. Alternatively, if the HEAD version is correct with 12, but the other branch added two more, then we need to merge those.

But since this is a merge conflict, it's possible that one branch added some parameters, and the other branch didn't. So maybe the correct resolution is to include all the necessary parameters from both branches.

Wait, but in the conflict, the two versions are different in the number of parameters. The HEAD has 12, the other has 14. So the correct resolution depends on which branch's changes are intended to be kept. However, since the user is asking to resolve based on intent and semantics, perhaps the ed08e371 branch added two new parameters to the Game constructor, and the HEAD version didn't have those. Therefore, when merging, we should take the version with the additional parameters because that's likely a necessary change in one branch.

Alternatively, maybe the parameters were reordered or some were added in one branch and others in another. But in this case, the conflict is straightforward: the two versions differ in the number of arguments passed to the Game constructor.

Assuming that the ed08e371 branch is introducing new features that require those additional parameters, the correct resolution would be to keep the version from ed08e371. However, if the HEAD version is the correct one, then we should keep that. But without more context on why these parameters are added, it's hard to say.

But the user said to think in terms of intent. Both sides are trying to create a Game instance. The HEAD version might be an older version, and the other branch adds more configuration options. The line in the test is about making sure the game reuses the ID, so the parameters passed to the Game constructor are probably part of the test setup. If the test in the other branch requires the additional parameters, then those need to be included. If the HEAD version's test doesn't have those parameters, but the Game constructor now expects them, then the test would fail without them.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the version from the ed08e371 branch, as it's adding necessary parameters to the Game constructor. The spacing difference (indentation) can be adjusted for consistency. The HEAD version uses 4 spaces for the parameters, while the other branch uses 4 spaces for the first line and 8 for the next. But in the resolved code, we can adjust the formatting for consistency. However, the user instructed to preserve spacing as is. Wait, the user said: "make sure you do not modify the context at all and preserve the spacing as is." So we can't adjust the indentation. Wait, but the conflict markers are in the code, and the user wants the entire snippet with the conflict resolved.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "If you are not sure on how to resolve the conflict or if the intent is ambiguous, please return the same snippet with the conflict." But if we can resolve it, we should.

But why are there two more parameters in the ed08e371 version? It's possible that in that branch, the Game constructor was modified to require those parameters. So when merging, if both branches modified the same line, the correct approach is to take the parameters from both. But since they are conflicting, it's more likely that one branch added parameters that the other didn't. So the ed08e371 version is the correct one. Therefore, the resolved code should take the version from ed08e371, with the additional parameters. Therefore, the correct merged line is the one from ed08e371.

But wait, the user's example shows that the conflict is in the parameters passed to the Game constructor. The HEAD version has 12 parameters, the other has 14. The correct resolution is to include all the parameters required by the current version of the Game constructor. Since we don't have the actual class definition here, we have to infer. If the ed08e371 branch is adding new parameters, then that's the correct version. So, the merged code should include the parameters from ed08e371. Therefore, the resolved line would be:

new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
    formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));

But need to check the indentation. The HEAD version has the parameters starting with 12 spaces (assuming the line starts after 'put(1,' which is on the same line). The HEAD continuation line has parameters indented with 12 spaces (the line starts with 'new Game(...' which is under the put(1, line). Wait, looking at the original code:

HEAD:
gameManager.getGames().put(1,
            new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
                    formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider));

The ed08e371 version:
gameManager.getGames().put(1,
        new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));

The indentation for the ed08e371 version is less indented. But the user says to preserve spacing as is. So we need to keep the exact indentation from the resolved version. But since we are merging, perhaps the correct approach is to take the parameters from the ed08e371 branch, including the indentation. However, in the code after the merge, the indentation should be consistent with the surrounding code.

But the user's instruction is to preserve spacing as is. So if the ed08e371 version's line is indented with 8 spaces (as in the code: '    new Game(...'), and the HEAD uses 12, but perhaps that's just a formatting difference. However, the user's example shows that the conflict is in the parameters, and the surrounding code has the line starting with 'gameManager.getGames().put(1,' followed by the new Game constructor.

In the HEAD version, the parameters are:

new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
                    formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider));

So the first line of the Game constructor is indented with 12 spaces (after the put(1,), and the second line is indented with 20 spaces (assuming the code uses 4-space indentation, but not sure). The ed08e371 version has:

new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));

Here, the second line is indented with 12 spaces. So the HEAD's second line is more indented, and ed08e371's second line is less. To resolve this, we need to choose the correct indentation. Since the user says to preserve spacing as is, maybe we should take the ed08e371 version's indentation. But the user said not to modify the context at all except resolving the conflict.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to accept the parameters from ed08e371 but keep the indentation from one of the versions. However, the user's instruction says to preserve the spacing as is. Wait, the user says: "make sure you do not modify the context at all and preserve the spacing as is." So, when merging, we should take the content from one side or the other, including their spacing. So if the ed08e371 version has different indentation, we should keep that.

But in this case, the conflict is only on the parameters passed to the Game constructor. So the merged code should have the parameters from ed08e371, including their indentation.

So the resolved code would be:

gameManager.getGames().put(1,
        new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));

But the surrounding code's indentation might be different. However, since the user instructed to preserve spacing, we have to keep the ed08e371's spacing. Therefore, the merged line is the one from the ed08e371 branch, with the additional parameters.

Therefore, the final resolved code would include the line from the ed08e371 branch, with the 14 parameters and the indentation as in that branch.</think>
