Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict between the HEAD and a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe.

Looking at the HEAD side, there's a comment block starting with /** that's been closed with }. Then, after the conflict markers, the other side adds a new inner class Picture that extends ProfilePictureSource, along with a TODO comment to remove it on type refactoring. Then there's another comment block about the Sport Graph API type.

The conflict is between the HEAD possibly removing or modifying something and the other branch adding the Picture class. Wait, in the HEAD, the code after the conflict starts with the Represents the Sport API type comment. So in HEAD, maybe the Picture class was removed, while the other branch still has it. But the other branch's code includes the Picture class with a TODO to remove it. 

So the intent of the other branch is to add a deprecated Picture class that should be removed later. The HEAD branch might have already removed it as part of the refactoring mentioned in the TODO. So the conflict arises because one side removed it and the other added it with a TODO.

But looking at the code structure: the conflict markers are around the Picture class. In the HEAD version, after the } that closes the previous class, there's a comment block for the Sport API type. In the other branch, between the two comment blocks, there's the Picture class.

If the HEAD has removed the Picture class (since the TODO says to remove it on type refactoring), then merging should keep that removal. But if the other branch is adding it with the TODO, perhaps that's an older change that's being refactored away in HEAD. So the correct resolution would be to remove the Picture class, as per the HEAD version, since the TODO indicates it's meant to be removed. Therefore, the conflict should be resolved by accepting the HEAD's removal and discarding the Picture class addition from the other branch.

But wait, maybe the other branch added the Picture class with the TODO, and the HEAD branch has a different change. Or perhaps the HEAD branch's code doesn't include the Picture class, which is why there's a conflict when the other branch adds it. The conflict is in the JavaDoc comments. Let me check again.

Original code:

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
   * @TODO remove this on type refactoring
   */
  public static class Picture extends ProfilePictureSource {
    // nothing here
  }

  /**
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

So the HEAD side doesn't have the Picture class and its comment, while the other branch does. The conflict is whether to include that Picture class or not.

If the intent of the other branch is to add a temporary class with a TODO to remove it, but the HEAD branch has already done the refactoring (removed it), then the correct resolution is to omit the Picture class. Therefore, the resolved code should take the HEAD version, which doesn't include the Picture class, and thus the conflict is resolved by keeping the HEAD's structure and discarding the conflicting addition from the other branch.

But wait, maybe the other branch's addition is necessary. However, given the TODO says to remove it on type refactoring, perhaps the HEAD has already performed that refactoring, hence the class is no longer present. Therefore, the merge should exclude the Picture class, accepting the HEAD's version.

So the resolved code would be the HEAD's part without the Picture class, followed by the Sport API comment. Therefore, the conflict markers are removed, and the Picture class from the other branch is not included.</think>
