Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict between the HEAD version and the branch b782a4b. Looking at the lines, the HEAD side has the registry registering the listener, and then the tearDown method. The other side adds a line where projectConfigurationManager is set using MavenPlugin.getProjectConfigurationManager() right after registering the listener.

I need to determine if these changes are compatible. The line from the branch is adding a new statement, so unless there's a reason these can't coexist, they should both be included. Since they're separate statements—one registers a listener, the other initializes a project configuration manager—it's likely that both are intended to be there. The user probably added the projectConfigurationManager line in their branch, and the main branch added the listener registration. So the correct resolution is to keep both lines, placing the new line after the registry call. That way, both changes are incorporated without conflict. The surrounding context doesn't show any overlapping modifications, so this should resolve the conflict semantically.</think>
```java
		buildService.setJdk(jdk);
		
		listener = new DummyAndroidBuildListener();

		registry.registerBuildListener(listener);
		projectConfigurationManager = MavenPlugin.getProjectConfigurationManager();
    }

	@Override
	protected void tearDown() throws Exception {
		listener.clear();
```
