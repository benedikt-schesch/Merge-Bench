Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the buildGetRequest method. The HEAD version returns a new MockLowLevelHttpRequest without any parameters, while the other branch includes the url as a parameter. 

I need to figure out the intent of both changes. Maybe the HEAD version was an older implementation where the constructor didn't require a URL, and the other branch updated the constructor to take the URL parameter. If the MockLowLevelHttpRequest's constructor now expects the URL, then including it would be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the HEAD version was a mistake, and the correct approach is to pass the URL.

Since the two branches are adding and not including the URL, the semantic resolution would be to include the URL parameter because that's likely the intended update. The conflict arises because one side added the parameter. Assuming that the MockLowLevelHttpRequest's constructor was modified to require the URL, the correct resolution is to use the version with the URL. Therefore, the resolved code should have return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url); and remove the conflict markers.</think>
