Okay, so I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code snippet. Let me look at the changes from both sides.

The HEAD version has some static imports for JUnit assertions and Hamcrest matchers. The other branch, which is 7d8e78a, is importing Girocode.Encoding and the Test annotation from JUnit, along with some other imports.

First, I notice that the conflicting parts are in the import statements. The HEAD side is importing assertion methods and matchers, while the other side is importing a specific class (Girocode.Encoding) and the Test annotation, plus maybe other necessary imports.

The goal here is to combine both sets of imports without duplication. Let me check each import line.

The HEAD has:
- import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
- import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;
- import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.instanceOf;
- import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;

The other branch has:
- import net.glxn.qrgen.core.scheme.Girocode.Encoding;
- import org.junit.Test;

So, these are different imports. The static imports from JUnit and Hamcrest are on one side, and the Test import and Girocode.Encoding on the other. They don't conflict in terms of overlapping lines, so they can be merged by including all of them.

But wait, the order might matter. In Java, imports are usually grouped with static imports first, then package imports. But in the original code, the HEAD has static imports first, then the other branch adds non-static imports. So merging them would require combining all static imports from HEAD and the non-static ones from the other branch.

Looking at the code after the merge, the correct approach is to include all the necessary imports from both branches. So the static imports for JUnit assertions and Hamcrest matchers should stay, and the imports for Girocode.Encoding and org.junit.Test should be added.

Also, the other branch might have some other necessary imports like java.io and java.util, but those are already present in both versions, so they can stay as is.

So the resolved imports section should have all the static imports from HEAD, followed by the non-static imports from both branches. That means:

- Keep all the static imports from HEAD.
- Add the import for Girocode.Encoding and org.junit.Test from the other branch.
- Ensure that the other imports (java.io and java.util) are present once.

Let me check the original code again. The conflict is between the two sets of imports. The HEAD's imports are all static, while the other branch's imports are non-static (except maybe the Test import, which is a regular import). So the correct merged imports would include all the static imports from HEAD and the non-static imports from the other branch.

Wait, the other branch has "import org.junit.Test;" which is a regular import. So merging both, we should have the static imports first, then the regular imports.

So the resolved code should have:

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.instanceOf;
import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;

import net.glxn.qrgen.core.scheme.Girocode.Encoding;
import org.junit.Test;

import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;
import java.util.Set;

Yes, that makes sense. Both sets of imports are needed, and they don't conflict with each other. The Test import is necessary for the test methods, and the Girocode.Encoding is a class import. The static imports are for the test assertions. So combining them all would resolve the conflict without any issues.</think>
```java
package net.glxn.qrgen.core.scheme;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.instanceOf;
import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import net.glxn.qrgen.core.scheme.Girocode.Encoding;
import org.junit.Test;

import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;
import java.util.Set;
