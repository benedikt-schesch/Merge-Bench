Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the two versions.

The conflict is around the line where mFavorited is assigned. The HEAD version uses TwitterDbAdapter.KEY_FAVORITED, while the other branch uses StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED.

First, I should check if these two constants are the same. If they're different names for the same column, maybe there was a refactor. StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED seems more descriptive, perhaps replacing a generic KEY from TwitterDbAdapter. But I need to be sure.

Looking at the surrounding code, other columns like mSourceColumn and mInReplyToScreenName are using StatusTable.FIELD_... constants. That suggests consistency in using StatusTable's fields. The HEAD version's use of TwitterDbAdapter.KEY_FAVORITED might be outdated. The other branch's change aligns with the surrounding code's style.

So the intent here is probably to standardize all column index lookups to use StatusTable constants. Therefore, the correct resolution is to pick the version from the branch (StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED) to maintain consistency.</think>
```java
			mSourceColumn = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_SOURCE);
			mInReplyToScreenName = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_IN_REPLY_TO_SCREEN_NAME);
			mFavorited = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED);
		}
		mMetaBuilder = new StringBuilder();
	}

	private LayoutInflater mInflater;

```

The conflict is resolved by choosing `StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED` since:
1. All other column indices in this context use StatusTable constants
2. This maintains naming consistency with the pattern established by the surrounding code
3. The `StatusTable.FIELD_*` pattern appears to be the newer/more specific convention compared to the generic `TwitterDbAdapter.KEY_*`
