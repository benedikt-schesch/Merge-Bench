Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the PageStartDate class. On the HEAD side, there's a line adding a serialVersionUID, and on the other branch (a17acec...), that line is removed.

First, I need to understand what each side is doing. The HEAD adds a serialVersionUID, which is a common practice in Java classes that implement Serializable. It's used for versioning when deserializing. The other branch doesn't have this line, maybe because they didn't think it was necessary or perhaps it was removed intentionally.

Now, I need to determine if keeping the serialVersionUID is important. Since the class extends AbstractFacebookType, I should check if that parent class is serializable. If AbstractFacebookType implements Serializable, then adding serialVersionUID here makes sense for version control. If not, maybe it's not needed.

Assuming that the parent class is serializable, the HEAD's addition is correct. The other branch might have removed it by mistake or because they thought it wasn't needed. However, in Java, if a class implements Serializable and doesn't define serialVersionUID, the compiler generates one, but it's fragile because changes to the class can change the generated ID. So explicitly defining it is a good practice.

Therefore, resolving the conflict by keeping the serialVersionUID from HEAD makes sense. The other changes (the getter, setter, and @Facebook annotations) are the same on both sides, so no issue there. The conflict is only about the presence of the serialVersionUID line.

So the merged code should include the serialVersionUID. The markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) should be removed, and the line from HEAD should be kept. That way, both the annotations and the version UID are present, which should be compatible.</think>
```java
    private PageStartDate date;
  }

  public static class PageStartDate extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private Integer year;
