Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code has two different versions in the HEAD and the other branch. The conflict is in the assertions after creating a GoogleJsonResponseException.

In HEAD, they're checking that responseException.getDetails() is null and then constructing expectedMessage with "200\nGET " plus the URL. They assert that the message equals expectedMessage.

In the other branch (47d0018), they're using 'ge' instead of 'responseException', which might be a typo or a variable name change. They assert ge.getDetails() is null and that the message starts with "200".

Wait, the variable name difference is a problem. The original code declares 'responseException', but the other branch uses 'ge'. That's probably a mistake. So the correct variable is responseException, so the branch's code has a typo. Therefore, we should keep the variable name as responseException.

Looking at the assertions: HEAD checks the full message matches a specific string, while the other branch just checks if it starts with "200". The message in HEAD includes the HTTP method and URL, which might be more precise. However, maybe the other branch's change is to relax the check to just the status code, perhaps because the URL part is variable or not necessary.

But the variable name in the branch is 'ge', which doesn't exist here. That's a problem. So the branch's code is incorrect because 'ge' isn't declared. So that suggests that the branch's code has an error, and we should take the HEAD version. Alternatively, maybe 'ge' is a typo and should be 'responseException'.

Assuming that the branch intended to use the correct variable name, maybe the correct resolution is to take both assertions: check that getDetails() is null, and that the message starts with "200" and also check the full message. But that might be redundant. Alternatively, maybe the intended semantics are to check that there are no details and that the message starts with the status code.

Wait, the test names: the current test is probably testFrom_withoutDetails, and there's another test testFrom_withDetails. So in this test (without details), the details should be null. The message in HEAD is constructed with the status code, method, and URL. The other branch just checks the message starts with the status code.

Which approach is better? If the exact message is important, then the HEAD's assertion is better. But if the branch is trying to make the test less brittle by not checking the entire message, which might change, then checking startsWith("200") is better.

But the variable name in the branch's code is wrong. So that's a mistake. Therefore, the correct code should use responseException, not ge. So the branch's code has a typo. Therefore, we should correct that.

So the resolved code would be:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "200\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

Wait, but that's combining both. But maybe the intention of the branch was to change the assertion to check startsWith, perhaps because the rest of the message might vary. However, the HEAD has a specific expected message. So perhaps the two branches are conflicting in their approach. If we can't determine which is correct, maybe we should keep both assertions. But that might be redundant. Alternatively, maybe the correct resolution is to take the startsWith from the branch but fix the variable name, and remove the assertEquals. But that depends on the intent.

Alternatively, maybe the branch was trying to simplify the test, but the HEAD has a more precise check. If both are valid, perhaps we need to see which one is correct. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given that the variable name in the branch is incorrect (ge vs responseException), the branch's code is incorrect. Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the HEAD version. Unless the variable was renamed in the branch, but there's no indication of that.

Alternatively, maybe 'ge' is a typo and should be 'responseException', so the branch's code should be:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

But that would replace the assertEquals with a startsWith. So the conflict is between checking the exact message vs checking that it starts with 200.

If both changes are valid, perhaps the intended resolution is to check both? But that's unlikely. The merge conflict arises because both branches modified the same lines. The correct resolution depends on the intent. If one branch is adding a more general check (startsWith) and the other is being more specific, perhaps we need to choose one or the other.

Alternatively, maybe the branch is correcting an issue where the exact message is not reliable, so switching to startsWith. But since the variable name in the branch is wrong, it's a mistake. Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the HEAD's code, fixing the variable name in the branch's part.

Wait, the HEAD has:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "200\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());

The branch has:

    assertNull(ge.getDetails());
    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

Assuming that 'ge' is a typo and should be 'responseException', then the branch's code would be:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

But that removes the check on the exact message. So the two changes are conflicting in their approach. So how to resolve that?

If the intent is to check that the message starts with the status code, and the exact message is not important, then the branch's change is correct. But if the exact message is important, then the HEAD is correct.

Without more context, it's hard to know. But given that the test is named testFrom_withDetails (no, wait, the test here is probably testFrom without details, and there's another test for with details), but the code here is part of a test that's checking the case where there are no details. So the message may include the status code and request details.

If the branch's intention was to relax the assertion to just check the start, perhaps because the exact URL might vary in different environments, but the status code is important, then the branch's approach is better. However, the variable name is incorrect. So the correct resolution would be to correct the variable name and use the branch's assertion.

But the user asked to resolve the conflict by considering the intent and semantics. If both changes are valid but conflicting, and the variable name in the branch is wrong, then perhaps the correct approach is to take the HEAD's variable name and the branch's assertion, but that would require combining both. Wait, but the two branches are modifying the same lines. The HEAD has two lines (assertNull and assertEquals), while the branch has two lines (assertNull and assertTrue). So they both are asserting that getDetails() is null, but differ in how they check the message.

So the conflict is between:

HEAD:
assertNull(details);
assertEquals(expectedMessage, message);

Branch:
assertNull(details);
assertTrue(message startsWith "200");

Assuming the variable name is fixed, which assertion is better? If the branch is trying to make the test less brittle, perhaps checking startsWith is better. But if the exact message is important, then the HEAD's approach is correct.

But since the user says to think in terms of intent and semantics, maybe both assertions are needed. Or maybe the intended change is to check the message starts with 200, replacing the exact check. However, the exact message in HEAD includes the HTTP method and URL, which might be part of the error message. If the branch's intention was to check that the status code is present, but the rest isn't important, then combining both might not be necessary. But since it's a conflict, we need to choose between the two.

Alternatively, maybe the correct resolution is to keep the assertNull from both (they are the same) and then take both the assertEquals and the assertTrue. But that would require modifying the code beyond what's in either branch. However, the user says to make sure not to modify the context at all unless resolving the conflict. But if we can combine the two in a way that satisfies both intents, that would be better.

Wait, the original code in HEAD has:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "200\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());

The branch's code, after fixing the variable name, would be:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

But the two assertions are conflicting. So the merge conflict is between these two. The correct resolution depends on which assertion is correct. Since the user hasn't provided enough context to know why these changes were made, but the branch's code has a typo (ge), which is likely incorrect, the correct approach would be to correct the typo and see if the assertions can be merged.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended code is to have both assertions. But that would mean combining the two, which isn't present in either branch. However, the user instructs to return the resolved snippet if the intent is clear. If the intent is to check that the message starts with 200 and also includes the URL, then perhaps the branch's code is incomplete. Alternatively, the branch is simplifying the check.

Alternatively, maybe the correct resolution is to take the HEAD's exact message check but also check that it starts with 200, which is redundant, but possible. But since the exact message is checked, the startsWith is redundant. So that's unnecessary.

Given that the variable name in the branch is incorrect, and assuming that the branch intended to use the correct variable name, but changed the assertion, the correct resolution would be to take the branch's assertion but fix the variable name, replacing the assertEquals with assertTrue. However, that would mean discarding the exact message check from HEAD. But maybe the branch's change is more recent or intended to relax the test.

Alternatively, if both changes are needed, perhaps the conflict is resolved by including both assertions:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "200\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

But that's adding both, which may not be necessary. However, since the user wants to resolve the conflict by considering the semantics, and if both changes are valid, this could be a way. But I think the user expects one of the two.

Given the ambiguity, but noting that the branch's code has a typo, the correct resolution would likely be to take the HEAD version, as the branch's code is incorrect due to the variable name. Therefore, the resolved code would be the HEAD's lines. But wait, the branch is changing the assertion to check startsWith, perhaps for a good reason. But without knowing the reason, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct resolution is to take both changes by correcting the variable name in the branch's part and keep both assertions. But that would require modifying the code beyond what's present in either branch, which the user instructs not to do unless necessary. The user says to preserve context unless resolving the conflict. Since the conflict is in those lines, the resolution should modify only the conflict markers.

So, considering that the branch's code has a typo (ge), which is incorrect, and the HEAD's code is correct in variable name, but the branch's assertion might be intended, the correct resolution is to correct the variable name in the branch's part and keep their assertion. So:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

But that would discard the exact message check. However, if the branch intended to change the assertion to startsWith, then that's the correct approach. But since the user hasn't provided enough context, it's ambiguous. In such cases, if unsure, the conflict should remain. But the user says to return the same snippet with the conflict if unsure. However, the variable name in the branch is definitely wrong, so maybe the conflict can be resolved by correcting that.

Wait, the conflict is between:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "200\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
=======
    assertNull(ge.getDetails());
    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200"));
>>>>>>> 47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613

If we correct 'ge' to 'responseException' in the branch's part, the code becomes:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

But that would replace the HEAD's lines. So the resolved code would have the two lines from the branch (after correction), replacing the three lines from HEAD. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the correct resolution is to take both the assertNull and the two different assertions. But they are conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended code is to check that getDetails() is null and the message starts with 200, which is what the branch intended after fixing the variable. But the HEAD has a more specific check. If we can't determine which is correct, the conflict remains.

But given that the variable name in the branch is incorrect, and assuming it's a mistake, the correct resolution would be to fix that and take the branch's assertion. Therefore, the resolved code would be:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

So, replacing the HEAD's lines with the corrected branch lines.

But how to represent that in the merged code.

The original code in conflict is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "200\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
=======
    assertNull(ge.getDetails());
    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200"));
>>>>>>> 47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613

After correcting 'ge' to 'responseException' and fixing the syntax (the extra parenthesis in the branch's line), the resolved code becomes:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

So that's the resolution. But wait, in the branch's code, there's an extra closing parenthesis: "));" at the end. That's a syntax error. So the branch's code has a typo in the variable name and a syntax error. Therefore, the correct resolution is to fix both: use 'responseException' and remove the extra parenthesis.

So the corrected lines from the branch would be:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

But the HEAD has three lines, and the branch has two. So merging would replace the three lines with the two corrected lines.

Therefore, the resolved snippet would be:

    transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));
  }

  public void testFrom_withDetails() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport();
    HttpRequest request =

Wait, but the branch's code had an extra closing parenthesis. Wait, looking at the original conflict:

In the branch's part:

    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

Note the double closing )); at the end. That's a syntax error. So the original code in the branch has a typo in the variable and an extra parenthesis. So when merging, we need to correct that.

So the correct line is:

    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

But that still has an extra ). Wait, in Java, the assertTrue method takes a boolean, so the correct syntax is:

assertTrue(condition);

In the HEAD's code, the line is:

    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());

Which is correct.

The branch's code has:

    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

But with an extra closing parenthesis. So the original code in the branch is:

    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

But the user's input shows:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
=======
    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200"));
>>>>>>> 47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613

Wait, in the user's provided code, the branch's line ends with "200")); which is likely a typo. Let me check:

Looking back:

The user's code snippet shows:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "200\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
=======
    assertNull(ge.getDetails());
    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200"));
>>>>>>> 47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613

Wait, the branch's line is assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200")); with a single closing ). So perhaps the extra parenthesis was a mistake in the user's input. Assuming that the branch's code is correct except for the variable name.

Therefore, the corrected branch lines are:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

So replacing the variable name 'ge' with 'responseException' and keeping the assertTrue.

So the merged code would be:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

But in the original code, the HEAD has three lines (assertNull, String expected..., assertEquals), while the branch has two lines (assertNull, assertTrue). Therefore, merging would replace the three lines with the two corrected lines.

Thus, the final resolved code would have those two lines, with the corrected variable name and without the syntax error.

But the user instructed to return the entire snippet with the context preserved, making sure not to modify the context unless resolving the conflict. So the resolved code should have the two lines from the branch, corrected, replacing the three lines from HEAD.

Therefore, the resolved snippet is:

        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));
  }

  public void testFrom_withDetails() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport();
    HttpRequest request =

Wait, but the line after assertTrue has an extra closing parenthesis. In the original branch's code, it's written as assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200")); but in the user's input, it's written as:

>>>>>>> 47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613
  }

So the line is:

    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

But the user's input shows:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
=======
    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200"));
>>>>>>> 47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613

So the branch's line has a single closing ), which is correct. So after correcting 'ge' to 'responseException', the line is:

    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

Therefore, the resolved code is:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));

Thus, the conflict is resolved by taking the branch's assertions but correcting the variable name.</think>
