Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The user provided a Java code snippet with a conflict between the HEAD and another branch. The conflict is in the license headers.

First, I need to understand what each side is doing. The HEAD version has a comment block that starts with "distributed under the License..." and then there's a conflict marker. The other branch, from commit 1488b22, has a different comment block starting with "The Apache Software License, Version 1.1" and mentions the Apache Software Foundation.

Wait, the HEAD's comment seems to be part of an Apache License 2.0 notice, which typically has the "distributed on an 'AS IS' BASIS..." part. The other side is referencing the older Apache License 1.1, which might be from an older version of the file. But having both licenses in the header doesn't make sense. The user probably wants to keep the correct and current license.

Looking at the structure, the conflict occurs between the end of one comment block and the start of another. The HEAD's part ends with the "limitations under the License." line, and then there's a blank line. The other branch adds the older Apache 1.1 notice right after, but that's conflicting because both are trying to exist in the same place.

The correct resolution would be to keep the current license (probably Apache 2.0 from HEAD) and remove the older 1.1 version. Alternatively, maybe the other branch added some necessary copyright info. Wait, the HEAD's context doesn't include a copyright line, while the other branch has "Copyright (c) 2001-2002 The Apache Software Foundation..." which is important. So perhaps the HEAD version is missing the copyright line, and the other branch adds it. But in the conflict, the HEAD side has a blank line after the license, and the other side adds the copyright under the older license.

Wait, the conflict is between the end of the HEAD's license (which might be missing the copyright) and the other branch's older license with copyright. The correct approach is to include the copyright line from the other branch but ensure it's under the correct license. However, the Apache 2.0 license typically includes the copyright line before the license text. So maybe the HEAD is missing the copyright, and the other branch's addition is actually needed, but the license version is conflicting.

Wait, the HEAD's code has the Apache 2.0 text (the "distributed under the License..." part), but the other branch is adding the Apache 1.1 header with a copyright. That's a problem because you can't have both licenses. The user probably needs to retain the correct license and copyright. If the HEAD is using Apache 2.0, then the copyright should be included in that block, but maybe it's missing. The other branch's copyright line is important, but under the wrong license.

So the resolution would be to take the copyright line from the other branch and integrate it into the HEAD's license block. Let me check the structure again.

/*

Wait, the conflict is between the end of the HEAD's license block (which is the end of a comment) and the other branch's older license block. The HEAD's license ends with the "limitations..." line, then the closing */, then a blank line. The other branch's code starts a new comment block with the older license.

So the problem is that the HEAD has a license block (probably Apache 2.0) without a copyright line, and the other branch has an older license (Apache 1.1) with a copyright line. The correct resolution is to include the copyright line from the other branch but update the license to 2.0, assuming that's the intended license.

Therefore, the merged code should have the copyright line from the other branch inserted into the HEAD's license block. But looking at the HEAD's original code, maybe the copyright was accidentally removed. So the correct merge would be to add the copyright line from the other branch into the HEAD's block, but keep the Apache 2.0 text.

Wait, but in the HEAD's context, after the "limitations..." line, the comment block ends. Then there's a conflict. The other branch starts a new comment block with the older license. So merging would mean either keeping the HEAD's block (Apache 2.0 without copyright) or the other branch's block (Apache 1.1 with copyright). But that's conflicting.

But maybe the correct approach is that the HEAD's license is missing the copyright, and the other branch's code adds the copyright but with an outdated license. The solution is to take the copyright line from the other branch and place it into the HEAD's license block. So the merged code would look like:

/*
 * Copyright (c) 2001-2002 The Apache Software Foundation.  All rights
 * reserved.
 * 
 * distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
 * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
 * limitations under the License.
 */

But wait, the order matters. Typically, the copyright line comes first, then the license text. So in the HEAD's block, the copyright is missing. The other branch's code has the copyright but under the old license. So merging would involve taking the copyright from the other branch and placing it into the existing Apache 2.0 license block.

So the resolved code would be:

/*
 * Copyright (c) 2001-2002 The Apache Software Foundation.  All rights
 * reserved.
 *
 * distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
 * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
 * limitations under the License.
 */

This way, the copyright is included in the correct license block. Therefore, the conflict markers should be removed, and the two parts merged by inserting the copyright line into the HEAD's block and discarding the older license from the other branch.

So the final code after resolution would have the copyright line from the other branch added into the existing license block of the HEAD, ensuring that both the copyright and the correct license text are present.</think>
