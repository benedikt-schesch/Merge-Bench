Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the two versions.

In the HEAD version, the code initializes a TreeSet with explicit type parameters: new TreeSet<String>(Arrays.asList(...)). They also use new String[] to create the array. 

The other branch, from commit 5adedd2, uses the diamond operator <> for the TreeSet and directly passes the list of strings to Arrays.asList without creating a new String array. 

Hmm, both versions are trying to create an unmodifiable set of playtimes. The main differences are syntax-related: using the diamond operator and how the array is created for Arrays.asList. 

In Java, when you use Arrays.asList with varargs, you can just list the elements without the array syntax. So Arrays.asList("0.25x", "0.5x", ...) is correct and more concise. Also, the diamond operator <> in Java 7+ allows the compiler to infer the type, so new TreeSet<>() is sufficient. 

The HEAD version is more verbose, specifying the type and using new String[], which is redundant. The other branch simplifies it. Since both achieve the same result, the conflict can be resolved by adopting the cleaner syntax from the 5adedd2 branch. 

So the merged code should use the diamond operator and remove the explicit array creation. That way, both changes are incorporated without issues. No semantic differences here, just syntax improvements.</think>
