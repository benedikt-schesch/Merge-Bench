Okay, let's see. The user provided a Java code snippet with a merge conflict. The task is to resolve the conflict by understanding the intent of both sides without modifying the surrounding context.

Looking at the conflict, both versions have a comment that's almost identical. The HEAD version has "// first pass input location to the loader - for this send a" and the other side has "// first pass input location to the loader - for this send a " with an extra space at the end. 

Hmm, the difference is just a trailing space in the comment. That's probably a typo or accidental addition. Since the intent of both comments is the same, the conflict can be resolved by choosing either one. But which one? Maybe check which version is correct in terms of grammar or style. The comment seems to continue in the next line, so maybe the space was added by mistake. Or maybe it's part of a line wrap. 

Looking at the surrounding code, the comment continues on the next line, so the trailing space might not matter. But since both versions are semantically the same, the resolution would be to pick one. Since the HEAD version doesn't have the trailing space, maybe that's the intended one. Alternatively, maybe the other side added a space for formatting. However, in code comments, trailing spaces are usually not necessary. 

Therefore, the correct resolution is to remove the conflict markers and keep the HEAD version without the trailing space. The rest of the context remains unchanged. So the merged code would use the HEAD line.</think>

                // working dir to /user/<userid>
                if(!pigContext.getExecType().isLocal()) {
                    fs.setWorkingDirectory(jobcontext.getWorkingDirectory());
                }

                // first pass input location to the loader - for this send a
                // clone of the configuration we have - this is so that if the
                // loader (or the inputformat of the loader) decide to store the
                // input location into the configuration (for example,
                // FileInputFormat stores this in mapred.input.dir in the conf),
                // then for different inputs, the loader's don't end up
