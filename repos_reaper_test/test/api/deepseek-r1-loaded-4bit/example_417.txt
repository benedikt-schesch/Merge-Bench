Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java imports between two branches. The HEAD branch has imports for JBakeProperty and DocumentModel, while the other branch (d68ddea) imports PropertyList instead.

First, I need to understand what each side is doing. The HEAD version includes JBakeProperty and DocumentModel. The other side replaces JBakeProperty with PropertyList. Maybe these classes are related or one was renamed.

I should check if these imports are mutually exclusive or if they can coexist. If they're from the same package, maybe one was a refactor. For example, if PropertyList is a new class that replaces JBakeProperty, then keeping PropertyList makes sense. Alternatively, if they serve different purposes, both might be needed.

Looking at the package names: both are under org.jbake.app.configuration. JBakeProperty might be an enum or a list of properties, while PropertyList could be a utility class. DocumentModel is from org.jbake.model, which seems unrelated to the configuration classes. The other branch doesn't remove DocumentModel, so maybe that's still needed.

Wait, the conflict markers are only around the imports. The HEAD adds JBakeProperty and DocumentModel, while the other branch adds PropertyList. But looking at the code, the conflict is between two import lines. The HEAD has:

import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;

And the other branch has:

import org.jbake.app.configuration.PropertyList;

So the conflict is replacing those two imports with one. But maybe both are needed. Alternatively, maybe PropertyList was introduced to replace JBakeProperty, making JBakeProperty obsolete.

I need to consider the semantics. If the two branches are adding different configuration-related classes, perhaps both imports are necessary. But if they're alternatives, then we need to pick the correct one based on the latest changes.

Alternatively, maybe the DocumentModel import is unrelated and should stay, while the configuration imports are conflicting. In that case, maybe both JBakeProperty and PropertyList are needed, or one replaces the other.

Without more context, it's hard to tell. But since the user wants a semantic resolution, I need to see if both changes can be integrated. If the two configuration imports are from the same feature but different approaches, there might be a conflict. If they're separate features, both imports should remain.

Wait, looking at the conflict lines:

HEAD has:
import org.jbake.app.configuration.ConfigUtil;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.DefaultJBakeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;

The other branch has:
import org.jbake.app.configuration.ConfigUtil;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.DefaultJBakeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.PropertyList;

So the conflict is between JBakeProperty and DocumentModel vs. PropertyList. The DocumentModel is from a different package, so maybe it's still needed. The other branch might have added PropertyList and removed JBakeProperty, but the HEAD added DocumentModel. So perhaps the correct resolution is to include both PropertyList (from the other branch) and DocumentModel (from HEAD), along with JBakeProperty if it's still used.

Alternatively, maybe PropertyList replaces JBakeProperty. If that's the case, then we should import PropertyList instead of JBakeProperty, but keep DocumentModel.

Wait, but in the conflict, the HEAD side has both JBakeProperty and DocumentModel, while the other side has PropertyList. So the lines in conflict are:

<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
=======
import org.jbake.app.configuration.PropertyList;
>>>>>>> d68ddea...

So the conflict is between adding two imports (JBakeProperty and DocumentModel) vs. adding one (PropertyList). If both are necessary, the resolved code should include all three imports. But maybe the other branch's PropertyList is a replacement for JBakeProperty. Let me think.

If JBakeProperty was removed in the other branch and replaced with PropertyList, then in the resolved code, we should import PropertyList instead of JBakeProperty. However, the DocumentModel import from HEAD is still needed. Therefore, the correct imports would be:

import org.jbake.app.configuration.ConfigUtil;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.DefaultJBakeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.PropertyList;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;

That way, we take the PropertyList from the other branch and keep the DocumentModel from HEAD. This assumes that JBakeProperty is no longer needed and was replaced by PropertyList, and DocumentModel is still required.

Therefore, the resolved code should merge both changes by including PropertyList and DocumentModel, removing the conflict markers.</think>
