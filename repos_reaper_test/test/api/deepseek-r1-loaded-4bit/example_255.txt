Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let's look at the conflicting parts.

In the `visitMapLookUp` method, there's a conflict between the HEAD version and the other branch. The HEAD side has just a comment saying "// TODO Auto-generated method stub" and then the closing brace. The other branch adds an empty line with some whitespace before the closing brace.

The goal here is to figure out what both sides intended. The HEAD version might have removed some code or left the method empty. The other branch just added an empty line, which doesn't change functionality but might be a formatting preference.

Since the conflict is about whitespace, which doesn't affect the code's behavior, the best approach is to keep both changes. But wait, how do they overlap? The HEAD version has the TODO comment and no empty line, while the other branch adds an empty line after the comment. Merging them would mean having the TODO comment followed by an empty line. However, looking at the code, the conflict markers are around the lines between the comment and the closing brace.

Wait, the actual code in HEAD is:
// TODO Auto-generated method stub
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
        
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a
    }

So the HEAD side has nothing between the comment and the closing brace, and the other branch adds a line with some spaces. So the conflict is whether to have that empty line or not. Since adding an empty line is just formatting, maybe the correct resolution is to include the empty line from the other branch. But maybe the user wants to keep it compact. However, since both changes are non-functional, perhaps the best way is to accept both, but in this case, they are conflicting on the same spot. The HEAD has no line, the other branch adds a line. Since there's no semantic conflict, but just whitespace, perhaps we should take the change that adds the empty line. Or maybe the user intended to have the empty line for formatting. Alternatively, maybe the other branch's addition is unnecessary, but without more context, it's hard to tell.

But the user said to think in terms of intent. Both sides are modifying the same line. The HEAD might have removed some code, and the other branch added an empty line. But since the conflict is between the two versions, and the only difference is the empty line, perhaps the resolution is to include the empty line. Because the other branch added it, and the HEAD didn't have it. But maybe the HEAD version is the correct one. However, since the conflict is about an empty line, it's a minor formatting issue. The safest approach is to keep the empty line, as it doesn't affect functionality. So the resolved code would have the TODO comment, then the empty line from the other branch, then the closing brace.

Wait, looking again: the conflict is between the lines after the TODO comment. The HEAD side has nothing (so the line after the comment is the closing brace), and the other branch has a line with some spaces. So merging would result in having the TODO comment, then the empty line, then the closing brace. That seems reasonable. So the resolved code would be:

    public void visitMapLookUp(POMapLookUp mapLookUp) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        
    }

Because the empty line is added by the other branch. Since there's no other conflict, this would resolve it. The user's instruction says to return the resolved snippet if possible. Since this is a whitespace change and doesn't affect semantics, it's safe to merge by including the empty line.</think>
```java
        //do nothing
    }

    public void visitMapLookUp(POMapLookUp mapLookUp) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        
    }

    public void visitCast(POCast cast) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    }

```
