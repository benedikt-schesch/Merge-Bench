Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java import statements. The HEAD branch has added some new imports: POPoissonSample, POPreCombinerLocalRearrange, PORank, and POReservoirSample. The other branch, 88ae4a5, has POPreCombinerLocalRearrange and PORank but not the others.

Wait, both sides have POPreCombinerLocalRearrange and PORank. So the conflict arises because HEAD added two more imports (POPoissonSample and POReservoirSample) that the other branch doesn't have. The other branch might have a different order or perhaps omitted those. But looking at the code, the conflict markers show that in HEAD, after POPackage, they added POPoissonSample, POPreCombinerLocalRearrange, PORank, POReservoirSample. The other branch only has POPreCombinerLocalRearrange and PORank. 

So the resolution should include all the imports from both sides without duplication. Since POPreCombinerLocalRearrange and PORank are present in both, they should be listed once. Then include the unique ones from each side. Wait, but in the conflict, the HEAD has POPoissonSample and POReservoirSample, while the other branch doesn't. So the correct merge would be to keep all the imports from both, but without duplicates. Let me check the order. The original order in HEAD is after POPackage, then POPoissonSample, then POPreCombinerLocalRearrange, then PORank, then POReservoirSample. The other branch has after POPackage, POPreCombinerLocalRearrange, PORank. So the merged result should have all the imports from both, maintaining the order. Since the other branch's imports are a subset of HEAD's, except that they don't have the two new ones. Wait, no. The other branch's conflict part is adding POPreCombinerLocalRearrange and PORank, but HEAD's part includes those plus more. So merging them would include all the imports from HEAD and the other branch's additions? Wait, no. The conflict is between the two versions. The HEAD adds four imports, while the other branch adds two. But looking at the code, the imports in the conflict section are:

HEAD:
import POPoissonSample;
import POPreCombinerLocalRearrange;
import PORank;
import POReservoirSample;

Other branch:
import POPreCombinerLocalRearrange;
import PORank;

So the conflict is that HEAD has those four imports, and the other branch has two. The correct resolution is to include all four from HEAD, because the other branch's changes are already included in HEAD's additions. Wait, no. Wait, maybe the other branch added those two imports, and HEAD added those two plus two more. So when merging, we should include all four. Because the other branch's changes are adding POPreCombinerLocalRearrange and PORank, which are already in HEAD's version. So the merged code should include all the imports from HEAD, since they are a superset. Therefore, resolving the conflict by taking the HEAD version and discarding the other branch's changes. But wait, maybe the other branch was removing some imports? No, in this case, the conflict is in the middle of the import statements. The surrounding context after the conflict is the same in both branches. So the correct resolution is to keep all the imports from both sides. But since the other branch's part is a subset of HEAD's, the merged result should include all imports from HEAD. Therefore, the resolved code should have the four imports from HEAD, and the other branch's two are already included. So the conflict can be resolved by choosing the HEAD version, thus keeping all four imports. That way, all necessary imports are included without duplication.</think>
