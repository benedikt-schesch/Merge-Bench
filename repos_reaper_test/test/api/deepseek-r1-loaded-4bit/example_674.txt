Okay, let's see. I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. The conflict is in the mapRow method where they're creating a new AccountProviderParameters object. The HEAD version has more parameters: it includes displayName and callbackUrl, while the other branch (228af53) doesn't have those. 

First, I should check what parameters the AccountProviderParameters constructor expects. If the HEAD version added new parameters like displayName and callbackUrl, then the correct resolution would be to include those. The other branch might have removed them accidentally or maybe it's an older version.

Looking at the HEAD side, the constructor has provider, displayName, decrypted apiKey, decrypted secret, appId, requestTokenUrl, authorizeUrl, callbackUrl, accessTokenUrl. That's nine parameters. The other side has provider, apiKey, secret, appId, requestTokenUrl, authorizeUrl, accessTokenUrlâ€”only seven, missing displayName and callbackUrl. 

Assuming that the HEAD version is adding necessary fields like displayName and callbackUrl which are important for the functionality, those should be kept. The other branch's version might be missing these, possibly because it's based on an older implementation. 

So the correct resolution is to take the HEAD version's parameters, ensuring that all necessary fields are included. Therefore, the merged code should use the HEAD's constructor call with all nine arguments, preserving displayName and callbackUrl. 

I should also check if the SQL query SELECT_ACCOUNT_PROVIDER_BY_NAME includes the "displayName" and "callbackUrl" columns. If those columns exist in the database and are being selected, then including them here is correct. If not, that might be a problem. But given the context, I'll assume the HEAD version correctly added those columns to the query and the constructor.

Therefore, the resolved code should merge the HEAD version's constructor parameters, keeping all the necessary fields.</think>
```java

	private AccountProviderParameters getParameters(final String provider) {
		return jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(SELECT_ACCOUNT_PROVIDER_BY_NAME, new RowMapper<AccountProviderParameters>() {
			public AccountProviderParameters mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException {
				return new AccountProviderParameters(provider, rs.getString("displayName"), encryptor.decrypt(rs
						.getString("apiKey")), encryptor.decrypt(rs.getString("secret")), rs.getLong("appId"), rs
						.getString("requestTokenUrl"), rs.getString("authorizeUrl"), rs.getString("callbackUrl"), rs
						.getString("accessTokenUrl"));
			}
		}, provider);
	}
