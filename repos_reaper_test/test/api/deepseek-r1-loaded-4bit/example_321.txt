Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java import statements. The HEAD version has an import for StatusTable directly from com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.db, while the other branch (35866bda67daa370881be103a8ba2cd2fcd57332) is importing StatusTable from StatusTablesInfo under the same package and also adding an import for UserInfoTable.

First, I need to understand the intent of both sides. The HEAD branch is importing StatusTable directly, whereas the other branch has moved StatusTable into an inner class or a subpackage called StatusTablesInfo. Additionally, the other branch is adding UserInfoTable, which is a new import that the HEAD doesn't have.

To resolve this, I should combine both changes. The correct import for StatusTable should be from StatusTablesInfo, as that's the change from the other branch. So the line from HEAD (import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.db.StatusTable;) should be replaced with the one from the other branch. Also, the UserInfoTable import is new and should be included. 

So the resolved imports would include both the corrected StatusTable import and the new UserInfoTable. That way, both changes are incorporated without conflict. There's no ambiguity here because the other branch's import for StatusTable is more specific, and the addition of UserInfoTable is a separate line that doesn't interfere with the HEAD's other imports. Therefore, merging both imports should resolve the conflict correctly.</think>
```java
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.ProfileActivity;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.R;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.StatusActivity;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.Tweet;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.User;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.db.StatusTablesInfo.StatusTable;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.db.UserInfoTable;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.helper.Preferences;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.helper.Utils;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.task.GenericTask;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.task.TaskAdapter;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.task.TaskListener;
```

Rationale: Both branches agree on adding StatusTable import but with different paths. The correct resolution uses the more specific `StatusTablesInfo.StatusTable` from the feature branch while preserving the new `UserInfoTable` import. The HEAD version's direct StatusTable import appears to be an outdated path that's been refactored in the other branch.
