Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code in question is between the HEAD version and the branch version. The HEAD has a block where they're drawing the scene's bitmap directly onto the canvas using canvas.drawBitmap. The other side, from commit b31a7c3, replaces that with a call to scene.draw(canvas). 

So, the conflict is between two different ways of drawing the scene. The original approach uses the canvas to draw the bitmap from the scene's viewport, which might be more low-level. The other approach delegates the drawing to the scene's own draw method, which could encapsulate the drawing logic within the scene class.

To resolve this, I need to consider the intent of both changes. The HEAD version is probably an older way of doing things, where the drawing is handled externally. The branch version is moving the responsibility to the scene, which is better for encapsulation. If both changes are meant to coexist, maybe there's a reason, but more likely, the branch's change is an improvement or refactor. 

But wait, maybe the scene.draw(canvas) in the branch version is supposed to replace the manual drawing. If that's the case, keeping the branch's code makes sense because it's a cleaner approach. However, I need to check if there are any other changes or if the parameters in the drawBitmap call are important. The HEAD version has some parameters like null and scene.viewport.bitmapRect. If the scene.draw(canvas) method internally handles those parameters correctly, then the branch version is better. If not, maybe there's a mistake.

Since the user said to think about intent and semantics, if both changes are trying to achieve the same result but in different ways, the correct resolution is to pick the one that's more recent or correct. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, in merge conflicts, when two changes modify the same lines, we have to choose which one to keep. 

If the branch version (scene.draw(canvas)) is the intended newer method, then that's the correct resolution. Alternatively, maybe both are needed. But looking at the code structure, they are both in the same place, so it's an either/or situation. 

Assuming that the branch's commit is introducing a refactored method where the scene handles its own drawing, resolving the conflict by choosing scene.draw(canvas) makes sense. The manual drawBitmap call is replaced by a method call that encapsulates the drawing logic. Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the branch's version and remove the HEAD's code.</think>
```java
		
		// tell the scene to update it's viewport bitmap
		scene.update();
		
		// draw it
		scene.draw(canvas);
    	if (DEBUG){
    		long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
			double n = ((double)now)/1000L;
			double s = ((double)startTime)/1000L;
			double fps = 1L/(n-s);
