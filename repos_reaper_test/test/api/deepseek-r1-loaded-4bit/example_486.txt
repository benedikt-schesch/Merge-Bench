Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code has two different imports in the HEAD and the other branch. The HEAD version includes the FPSLogger, TextureOptions, BitmapTextureAtlas, BitmapTextureAtlasTextureRegionFactory, and TiledTextureRegion. The other branch, e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885, adds an import for VertexBufferObjectManager from the same package.

The conflict is in the import statements. Both sides are adding different imports. Since Java allows multiple imports and these are from the same package, there's no reason they can't coexist. The correct resolution is to include both imports. The order might not matter, but it's safe to keep them as they were in each branch. So, the HEAD has the first set, and the other branch adds the VertexBufferObjectManager. So, combining both by adding the VertexBufferObjectManager import line after the existing ones would resolve the conflict without any issues. There's no semantic overlap here; both imports are necessary for different parts of the code. Therefore, the merged code should include all the imports from both branches.</think>
