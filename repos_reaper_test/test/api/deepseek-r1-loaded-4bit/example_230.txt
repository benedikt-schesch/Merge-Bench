Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java code where a query string is being constructed. The HEAD version uses Util.encodeEscape on tmpFile.toString(), while the other branch (1488b22) uses Util.generateURI with a comment added about loading, executing, and storing the query.

First, I need to understand the intent of both changes. The HEAD side is encoding and escaping the file path, possibly to handle special characters in the URI. The other branch is using generateURI, which might be a newer or more appropriate method for generating a valid URI from the file path. Additionally, the comment in the other branch adds clarity about the purpose of the code block.

I should check if generateURI already includes the necessary encoding and escaping. If so, then using generateURI would be sufficient and the encodeEscape might be redundant. The comment is helpful, so it's good to keep that.

The conflict markers are around the assignment of the query variable. The correct resolution would be to take the comment from the incoming branch and use the generateURI method, as it's likely the intended method for URI handling. Therefore, merging the two by keeping the comment and the generateURI call makes sense. The encodeEscape from HEAD might not be needed if generateURI handles escaping internally.

So, the resolved code should include the comment, use generateURI, and ensure proper formatting without any conflict markers.</think>
```java
        PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(tmpFile));
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            ps.println(i+"\t"+i);
        }
        ps.close();

	//Load, Execute and Store query
        String query = "foreach (load '"+Util.generateURI(tmpFile.toString())+"') generate $0,$1;";
        System.out.println(query);
        pig.registerQuery("asdf_id = " + query);
        try {
            pig.deleteFile("frog");
        } catch(Exception e) {}
```
