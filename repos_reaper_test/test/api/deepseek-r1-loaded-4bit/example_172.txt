<think>
Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code has two versions from different branches. The HEAD version ends the if block with throwing an exception if the glob doesn't match. The other branch, from commit 1488b22..., adds an else clause where it sets elements and returns an iterator.

Hmm, the conflict is in the else block. In the HEAD version, after checking if the glob doesn't match, it throws an exception. The other branch adds an else to that if, meaning if the glob does match, then it proceeds to get the elements and return the iterator. But wait, the HEAD version doesn't have that else; it just throws, and then after the else block, returns the iterator. 

Wait, the structure in HEAD is: inside the else (which is the case where it's a glob), check if the glob doesn't match, throw. Then after that, return the iterator. But the other branch adds an else to the if (!globMatchesFiles), so if the glob does match, it sets elements and returns. Then after that, the return statement is still there. But in the other branch, after the else, they have the return. But in HEAD, the return is after the if-else block.

So merging these, maybe the intended logic is: if it's a glob, check if it doesn't match, throw. Else (if it does match), get elements and return. Otherwise, if not a glob, proceed. Wait, the outer else is for when it's a glob. So in the HEAD version, if the glob doesn't match, throw. Then, after that, return the iterator. But that would mean that if the glob does match, it would proceed to return the iterator. But in the other branch, they explicitly handle the case where the glob does match by setting elements and returning. 

Wait, in the HEAD code, after the if (!globMatchesFiles) throw, there's no else. So after the if, if it doesn't throw (i.e., the glob does match), then the code continues to return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements). But in the other branch, they have an else clause where they set elements and return. Then, outside of that else, they have the same return statement. That might lead to duplicate returns.

Wait, let's parse the original code. The HEAD version:

} else {
    // It's a glob
    if (!globMatches...) {
        throw...
    }
}
return new DataStorage...

So, if it's a glob, check if it doesn't match, throw. Otherwise (if it does match), proceed to return. But elements might not be set here. Wait, where is elements defined? In the other branch's code, they set elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); in the else clause. But in the HEAD version, elements is presumably set somewhere else, maybe in the if block (the non-else part). So maybe the elements variable is already defined, but in the other branch's code, they are setting it in the else.

This is confusing. The conflict arises because in one branch, after checking the glob, they handle the case where it does match by setting elements and returning immediately. In the other branch, after checking and throwing if it doesn't match, they proceed to return the iterator, which relies on elements being set elsewhere.

So the semantic intent here is: when it's a glob, if it doesn't match, throw. If it does match, collect the elements and return the iterator. The other branch's code adds the else clause to handle the matching case, setting elements and returning. However, the HEAD version then has a return statement after the else block, which would be redundant if the else clause already returns.

Wait, looking at the code again:

In the conflicting region:

<<<<<<< HEAD
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
=======
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
                
>>>>>>> 1488b22...

So in the HEAD version, after the if (!glob...) throw, the code closes the else block, then returns. In the other branch, after the throw, there's an else that sets elements and returns. Then the code after that (outside the else) would have the same return statement.

Wait, the code structure in the other branch would be:

} else {
    if (!glob...) {
        throw...
    } else {
        elements = ...;
        return ...;
    }
}
return ...;

So in that case, if the glob matches, the else clause is executed, elements is set, and it returns immediately. Then, after the else block, there's another return statement. But that return would never be reached because if the else is taken, it already returned. If the else isn't taken (i.e., the if (!glob) was true, it throws, so the code after is not executed. Wait, but the else is inside the outer else block. Let me try to outline:

The outer structure is:

if (something) {
    ...
} else {
    // It's a glob
    if (!globMatches) {
        throw...
    } else {
        elements = ...
        return ...
    }
}
return ...;

Wait, but in the other branch's code, after the else clause, there's a return statement. So if the code enters the else (glob matches), then it returns inside the else. Otherwise (if it's not a glob?), but the outer else is for when it is a glob. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

The correct resolution would be to ensure that when the glob matches, elements are properly set and the iterator is returned. In the HEAD version, elements must have been set somewhere else, perhaps in the case where it's not a glob. The other branch's code is adding handling for when it is a glob and the glob matches, setting elements and returning. However, the HEAD version has a return statement after the else block, which would be redundant if the other branch's code already returns in the else.

But maybe the elements variable is not initialized in the HEAD version's code path for the glob case. So if the code proceeds past the if (!glob) check (i.e., the glob does match), then elements is not set, leading to a possible error. The other branch's code fixes this by setting elements in the else clause and returning.

So the correct merge would be to include the else clause from the other branch, which sets elements and returns, and remove the redundant return statement after the else block. Wait, but in the provided code, the other branch's code includes the else clause and then the return is still there. Let me check the exact code again.

Original conflict:

<<<<<<< HEAD
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
=======
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
                
>>>>>>> 1488b22...
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);

Wait, in the HEAD version, after the closing } of the else block (which is the outer else), there's a return statement. In the other branch, inside the else, after setting elements, they return. Then, after the else block, there's another return. That would cause a problem because if the code enters the else clause, it would return there, and the code after the else block would also return. But in reality, the code after the else block is part of the outer structure.

Wait, perhaps the indentation is confusing. Let me re-express the code.

HEAD version:

        } else {
            // It might be a glob
            if (!globMatchesFiles(elem, elem.getDataStorage())) {
                throw new IOException(elem.toString() + " does not exist");
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);

Other branch's version:

        } else {
            // It might be a glob
            if (!globMatchesFiles(elem, elem.getDataStorage())) {
                throw new IOException(elem.toString() + " does not exist");
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
                
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);

Wait, so in the other branch's code, after the else clause (where they set elements and return), there's still a return statement outside. That would mean that if the code enters the else clause (glob matches), it returns there. Otherwise, if the if (!glob) is true, it throws. So the code after the else block (the return) would never be reached. That's a problem because the return after the else block is unreachable. Because in the else clause, there's a return, and if the if (!glob) is true, it throws. So the code after the else block (return) is never executed. Therefore, the return statement after the else block is redundant and should be removed.

But in the conflict, both versions have that return statement. The HEAD version has the return after the else block, while the other branch adds the else clause with a return inside, but also keeps the return outside. That's a bug. The correct resolution would be to have the else clause return, and remove the return after the else block.

But how to merge this? The other branch adds the else clause with return, but the return after is still present. So the merged code would have both, leading to unreachable code. That's incorrect. Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the else clause from the other branch, set elements and return, and remove the return statement after the else block.

However, looking at the original code snippets, the other branch's code includes the return inside the else, and then the return after. But in the HEAD code, the return is after the else block. So merging these would result in code that has both the return inside the else and the return after, which is not correct.

Therefore, the correct merge is to include the else clause from the other branch (setting elements and returning), and remove the return statement after the else block. But since the user instructed to return the entire snippet as provided, but resolve conflicts, maybe the intended resolution is to keep both, but that would be incorrect.

Wait, the user says to return the entire snippet, including full context, as provided, but resolve the conflict. So the conflict markers are between the two versions. The task is to merge them.

The original conflict is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
=======
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
                
>>>>>>> 1488b22...
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);

Wait, no. Let me look again. The code given is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
=======
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
                
>>>>>>> 1488b22...
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);

Wait, this is a bit confusing. The conflict starts with the closing } of the if (!glob...) block. Then, the HEAD version closes the else block, then has the return. The other branch adds an else clause, sets elements, returns, then closes the else block and has the same return.

But in reality, the other branch's code adds the else { ... return }, then after the else block, there's another return. That's redundant. So the correct merge would be to have the else clause with the return, and remove the return after the else block. But the user says not to modify the context if unsure, but if we can resolve the conflict.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended logic is that if the glob matches, return the iterator immediately, otherwise, proceed to the return after. But that doesn't make sense because if the glob doesn't match, it throws. So in the other branch's code, after the else clause (which handles the glob matching), they return. Then, after the else block, they return again. But since the else is part of the outer else block (the one that checks if it's a glob), if the code reaches the return after the else block, that means it wasn't a glob. Wait, no. The outer else is for when it is a glob. So the structure is:

if (condition) {
    // not a glob
} else {
    // it's a glob
    if (!globMatches) {
        throw
    } else {
        elements = ...
        return
    }
}
return ...;

Wait, no. The outer else is for when it's a glob. So in that case, inside the else block (the glob case), we check if the glob doesn't match, throw. Else (glob matches), set elements and return. Then, after the else block, there's a return. But this return is outside the outer else block, meaning it's part of the code that's executed when it's not a glob. Wait, no. The outer structure is:

if (...) {
    // not a glob
    ...
} else {
    // it's a glob
    if (!globMatches) {
        throw
    } else {
        elements = ...
        return ...
    }
}
return ...;

So the code after the else block (the return) is executed regardless of whether it was a glob or not. Wait, no. The else block is part of the outer if. So after the else block (the glob case), the code continues to the return. But in the else block (the glob case), if the glob matches, they return inside that else. If the glob doesn't match, they throw. So the code after the else block (the return) would only be reached if it's not a glob. Because if it is a glob, either it throws (if not matching) or returns (if matching). So in the non-glob case, the code would proceed to the return after the else block.

But in the other branch's code, the return after the else block is the same as the one inside the else clause. But in the non-glob case, elements would have been set in the if block (assuming that's where they are set). But the HEAD version's code has the return after the else block, which is intended for the non-glob case.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the elements variable is set in different places. Let's imagine:

In the non-glob case (the if block), elements is set. Then, after the else block (glob case), there's a return. But in the glob case, if it matches, elements is set and returned. If it doesn't match, throw. So in the non-glob case, elements is set in the if block, and then the return is executed. That makes sense.

In the other branch's code, the glob case has an else clause where elements is set and returned. Then, after the else block, there's a return for the non-glob case. That seems correct.

Wait, but in the merged code, the else clause (glob matches) would set elements and return. Then, the code after the else block returns elements for the non-glob case. So the code would look like:

if (not a glob) {
    // set elements
} else {
    // is a glob
    if (!globMatches) {
        throw
    } else {
        elements = ...
        return ...
    }
}
return new ... (elements);

So in the non-glob case, elements are set in the if block, then the return is executed. In the glob case, if matches, elements are set and returned. If not, throw. That seems correct.

Therefore, the merged code should include the else clause from the other branch (setting elements and returning), and keep the return after the else block for the non-glob case. However, in the original conflict, the other branch's code adds an extra return inside the else, which would make the code after the else block unreachable in the glob case. But that's okay because in the glob case, the else clause would have already returned. The code after is for the non-glob case.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to merge the else clause from the other branch and keep the return after the else block. The code would then correctly handle both cases: non-glob (return after), and glob (return inside else).

So the merged code would be:

        } else {
            // It might be a glob
            if (!globMatchesFiles(elem, elem.getDataStorage())) {
                throw new IOException(elem.toString() + " does not exist");
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);

But wait, in the merged code, after the else block (the glob case), there's a return statement. In the non-glob case, the if block (not shown here) would have set elements, then the code proceeds to the return. In the glob case, if the glob matches, elements are set and returned. If not, exception is thrown. Then, the return after is for the non-glob case. So this seems correct.

Therefore, the resolved code should include both the else clause from the other branch and the return statement after the else block from HEAD. Thus, the conflict is resolved by taking both changes. But in the original conflict, the HEAD's return is present in both versions. Wait, looking back, the code after the conflict markers is:

In HEAD:

            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);

In the other branch:

            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
                
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);

So the merged code would be:

        } else {
            // It might be a glob
            if (!globMatchesFiles(elem, elem.getDataStorage())) {
                throw new IOException(elem.toString() + " does not exist");
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);

But the code after the else block is the same in both. So merging the two, the conflict is resolved by adding the else clause from the other branch, and keeping the return after the else block. That way, both the glob case (handled in the else clause) and the non-glob case (handled in the if clause, then return) are covered.

Thus, the correct merged code is as above.</think>
```java
        } else {
            // It might be a glob
            if (!globMatchesFiles(elem, elem.getDataStorage())) {
                throw new IOException(elem.toString() + " does not exist");
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
```
