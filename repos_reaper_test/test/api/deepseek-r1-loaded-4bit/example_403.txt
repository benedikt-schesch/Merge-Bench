Okay, let me look at this merge conflict. The code is in Java, using a ProcessBuilder to run yt-dlp with certain arguments. The conflict is between the HEAD version and another branch's changes in the "-S" option.

In the HEAD, the arguments are "-S vcodec:h264,res:576,acodec:aac". The other branch has "-S res:576,hcodec:h264,acodec:aac". The main difference is "vcodec" vs "hcodec". 

I need to figure out what the correct parameter is for yt-dlp. The yt-dlp documentation says that the format selection uses "vcodec" and "acodec" for video and audio codecs. The "hcodec" might be a typo or a mistake because the correct parameter is "vcodec". 

Also, the comment mentions "best vcodec no better than h264", which aligns with "vcodec:h264". So the HEAD version is correct here. The other branch's "hcodec" is likely incorrect. 

Therefore, the correct line should use "vcodec:h264". So I'll keep the HEAD's version and discard the hcodec from the other branch. The rest of the parameters (res:576 and acodec:aac) are the same in both, so they can stay. 

I'll resolve the conflict by selecting the HEAD's line and ensuring the order of the parameters. Wait, the HEAD has "vcodec:h264,res:576,acodec:aac" while the other branch is "res:576,hcodec:h264,acodec:aac". Since "hcodec" is wrong, replacing it with "vcodec" from HEAD. Also, the order of parameters in the -S option might not matter, but to be safe, keeping the HEAD's order makes sense here.

So the resolved line should be "--simulate", "--dump-single-json", "-S vcodec:h264,res:576,acodec:aac", as in HEAD. The other parameters like "--no-cache-dir" etc. are the same in both, so no issues there.

Therefore, the merged code should take the HEAD's version. The conflict is resolved by choosing the correct parameter name "vcodec" instead of "hcodec".</think>
