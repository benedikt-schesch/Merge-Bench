Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The code is in Java, and there's a conflict between two changes in a try block. The HEAD version uses markReaderIndex(), skips bytes, then resets. The other branch uses ensureReadable(buf, length). 

First, I need to understand what each side is doing. The original code in HEAD marks the reader index, skips the bytes, then resets. That seems like it's checking if there are enough bytes by attempting to skip them, then resetting to the original position. Maybe ensuring that the buffer has enough readable bytes without consuming them.

The other side uses ensureReadable(buf, length). I'm not sure what that method does. If ensureReadable is a helper that checks if the buffer has at least 'length' bytes readable, then it's a cleaner approach. But if ensureReadable is not available in the current context, that would be a problem. 

Wait, the user said to resolve the conflict considering the intent of both sides. Both are trying to ensure that the buffer has enough bytes. The HEAD approach does it by temporarily skipping and resetting, which effectively checks readability. The other side uses a method that might do the same check more efficiently or cleanly.

Assuming ensureReadable is a valid method that checks if the buffer has at least 'length' bytes (maybe it's part of the HBaseRpc utilities or a library method), then using ensureReadable is better because it's more readable and avoids the mark/reset overhead. However, if ensureReadable doesn't exist, then the conflict remains.

But the user wants us to resolve if possible. The original code's approach with mark, skip, reset is a way to check if there's enough data. The ensureReadable might be a refactored version of that. So replacing the mark/skip/reset with ensureReadable would be the correct resolution, as it's likely both changes aim to validate the buffer's readable bytes, and the latter is a cleaner approach.

So the resolved code would replace the conflict lines with the ensureReadable call. That way, both intents are satisfied by ensuring the buffer has enough readable bytes. The exception handling remains the same.</think>
```java
      try {
        HBaseRpc.checkArrayLength(buf, length);
        // Make sure we have that many bytes readable.
        // This will have to change to be able to do streaming RPCs where we
        // deserialize parts of the response as it comes off the wire.
        ensureReadable(buf, length);
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        LOG.error("WTF?  RPC #" + rpcid + ": ", e);
      }
    }
