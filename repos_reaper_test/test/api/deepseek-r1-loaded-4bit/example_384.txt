Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The code snippet shows a conflict between the HEAD version and another branch. In the HEAD side, there's a line where mTextView.setTextSize is called, followed by appending a newline. The other branch, however, has an empty line between the closing brace of the else block and the setTextSize line.

First, I need to understand the intent of both changes. The HEAD version probably added the setTextSize and append("\n") lines without any extra spacing. The other branch might have introduced a formatting change, adding a blank line for readability or style purposes. Since the conflict is about whitespace, it's a matter of code style rather than functionality.

The key here is that the actual code changes (setTextSize and append) are the same in both branches. The conflict arises from the blank line. The semantic meaning isn't affected by the presence or absence of a blank line here. So, resolving this would involve keeping both changes. However, since the blank line is added in one branch and not present in the other, we need to decide whether to include it.

But wait, looking at the conflict markers: the HEAD side doesn't have the blank line, and the other branch does. To resolve, we can accept the blank line because it's a harmless formatting change. Alternatively, if the project's style guide prefers no extra blank lines, we might remove it. But without specific style guidelines, it's safer to include both changes. However, since the code after the conflict is the same in both branches (mTextView.setTextSize...), the conflict is purely about the blank line.

So the correct resolution is to remove the conflict markers and keep the blank line if it's intended. But looking at the code, the other branch adds a blank line after the else block, while HEAD does not. Merging them would result in having the blank line. Since the blank line doesn't affect functionality, and it's a minor style difference, the resolution is to keep the blank line. Therefore, the resolved code would have the blank line between the else block and the setTextSize line.</think>
```java
            mTextView.setText(mTextView.getEditableText().delete(0, mTextView.getText().toString().split("\n", 2)[0].length()+1));
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        } else {
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        }

        mTextView.setTextSize(mOptions.textSize);
        mTextView.append("\n");
    }

    @Override
