Okay, let me look at this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict between the HEAD version and the other branch. Both sides are modifying the same line where evaluator.addResult is called. 

Looking at the two versions, the HEAD version has a semicolon with some extra spaces before it, while the other branch has the semicolon with just a single space. Wait, actually, looking closer, the line in HEAD is "evaluator.addResult(result.getInstance(), result.getClassVotes());		" with two tabs or spaces after the semicolon. The other branch is "evaluator.addResult(result.getInstance(), result.getClassVotes());" without the extra spaces.

But in the context of the code, the extra whitespace after the semicolon probably doesn't affect the functionality. It's just a formatting difference. Since the intent of both branches is to call the same method with the same arguments, the conflict is trivial. The semantic meaning is the same; it's just a style difference.

So the resolution would be to pick either version, but since the conflict is about whitespace, maybe choose the one without the extra spaces for cleanliness. Alternatively, check if the project's code style prefers one over the other. But since the user didn't specify, and the main thing is that the method call is the same, merging them by taking one side or the other is safe.

Therefore, I can resolve the conflict by keeping one of the versions. Since the second version (from commit 40d31d6) has no trailing spaces, perhaps that's the intended change. So replace the conflict markers with that line.</think>
```java
		if(result.isLastEvent()){
			this.concludeMeasurement();		
			return true;
		}
		
		evaluator.addResult(result.getInstance(), result.getClassVotes());
		totalCount += 1;
		
		if(totalCount == 1){
			sampleStart = System.nanoTime();
			experimentStart = sampleStart;
