Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java test method checkNullJson(). The HEAD version has a line that calls failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown, while the other branch (a17acec) doesn't have that line. 

First, I need to understand what each side is doing. The test is annotated with expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class, which means the test will pass if that exception is thrown during its execution. In the HEAD version, after creating the Connection object, there's a call to failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown. That method is likely from a testing framework like JUnit or AssertJ, and it's used to ensure that an exception is thrown. If the exception isn't thrown, the test fails here.

But wait, the test already has the expected exception in the @Test annotation. So if the constructor of Connection throws the exception, the test should pass. If it doesn't throw, the test would fail automatically because the expected exception wasn't thrown. Adding the failBecause... line might be redundant. 

In the other branch, that line is removed. Maybe they realized that the @Test(expected) already handles the exception check, so the extra line isn't necessary. Including it could lead to a situation where if the exception is thrown, the test would pass, but if not, the fail method is called. But actually, if the exception isn't thrown, the test would fail anyway because of the @Test(expected), right? So the fail line might be redundant here.

So the conflict is about whether to include that redundant line. The HEAD version includes it, the other branch removes it. Which one is correct? Well, in JUnit, if a test method has expected exception and the exception isn't thrown, the test fails. Therefore, the fail line is redundant. The correct resolution would be to remove that line, as the other branch does. Because if the exception is thrown, the test passes; if not, JUnit automatically fails it. The fail line is unnecessary and might even cause issues if the test somehow proceeds past the constructor call without throwing, which it shouldn't.

Therefore, resolving the conflict by taking the version without the fail line (the a17acec branch) makes sense. The intent of both branches is to test that an exception is thrown. The HEAD adds an explicit fail, which is redundant. The other branch correctly relies on the @Test(expected) handling. So the correct merged code should remove the failBecause... line.</think>
```java
  }

  @Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)
  public void checkNullJson() {
    new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST), null, User.class);
  }

  @Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)
  public void checkInvalidJson() {
    new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST), "{", User.class);
