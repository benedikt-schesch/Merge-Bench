<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The code snippet is from a Java file, and the conflict is in the import statements. 

Looking at the HEAD version, they're importing newArrayList from Guava's Lists, newHashSet from Sets, and using JUnit Jupiter's Assertions.assertEquals. The other side, from commit ee24931, is importing newHashSet and JUnit 4's Assert.assertEquals, along with the Mockito imports.

First, I need to understand what each side is trying to do. The HEAD side uses JUnit 5 (Jupiter) because of the import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals. The other side is using JUnit 4's Assert class. This is a significant difference because JUnit 5 and 4 are not compatible in terms of imports. So, the user might be migrating to JUnit 5 on one branch and using JUnit 4 on the other.

Then, the HEAD also imports newArrayList from Lists, which the other side doesn't have. The other side only has newHashSet. So, if both branches are adding necessary imports, we need to combine them. However, if one branch removed an import that the other added, that's a conflict. But here, it's possible that one branch added newArrayList and the other didn't touch it, but in the conflict, the import is present in HEAD and absent in the other.

Since both sides are adding static imports, the correct resolution would be to include all necessary imports from both sides, provided they are used in the code. But wait, in the conflict, the HEAD has newArrayList, newHashSet, and JUnit 5, while the other side has newHashSet and JUnit 4. The Mockito imports are the same in both.

So, the problem is that the two branches are importing different JUnit versions and different Guava classes. The user needs to decide whether they're upgrading to JUnit 5 or staying with JUnit 4. If both are needed (unlikely), but that's a conflict. Since the user is a semantic merge expert, they need to determine if the intent is to switch to JUnit 5 or keep JUnit 4.

Alternatively, maybe the HEAD is correct because it's part of a migration, and the other branch is an older change. Or vice versa. Without more context, it's hard to tell. But since the task says to resolve based on intent and semantics, maybe we should keep both imports if possible. However, JUnit's assertEquals can't be from both versions. That's a conflict. So, the user has to choose one.

But the Mockito imports are the same, so those can stay. For the Guava imports, HEAD has newArrayList and newHashSet, while the other side has newHashSet. So combining would mean including newArrayList and newHashSet from HEAD and newHashSet from the other (but it's the same). So the combined imports would be:

import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

But wait, the other side has org.junit.Assert.assertEquals. So those two are conflicting. Since both branches are changing the same import line, this is a conflict that can't be automatically resolved without knowing which JUnit version to use. Therefore, if we can't determine the intent, we should leave the conflict. But the user might expect us to resolve it by choosing the correct one based on the surrounding context. However, in the given code snippet, the surrounding lines don't provide more info. 

Wait, looking at the package: org.infinitest. That doesn't help. The imports after the conflict include java.io.File, which is the same in both. 

So, the problem is the JUnit import. If the user is in the process of migrating to JUnit 5, then HEAD is correct. Otherwise, if the other branch is correct, then JUnit 4 is used. Since there's no way to know, the conflict remains. But maybe the correct approach is to take both imports, but that would cause a compiler error. Therefore, the merge conflict can't be resolved without more information. 

However, the task says to resolve if possible by considering the intent. The HEAD uses JUnit Jupiter (5), and the other uses JUnit 4. If both are possible, but in reality, the project would use one or the other. Maybe the HEAD is the newer change, so we should keep that. Alternatively, if the other branch is a hotfix that needs JUnit 4, but the HEAD is a feature branch using JUnit 5, that's conflicting.

Since the user is asking to resolve the conflict, and if not sure, leave it. But maybe the correct resolution is to pick the JUnit 5 version, assuming that the HEAD is the current branch and the other is an older one. Or perhaps the other way around. Without knowing, it's ambiguous. But according to the problem statement, if not sure, return the same snippet with the conflict. However, the user says to think in terms of intent and semantics. Maybe the intent is to migrate to JUnit 5, so keep the HEAD imports. Alternatively, maybe the other branch is adding a necessary change, but it's conflicting.

Wait, looking at the imports:

HEAD:
- newArrayList
- newHashSet
- JUnit5 Assertions.assertEquals

Other branch:
- newHashSet
- JUnit4 Assert.assertEquals
- same Mockito imports.

So, the newArrayList is only in HEAD. If the code uses that, then it's needed. If the other branch doesn't have it, but the code in the file requires it, then we need to keep it. If the other branch removed it, but that's not the case here. The other branch just doesn't have that import. So, perhaps the other branch is deleting the newArrayList import, but that's not the case. The conflict arises because in HEAD, there are three imports, and in the other branch, two imports (without newArrayList and with JUnit4).

So, perhaps the resolution is to take both newArrayList and newHashSet from HEAD, and then the JUnit import is conflicting. Therefore, the correct approach would be to include all necessary imports. But the JUnit imports are conflicting. Therefore, this is a conflict that can't be resolved automatically. 

But perhaps the correct resolution is to keep both JUnit imports? That's not possible, as they would clash. Therefore, the user must choose. Since the task says to resolve if possible, but if not sure, leave the conflict. However, given that the user is a semantic expert, maybe they should recognize that JUnit 5 is the newer version, and that the HEAD is likely the correct one, but the other branch might have a necessary change. However, without more context, this is a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the other branch (ee24931) is correcting the JUnit import from Jupiter to JUnit4, perhaps because the project uses JUnit4. But how can we know?

Given the ambiguity, the answer should retain the conflict. But wait, the problem says "if you are not sure... return the same snippet with the conflict". However, the initial answer here should resolve it if possible. Alternatively, perhaps both imports can be kept if the code uses both, but that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct resolution is to combine the imports, taking newArrayList from HEAD, newHashSet is present in both, and then choose between JUnit4 and JUnit5. Since we can't choose, the conflict remains. But the user might expect us to pick one. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the newArrayList import is from HEAD, and the other branch is only changing the JUnit import. So the conflict is between JUnit4 and JUnit5. If we can't resolve that, the conflict remains.

But the problem says to return the entire snippet with the conflict if unsure. But in this case, the imports from com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet are present in both, so no conflict there. The conflict is between HEAD's Lists.newArrayList and JUnit5, and the other's JUnit4. So, the newArrayList is added in HEAD, and the other branch doesn't have it, but the other branch changes the JUnit import. So the merge conflict is between those two changes.

To resolve, the correct approach would be to include both the newArrayList import and the JUnit5 import from HEAD, and also include any other changes from the other branch. Wait, but the other branch doesn't have the newArrayList import, so in the merge, if the other branch didn't touch that line, then the newArrayList would stay. But in the conflict, the lines are conflicting. So in the code, the conflict is between the two sets of imports. Therefore, the correct merge would be to take all the imports from both, but handle duplicates. 

But in the code:

HEAD has:

import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

The other branch has:

import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

So, the newHashSet is present in both. So in the merged code, we can have:

import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

But the other branch has org.junit.Assert.assertEquals, which is conflicting with HEAD's JUnit5 import. So the conflict is in the JUnit import. Therefore, the user must choose which one to keep. Since we can't know, the conflict remains. However, the Mockito imports are the same, so they can be merged without conflict.

But looking at the code as presented, the conflict markers are between the import statements. The correct resolution is to combine the imports from both branches, but resolve the JUnit conflict. However, since the JUnit imports are conflicting, this is a semantic conflict that requires manual resolution. Therefore, the answer should retain the conflict markers for the JUnit import, but perhaps merge the Guava imports.

Wait, but in the original conflict, the lines are:

<<<<<<< HEAD
import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
=======
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586

So, in the HEAD, there are three imports: newArrayList, newHashSet, and JUnit5. In the other branch, two imports: newHashSet and JUnit4.

When merging, the newArrayList is only present in HEAD. The newHashSet is present in both. The JUnit imports conflict. So, in the merged code, newArrayList should be kept, newHashSet is kept once, and the JUnit import needs to be resolved.

Therefore, the resolved imports would be:

import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
// conflict between JUnit4 and JUnit5 here.

But how to resolve the JUnit import. Since the user is a semantic expert, perhaps they should choose the one that's more recent or aligns with the project's direction. But without context, it's ambiguous.

But according to the problem statement, if unsure, return the same snippet with the conflict. However, the user says to "think in terms of intent and semantics that both sides of the merge are trying to achieve."

The intent of the HEAD is to use JUnit5 and include newArrayList. The intent of the other branch is to use JUnit4. These are conflicting intents. Therefore, this is a true conflict that cannot be resolved automatically. Hence, the conflict markers should remain.

But wait, the other branch is removing the newArrayList import? No, in the other branch's code, they don't have that line. But in the HEAD, it's added. So if the other branch was based on an older version that didn't have the newArrayList import, then merging would include the newArrayList import. But if the other branch's change is to modify the imports (remove newArrayList and change JUnit), then it's conflicting.

But in the code snippet, the other branch's code in the conflict block doesn't have the newArrayList import. So, when merging, the newArrayList line from HEAD would be added, and the newHashSet is the same. Then the JUnit line is conflicting.

But the problem is that the two branches have conflicting JUnit imports, and one adds newArrayList. Therefore, the resolved code should include newArrayList, newHashSet, and resolve the JUnit import conflict.

But since we can't resolve the JUnit import conflict automatically, the correct merge would include the conflict markers for that line.

Wait, but the original conflict is over three lines in HEAD and two in the other. So merging them would require including the newArrayList, newHashSet, and then the JUnit import conflict.

But perhaps the way to resolve is to take the newArrayList from HEAD, newHashSet (common), and then the JUnit line conflict.

But in the original code, after the merge, the imports would be:

import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
=======
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

But that's possible. However, the initial answer should return the entire snippet with resolved conflict if possible. But given that the JUnit imports are conflicting and we can't determine which to use, the conflict remains. So the answer would have the conflict markers for the JUnit import line, but the rest are merged.

Wait, but the original code snippet provided by the user includes the conflict markers up to the java.io.File line. So the code given is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
=======
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

import java.io.File;
<<<<<<< HEAD

So the Mockito imports are after the conflict, but in both branches, they are the same. Therefore, those lines are not part of the conflict. The conflict is only in the three vs. two imports. The import java.io.File is added in HEAD (with a blank line before it) and in the other branch, maybe without the blank line. Wait, in the original code, after the Mockito imports, there's a line for java.io.File, with a conflict marker in HEAD. Wait, the code as presented includes:

After the Mockito imports, in HEAD:

import java.io.File;
<<<<<<< HEAD

But the other branch's code for that line is not shown. Wait, looking back at the original code:

The user's code snippet is:

```java
 * SOFTWARE.
 */
package org.infinitest;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
=======
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

import java.io.File;
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

So, after the Mockito imports, there's an import java.io.File; line, and then a conflict marker. Wait, the <<<<<<< HEAD is after the import java.io.File; line, which suggests that in HEAD, there's an empty line after File, and in the other branch, maybe not. But the code as presented shows that after the Mockito imports, there's:

import java.io.File;
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586

But that's not part of the provided code. The code shows that after the Mockito imports and the java.io.File line, there's a conflict marker in HEAD. But the original code provided by the user has:

import java.io.File;
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

Which suggests that in HEAD, after the File import, there's a blank line, and in the other branch, perhaps not. But this part is also conflicting. So this is another conflict. Wait, the code has two conflict sections: one in the static imports, and another after the File import. 

But the user's example code shows that after the static imports (including Mockito), there's the line:

import java.io.File;

Then another conflict marker:

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586

But in the original code, it's:

import java.io.File;
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

So in HEAD, there's a blank line after the File import, and in the other branch, maybe there's no blank line. So this is a formatting conflict. But the user's instruction says to preserve spacing as is. However, the task is to resolve the conflict. For the first conflict (imports), we need to resolve that. For the second conflict (after java.io.File), it's about a blank line. If HEAD has a blank line and the other branch doesn't, that's a trivial conflict. But in this case, the user's code shows that after the File import, there's a conflict marker. So the entire code has two separate conflicts.

But the user's instruction is to return the entire snippet with resolved conflicts. So need to handle both.

But focusing first on the static imports. Let's resolve that. Then, the File import conflict.

So for the static imports:

HEAD has:

import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

Other branch has:

import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

The common import is newHashSet. The newArrayList is only in HEAD, and the JUnit imports are conflicting. So the merged static imports should include newArrayList, newHashSet, and resolve the JUnit import. Since we can't resolve JUnit automatically, we leave that conflict. However, the Mockito imports are the same in both, so they are not part of the conflict.

Then, after resolving the static imports, the code has:

import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
=======
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

But wait, the Mockito imports are after the conflict, so they are common to both branches. Therefore, they should remain as is. So the merged static imports would be the three lines from HEAD (including newArrayList and newHashSet and JUnit5) conflicting with the two lines from the other branch (newHashSet and JUnit4). But since newHashSet is present in both, we can keep it once. So the merged static imports would be:

import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
=======
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586

Then the Mockito imports follow. So this part would have the conflict remaining for the JUnit import.

Then, the java.io.File line and the subsequent conflict. In HEAD, after importing File, there's a blank line. In the other branch, perhaps not. But in the code provided, after the File import, there's a conflict marker. So the line is:

import java.io.File;
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======

>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586

So the conflict is about whether to have a blank line after the File import. Since it's a whitespace conflict, but the user says to preserve spacing, but resolve the conflict. The correct approach is to take one of them. If HEAD has a blank line and the other doesn't, but the code's style is to have a blank line, that's up to the project's style. Without context, it's hard to say. But since the user says to preserve spacing, but resolve the conflict, maybe take HEAD's version (the blank line). But since it's a conflict, the resolution would be to keep the blank line from HEAD and discard the other's. So the merged code would have:

import java.io.File;

But if the other branch had no blank line, merging would result in the blank line being kept. However, since the conflict is only about the presence of the blank line, and the user's instruction is to preserve spacing as is, but resolve the conflict, perhaps we should take both changes. But that's impossible. So the conflict here is trivial, but since it's part of the code snippet, we have to resolve it.

But how to resolve this? If the user is following a certain code style, perhaps the blank line is intentional. However, without knowing, the safest way is to keep the blank line from HEAD. So the resolved line is:

import java.io.File;

With a blank line after.

Putting it all together, the resolved code snippet would be:

package org.infinitest;

import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
=======
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

import java.io.File;

But wait, the conflict in the static imports is still present. The other conflict after File is resolved by taking HEAD's blank line.

But according to the problem statement, if not sure, return the same snippet with the conflict. However, in this case, the JUnit import is conflicting, and the rest can be merged. So the final answer should include the conflict markers for the JUnit import, but merge the rest.

Therefore, the final resolved code would have the newArrayList import from HEAD, newHashSet from both (merged once), and the JUnit import conflicting. The Mockito imports are merged. The java.io.File import is followed by a blank line from HEAD.

So the final answer would be:
