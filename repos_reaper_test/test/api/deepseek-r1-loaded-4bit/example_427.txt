Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java imports section. The HEAD version has some imports, and the other branch (971b995) adds AsyncTask and TMDbClient.

First, I need to figure out the intent of both changes. The HEAD side doesn't have the AsyncTask and TMDbClient imports, while the other branch adds them. Since these are imports, they might be necessary for the code to compile if those classes are used elsewhere in the file.

Looking at the surrounding context, the package declaration is correct. The conflict is between the imports. The task is part of a class that might be using AsyncTask (which is an Android class) and TMDbClient, which is from the project's own package.

The original code from HEAD might have removed those imports, or the other branch added them. But since the conflict is in adding them, the correct resolution is to include both imports. Because in merge conflicts, both sides' changes should be considered. However, since the two sides are modifying different parts (HEAD might have some imports, and the other branch adds new ones), the correct approach is to combine both.

Wait, but looking at the code, the HEAD side doesn't have those two lines, and the other branch adds them. So in the conflict markers, the HEAD is the top part, and the other branch is adding the two imports. So to resolve, we should take both. But wait, the conflict is between the lines after the package declaration. The HEAD version has nothing there, and the other branch adds those two imports. Wait no, looking again:

The code snippet shows:

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import android.os.AsyncTask;

import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.api.TMDbClient;
>>>>>>> 971b9954a7a2b57c88112a78a07f3c750d7d8e14

So the HEAD side (current branch) doesn't have those imports, and the other branch adds them. But in the code after the conflict, the existing imports are from both sides. Wait, no: the code after the conflict markers includes the lines from both branches. Wait, the original code after the package statement is:

In HEAD, after the package line, it goes straight to the existing imports (like TaskListener, Config, etc.), while the other branch adds the two new imports (AsyncTask and TMDbClient) before the existing ones.

So the conflict is between the lines after the package statement. The HEAD doesn't have the two new imports, and the other branch adds them. Therefore, to resolve, we should include both imports. So the correct merged code would include the AsyncTask and TMDbClient imports from the other branch, along with the existing imports from HEAD.

But wait, the existing imports from HEAD are present in both versions? Because in the code snippet, after the conflict markers, the existing imports (TaskListener, Config, VideoUtils, ListUtils) are present. So the conflict is about adding two new imports in the other branch. Therefore, the correct resolution is to include those two imports from the other branch, and keep the existing imports from both. Since there's no overlap in the import lines, the conflict can be resolved by taking both sides' changes.

Therefore, the resolved code should have the two new imports added by the other branch, followed by the existing imports from HEAD. The order might matter, but since both are separate imports, combining them should be fine.

So the merged code would have:

import android.os.AsyncTask;
import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.api.TMDbClient;
import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.listeners.TaskListener;
... and so on.

But looking at the code structure, the existing imports are already present after the conflict. Wait, the code as shown is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import android.os.AsyncTask;

import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.api.TMDbClient;
>>>>>>> 971b9954a7a2b57c88112a78a07f3c750d7d8e14
import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.listeners.TaskListener;
import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.model.tmdb.Config;
import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.util.VideoUtils;

import org.apache.commons.collections4.ListUtils;

So the HEAD version (top part) has no lines between the package and the existing imports. The other branch adds two imports (AsyncTask and TMDbClient) between the package and the existing imports.

Therefore, the conflict is between adding those two imports (other branch) vs. not having them (HEAD). If the code in the other branch is correct, then we need to include those imports. If the HEAD removed them, but they are needed, that's a problem.

Assuming that both changes are valid, the correct resolution is to keep both imports. Therefore, the merged code should include the two new imports from the other branch, followed by the existing imports.

So the resolved code would have the package line, then the two new imports, then the rest.

But looking at the code structure, there's an empty line after the AsyncTask import. So in the other branch's code, it's:

import android.os.AsyncTask;

import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.api.TMDbClient;

Which has a blank line between them. Then the existing imports follow. So the merged code would have those two imports added, then the existing ones.

So the resolved code snippet would be:

package com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.task;

import android.os.AsyncTask;

import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.api.TMDbClient;
import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.listeners.TaskListener;
import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.model.tmdb.Config;
import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.util.VideoUtils;

import org.apache.commons.collections4.ListUtils;

That's the correct merge. So the conflict markers are removed, and the two imports from the other branch are added, followed by the existing ones. Since there's no overlap, this should resolve without issues.</think>
