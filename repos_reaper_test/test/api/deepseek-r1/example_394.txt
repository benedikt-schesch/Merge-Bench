Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. So, looking at the code snippet provided, there's a conflict in the test method. The HEAD version has the method declared as `void shouldUpdateCoreOnAutoBuild()` with the `@Test` annotation, while the other branch (ee24931) uses `public void shouldUpdateCoreOnAutoBuild()`. Also, there's a difference in the method name `prepateCore` vs `prepareCore`â€”looks like a typo in HEAD.

First, in JUnit 5 (Jupiter), test methods don't need to be public, so the `public` modifier is optional. The HEAD version is using the more modern JUnit 5 style without `public`, which is correct. However, the other branch might be using JUnit 4, where test methods need to be public. But since the `@Test` annotation here is probably from JUnit 5 (as it's `@Test` without any import conflicts), keeping the method non-public makes sense. So we should go with the HEAD's version without `public`.

Next, the method name `prepateCore` in HEAD is a typo. The correct method name is `prepareCore`, as seen in the other branch. That's a clear mistake, so we should correct that to `prepareCore`.

So the resolved code should have the method without `public` and the correct method name. Let me check the surrounding context. The verify calls and assertions seem consistent on both sides. The parameters passed to `prepareCore` are the same. The rest of the code after the conflict markers is the same in both branches, so no issues there.

Therefore, the resolved code will merge the method declaration from HEAD (without `public`), correct the typo in the method call to `prepareCore`, and keep the rest as is. The surrounding context like the `assertEquals` and `verify` calls remain unchanged because there's no conflict there.</think>
```java
		assertEquals(1, updates);
		verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));
	}

	@Test
	void shouldUpdateCoreOnAutoBuild() throws CoreException {
		InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 10);

		workspace.updateProjects(Collections.singleton(resource));

		assertStatusIs(findingTests(0, projects.size(), 0));
		verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));
```
