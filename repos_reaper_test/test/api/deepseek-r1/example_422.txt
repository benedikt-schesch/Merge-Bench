Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java imports. Let's look at what's happening here. The HEAD version is importing JBakeProperty from org.jbake.app.configuration, while the other branch is importing DocumentModel from org.jbake.model. 

First, I should check if these imports are both necessary. JBakeProperty might be used somewhere in the class, and DocumentModel could also be needed. Since they're in different packages, maybe both are required. 

Looking at the surrounding code, the class is part of the model package and deals with DocumentTypes and ModelExtractor. DocumentModel is part of the model package, so it's likely used here. On the other hand, JBakeProperty is related to configuration, which might be used for properties or settings.

I should verify if both imports are actually used in the code. If the conflict is because both branches added different imports, the correct resolution is to keep both. So, the merged code should include both imports: JBakeProperty and DocumentModel. 

Therefore, the resolved snippet will have both import statements without any conflict markers. I'll remove the conflict markers and keep both imports in the correct order, probably alphabetical or as per the original structure. Since the HEAD import comes first in the original conflict, I'll list JBakeProperty first, then DocumentModel.</think>
```java
package org.jbake.template.model;

import org.jbake.app.ContentStore;
import org.jbake.app.DocumentList;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes;
import org.jbake.template.ModelExtractor;

import java.util.Map;
