Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The conflict is in the JavaDoc comment of the openDFSFile method. The HEAD version has a comment saying the function is for accessing HDFS files, while the other branch adds parameters and return documentation.

First, I need to understand what each side is doing. The HEAD's comment explains the purpose of the function. The other branch adds specific Javadoc tags: @param fileName, @return, and @throws IOException. These are important for documentation, providing details on parameters, return values, and exceptions.

The goal is to merge both intents. The function's purpose from HEAD should stay, and the added tags from the other branch should be included. There's no overlap except the comment lines. So combining both makes sense. The second line from the other branch can be appended after the first line from HEAD. That way, the comment includes both the general purpose and the specific documentation tags.

Check the syntax. The Javadoc should start with the general description, then the tags. So the merged comment would have the first line from HEAD, then the second line from the other branch, followed by the tags. Wait, looking at the conflict markers: HEAD's comment is two lines, but in the code, it's written as a single line. The other branch's comment is a single line plus the tags. So merging them would involve taking the HEAD's first line, then the other branch's line, but wait, maybe the other branch's line is a continuation. Wait, looking at the actual code:

HEAD has:
/**
 * This function is meant to be used if the mappers/reducers want to access
 * any HDFS file

The other branch has:
/**
 * This function is meant to be used if the mappers/reducers want to access any HDFS file
 * @param fileName
 * @return InputStream of the open file.
 * @throws IOException

So the HEAD version splits the comment into two lines, while the other branch combines it into one line and adds the tags. The conflict is between the two comment styles and the addition of tags.

The correct resolution is to take the combined comment line from the other branch (since it's more concise) and include the Javadoc tags. Alternatively, perhaps the HEAD's two-line comment can be kept along with the tags. Wait, but the other branch's change is modifying the comment to be a single line and adding the tags. So the conflict arises because HEAD has a comment split into two lines, and the other branch modified it to a single line and added tags.

To resolve, we should take the single-line comment from the other branch (since it's a modification) and include the tags. That way, the comment is concise and the tags are added. So the merged Javadoc would be:

/**
 * This function is meant to be used if the mappers/reducers want to access any HDFS file
 * @param fileName
 * @return InputStream of the open file.
 * @throws IOException
 */

Thus, the conflict is resolved by taking the other branch's version of the comment and the tags. The HEAD's version had the same content but split into two lines, but the other branch combined it and added documentation. Since the intent is to add the Javadoc tags, which are missing in HEAD, merging the other branch's changes makes sense. However, we need to ensure that the comment is correctly formatted. The other branch's comment line is a single line, which is acceptable. Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the other branch's comment and the tags, resolving the conflict by removing the conflict markers and combining both changes.</think>
