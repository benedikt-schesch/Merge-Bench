Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code in question is creating a GruntParser object. The HEAD version uses a constructor with a StringReader, while the other branch uses a constructor that also includes myPig as a second argument.

First, I need to figure out what each side is doing. The HEAD version might be an older version of the code, and the other branch is adding a new parameter to the constructor. Maybe the GruntParser class was updated to require a Pig instance as well. Or perhaps the second parameter is optional in some contexts.

I should check if the myPig variable is declared and initialized in the surrounding code. If it's present, then the correct resolution is to include both arguments. If not, maybe there's a mistake. But since the user provided the code snippet, I can assume that myPig exists in that context.

The intent here is likely that the second branch updated the constructor to include a necessary parameter, so merging both by using the two-argument constructor makes sense. The HEAD version might be missing that parameter, leading to potential errors. Therefore, resolving the conflict by choosing the version with myPig is correct.</think>
```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "describe b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
``` 

Rationale: The conflict appears to be about different constructor signatures for GruntParser. The semantic intent from both branches is to create a GruntParser with appropriate configuration:
- HEAD branch shows basic initialization with script reader
- Other branch adds a myPig parameter which likely provides important Pig context

The resolution keeps the myPig parameter since it appears to be a necessary dependency injection that was added in a later commit (as indicated by the commit message pattern), while maintaining the existing script reader parameter. The comma placement and closing parenthesis are adjusted to maintain valid Java syntax.
