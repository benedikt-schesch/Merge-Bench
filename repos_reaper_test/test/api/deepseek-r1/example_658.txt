Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. So the code is in Java, and there's a conflict between the HEAD version and another branch. The conflict is around two versions of the executePost method.

In the HEAD side, there's an override of executePost with parameters (url, headers, parameters, binaryAttachments). Then in the other branch (3e88fb2), that method is removed. So the conflict is that one side added a new method overload with headers, and the other side maybe removed it or didn't have it.

But wait, looking at the context, the HEAD has two methods: the first one is executePost with url, parameters, and binaryAttachments. Then there's another overload with headers added. The other branch (the one being merged) doesn't have that second overload. So the conflict arises because the HEAD added a new method, and the other branch might have removed it or never had it.

Wait, no. The conflict markers show that in HEAD, there's the second method, and in the other branch (3e88fb2), that method is removed. So when merging, the question is whether to keep the method added in HEAD or remove it as per the other branch.

But why would the other branch remove it? Maybe the other branch was based on an older version where that method didn't exist. So during merging, Git can't decide whether to keep the addition from HEAD or delete it as per the other branch.

To resolve this, we need to consider the intent. The HEAD added an overload with headers, which is a valid method overloading. The other branch doesn't have this method. If the intention is to keep both methods (the original and the one with headers), then we should keep the HEAD version. If the other branch intentionally removed that method, but that's unlikely because the other branch's code is just deleting it in the conflict.

But since the user says to think in terms of intent and semantics of both sides, maybe both changes are valid. The HEAD added a new overload, and the other branch didn't touch that part. Wait, the conflict is that the HEAD added the method, and the other branch has nothing there. So when merging, the correct resolution is to keep the HEAD's addition. Because the other branch didn't modify that part; perhaps the code in the other branch was from before the method was added. So the merge should retain both methods.

Therefore, the resolved code should include both executePost methods. The conflict occurs because the other branch's version doesn't have the second method, but in reality, the HEAD added it. So the correct resolution is to keep both methods, thus resolving the conflict by accepting the HEAD's changes and discarding the deletion from the other branch.

So the resolved code would have both methods. Therefore, the merged code should include both @Override methods. The conflict markers are removed, and both methods are kept.</think>
