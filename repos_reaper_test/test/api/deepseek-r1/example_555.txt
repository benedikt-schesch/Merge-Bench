Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the method signature of convertSampleAccordingToMediaType. The HEAD version has the first parameter as Map<String, Object> content, while the other branch uses Object content. 

I need to figure out the intent of both changes. Maybe the HEAD version is expecting a map, perhaps for structured data, while the other branch is making it more general by accepting any Object. 

Looking at the method's usage, the code inside the method uses 'content' as a parameter. The method checks if the media type is supported, then probably processes the content. If the method was changed to accept Object, it might be to handle different types of content, not just maps. But if the HEAD changed it to Map, maybe there was a reason, like needing to process key-value pairs.

Wait, the method's name is convertSampleAccordingToMediaType. So it's about converting a sample based on media type. The media type could determine how the content is structured. For example, JSON might be a map, while other types might be different objects.

But the method's implementation after the parameters doesn't immediately use the content variable. It creates a MetadataService, gets the media type, checks supported extensions. The actual processing of content might be elsewhere, but the parameter type affects how it's handled.

If one branch generalizes the content to Object, and the other specializes it to Map, that's a conflict. To resolve this, I need to determine which change is more appropriate. Alternatively, maybe the method can be modified to accept Object, as that's more flexible. If the HEAD change was part of a refactor that requires a Map, but the other branch's change is for broader use, perhaps the Object is better.

But without more context, it's risky. However, in Java, using Object is more generic. If the method's implementation can handle any Object, then using Object as the parameter type would be better. But if the method's logic relies on the content being a Map, then the Map type is necessary.

Looking at the code after the parameters: the content is not used in the provided snippet. The code checks the media type's extension. Maybe later, the content is processed, perhaps serialized. If the method is supposed to handle different data structures, using Object makes sense. For example, if the content is a String, a Map, or another type, the method can convert it according to the media type.

So the intent of changing the parameter to Object might be to allow more flexibility, whereas changing it to Map could be a specific use case. But without seeing the rest of the method, it's hard to tell. However, in merge conflicts, sometimes the correct approach is to take the most recent change or the one that doesn't break existing functionality.

Alternatively, maybe both changes are compatible. Wait, the HEAD is changing the parameter from Object to Map, and the other branch is keeping it as Object? Or vice versa? Let me check again.

HEAD version has Map<String, Object> content, while the other branch has Object content. So in the HEAD, someone changed the parameter to be a Map, perhaps because the method now requires it. In the other branch, the parameter is Object. If the method in the other branch was originally using Object, and HEAD changed it to Map, merging these would require deciding which one is correct.

If both changes are meant to coexist, that's impossible. So the resolution would be to pick one or the other, or find a way to make them compatible. But since the method signatures are conflicting, we can't have both. 

The correct resolution depends on which change is necessary. If the method in the HEAD branch now requires a Map (e.g., it's using methods specific to Map), then keeping the Map is necessary. If the other branch's change to Object is to allow more general content, but the HEAD's change is a refactor, perhaps the HEAD's version is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the other branch's change is a bug fix, and the HEAD's change is a feature. But without context, it's hard. 

In such cases, perhaps the best approach is to accept the most recent change or the one that's more specific. But since I don't have the commit history, I have to make a semantic decision.

If the method can work with both types, perhaps changing it to Object is better for compatibility. But if the method now in HEAD requires a Map (e.g., it's doing content.get(...) or something), then it needs to be a Map.

But in the provided code snippet, the content parameter is not used. The code after the parameters uses mediaTypeAsString and representationName, but not content. So maybe the content is used later in the method, beyond the provided snippet.

Assuming that the method's logic in the HEAD requires a Map, then the parameter should be Map. If the other branch's change was to generalize it, but the HEAD's code now depends on it being a Map, then the HEAD version is correct.

Alternatively, if the other branch's change is part of a broader refactor where content is passed as Object, then that's necessary.

Since the user asked to resolve based on intent and semantics, and if both changes are valid but conflicting, but in reality, one change is more correct.

Alternatively, maybe the method was originally using Object, and HEAD changed it to Map, while the other branch made some other change that's compatible. But in the conflict here, the parameter type is the issue.

Given that, perhaps the correct resolution is to keep the parameter as Object, since changing it to Map would restrict the method's usability unless necessary. But if the method's implementation (not shown) requires a Map, then it should be Map.

But without seeing the full method, it's a guess. However, the user wants a resolution based on the provided snippet.

In the provided code, after the method signature, the content is not used. So maybe the parameter type change is unrelated to the code shown. Therefore, perhaps the conflict can be resolved by choosing one or the other. But which one?

Alternatively, perhaps the method is being overloaded. But the conflict is in the same method.

Another angle: in Java, if the method's parameter is changed from Object to Map in one branch, and another branch adds a new parameter or changes another part, but here both are changing the same parameter.

The correct resolution is to determine which change is more appropriate. If both branches made changes to the parameter type, but for different reasons, we need to see which one to keep.

Assuming that the intent of the HEAD change is to enforce that content is a Map, perhaps for type safety, while the other branch wants to accept any Object, perhaps for flexibility.

If the method's logic works with Object, then the other branch's version is better. But if the method now requires a Map (as per HEAD), then that's necessary.

Given that the user is asking to resolve based on intent and semantics, and if we can't determine, we should leave the conflict. But the user says to resolve if possible.

Alternatively, maybe the two changes can be merged by making the parameter type Object, as it's a supertype of Map. So if the HEAD's change to Map was a mistake, or the other branch's change to Object is more general, perhaps Object is the right choice.

But without knowing which branch is correct, it's a guess. But perhaps the HEAD is a newer change, so maybe it's intended. However, the user hasn't provided that context.

In the absence of clear intent, it's safer to keep both changes, but that's impossible. So the conflict remains. But the user wants a resolution if possible.

Alternatively, maybe the method can be modified to accept Object, and then within the method, check if it's a Map. But that's changing the code beyond what's provided.

But the user says to return the resolved code if possible, otherwise keep the conflict.

Since the parameter types are conflicting and there's no way to know which is correct without more context, perhaps the best answer is to keep the conflict. However, the user might expect an attempted resolution.

Alternatively, perhaps the method in HEAD is part of a refactoring where content must be a Map, and the other branch is an older change. But it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the parameter type in the other branch (Object) is correct because the method is supposed to handle different types, and the HEAD change was a mistake.

But again, without more context, it's hard.

Given that, perhaps the safest resolution is to accept the Object type, as it's more general, unless the method requires a Map. Since the code provided doesn't use the content variable, perhaps the Object is acceptable.

Therefore, resolving the conflict by choosing the Object version.</think>
