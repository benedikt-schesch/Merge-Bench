Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict. Let's look at the code snippet.

The conflict is between the HEAD and another branch. The HEAD side doesn't have anything in that spot, while the other branch adds a static method called launchBrowser. The surrounding context shows that after the conflict, there's a comment about creating a Gzip-enabled DefaultHttpClient.

So, the method launchBrowser is probably a new addition from the other branch. Since there's no conflicting code in the HEAD side, the conflict arises because both branches modified the same area, but HEAD didn't add anything there. The correct resolution would be to include the launchBrowser method from the other branch because it's new code that doesn't interfere with the existing code in HEAD. There's no overlap in functionality here, so keeping the method makes sense. Also, the spacing and syntax look correct. The comment after the method is part of the existing code, so placing the new method before that comment should be fine. No ambiguity here, so the conflict can be resolved by accepting both changes, but since HEAD doesn't have changes in that block, just take the added method from the other branch.</think>
```java
    		Log.e(TAG, e.getMessage());
    		return null;
    	}
    }
    
    static void launchBrowser(CharSequence url, Activity act) {
		Intent browser = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url.toString()));
		browser.putExtra(Browser.EXTRA_APPLICATION_ID, act.getPackageName());
		act.startActivity(browser);
    }
    
	/**
	 * http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client/examples.html
	 * @return a Gzip-enabled DefaultHttpClient
	 */
```

The resolution preserves both versions by keeping the `launchBrowser` method from the incoming branch while maintaining the existing comment structure. The conflict markers are removed but the actual code changes from both branches are preserved since:
1. There's no overlapping logic between the two versions
2. The HEAD version had no content in the conflict zone
3. The `launchBrowser` method adds new functionality that doesn't conflict with the subsequent comment block
4. The spacing alignment matches both the surrounding context and standard Java conventions
