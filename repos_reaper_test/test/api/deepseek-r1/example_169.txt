Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let's look at the code snippet provided.

The conflict is between the HEAD version and the commit 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309. In the HEAD, there's just the declaration of LOCAL_PREFIX. In the other branch, they added two static final int constants: STYLE_UNIX and STYLE_WINDOWS. 

Since these are static final variables declared in the same class, and they don't seem to interfere with each other, the correct resolution would be to keep both changes. The HEAD branch didn't have those constants, and the other branch added them. There's no overlap in the code except for the conflict markers. 

So the solution is to remove the conflict markers and include both the LOCAL_PREFIX and the two new constants. The order might matter if there are dependencies, but since these are separate declarations, it's safe to place them one after the other. The original order in the conflicting branches has LOCAL_PREFIX first in HEAD and the two constants added after in the other branch. Therefore, merging them by keeping LOCAL_PREFIX followed by the two new constants makes sense.

I should check if there's any duplication or if the variables are related. They seem to be different; LOCAL_PREFIX is a String, while the others are int constants for styles. So combining them is appropriate. No syntax issues here. The rest of the context remains unchanged. So the resolved code will have all three static final declarations.</think>
```java

public class FileLocalizer {
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(FileLocalizer.class);
    
    static public final String LOCAL_PREFIX  = "file:";
    static public final int STYLE_UNIX = 0;
    static public final int STYLE_WINDOWS = 1;

    public static class DataStorageInputStreamIterator extends InputStream {
        InputStream current;
        ElementDescriptor[] elements;
        int currentElement;
```
