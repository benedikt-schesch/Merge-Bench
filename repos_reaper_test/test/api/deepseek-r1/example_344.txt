Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code snippet shows a conflict between the HEAD commit and another commit (fe1b8ab28f...). The conflicting part is the spacing between the return statement and the catch blocks.

In the HEAD version, there's a single blank line after "return ret;". In the other branch, there are two blank lines with some extra whitespace. The rest of the code around the conflict seems the same.

The goal here is to resolve the spacing conflict. Since both sides are just adding blank lines but in different quantities, I need to decide which one to keep. However, the user mentioned to think about the intent and semantics. Both changes don't affect functionality; they're just formatting. 

But in merge conflicts, if both changes are whitespace, it's often safe to pick one, but maybe the correct approach is to preserve the spacing from both or find a compromise. Wait, but the user says if unsure, leave the conflict. But in this case, maybe the correct resolution is to take one of the versions. 

Wait, looking again: HEAD has one blank line, the other branch has two blank lines with possible trailing spaces (because of the extra tabs). But in Java, blank lines between statements are just stylistic. The semantic intent here is the same: add some space before the catch block. 

Since the conflict is purely about the number of blank lines, and there's no semantic difference, the resolver might choose either. However, the user wants us to resolve it if we can determine intent. Since both are just adding whitespace, maybe the correct resolution is to take the version with one blank line (HEAD) because it's simpler, but the other side adds more. Alternatively, maybe the two newlines in the other branch are intentional, but without more context, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the conflict is because one side added a line and the other didn't. Wait, in the HEAD, after "return ret;" there's a single line, then the closing brace. In the other branch, there are two blank lines. But the code structure is the same. 

The merge conflict markers are between the return statement and the closing brace of the try block. The code after the conflict is the catch blocks. So the lines in conflict are the blank lines between the return and the closing } of the try block.

Wait, looking at the code:

The HEAD has:

			return ret;
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
			
			
>>>>>>> fe1b8ab28f6b9e6d70825a39c04c0384351cd5a8
		} catch (MalformedURLException e) {

So in HEAD, after return ret; there's a single blank line, then the closing } of the try block. In the other branch, there are two blank lines, each with some tabs (since the lines have "			" which are tabs). But the actual code structure is the same. The difference is just the number of blank lines and possible whitespace.

Since both changes are whitespace, and without more context on which is preferred, the safe resolution would be to pick one. However, the user said if unsure, leave the conflict. But maybe the correct resolution is to take both, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe one of the branches added those lines for a reason, like aligning with other code style. 

But since the user wants us to resolve based on intent and semantics, and if not sure, leave the conflict. In this case, the conflict is purely about whitespace, which doesn't affect the program's execution. So perhaps the resolution is to accept one of the versions. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the original code had a certain style, and one branch added an extra line. But without more context, it's hard. The resolver might choose to keep one blank line (HEAD) or two. But since the user's instruction is to resolve if possible, perhaps the best way is to pick the version with one blank line, as it's the HEAD, which is the current branch. Alternatively, maybe the other branch's two lines are intentional, but it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the conflict is because one side added a line and the other didn't. But given that both are just blank lines, perhaps the resolver can choose either. But the user might want to keep both? No, that's not possible. So perhaps the correct approach is to remove the conflict markers and keep one of the versions. Since the conflict is trivial, maybe just pick the HEAD version, which has one blank line. Or maybe the other version. But without knowing the project's coding style, it's hard.

But according to the user's instructions: "If you are not sure on how to resolve the conflict or if the intent is ambiguous, please return the same snippet with the conflict." So if the intent is ambiguous, leave it as is.

In this case, the intent is purely about code formatting (whitespace), so the intent is the same. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by choosing either version. Since the HEAD has one line and the other has two, but the user might prefer the HEAD's version. Alternatively, maybe the correct resolution is to take the version with two lines but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the two lines in the other branch are accidental (extra whitespace), but the HEAD's single line is correct. Or vice versa.

Since the user hasn't provided any context beyond the snippet, perhaps the best approach is to resolve the conflict by keeping the HEAD's version (one blank line), as it's the current branch. But the other branch's extra lines could be intentional. However, since both are just whitespace changes, and there's no semantic difference, the conflict can be resolved by taking either. But the user might expect us to merge them by taking one.

Alternatively, maybe the correct resolution is to have one blank line, so the merged code would have:

			return ret;

		} catch...

But in the conflicting part, the HEAD has one line, and the other has two. So the resolver needs to pick one. However, since the user's instruction is to resolve if possible, but if unsure, leave the conflict. So if I'm not sure, leave it. But in this case, the conflict is purely about whitespace, which doesn't affect functionality. Therefore, the resolver can safely choose either. However, since the user wants to resolve based on intent and semantics, and if the intent is the same (which it is here), then perhaps the conflict can be resolved by choosing the version that's more consistent with the rest of the code.

But without seeing the rest of the code, it's impossible to know the project's style. So in this case, perhaps the safest resolution is to take the HEAD's version (one blank line) and discard the other. Therefore, the resolved code would have a single blank line. Alternatively, take the other branch's two lines.

But given that the user's example shows that the other branch has two lines with more whitespace (maybe trailing spaces?), perhaps the correct approach is to take the HEAD's version. So, the resolved code would have the single blank line, and the conflict markers removed.

Therefore, the merged code would be:

			return ret;

		} catch (MalformedURLException e) {

But I need to make sure the spacing is preserved as per the original. Wait, the HEAD version has a single blank line (with no indentation?), while the other has two lines with possible indentation. Let me check the original code again.

Original conflict:

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
			
			
>>>>>>> fe1b8ab28f6b9e6d70825a39c04c0384351cd5a8

In the HEAD, the line after return ret; is a blank line (with maybe no leading tabs?), and the other branch has two lines, each with leading tabs (since the code is indented with tabs). Wait, looking at the surrounding code, the lines are indented with tabs. For example:

			jp.setCodec(mapper);
			final JsonNode ret = jp.readValueAs(JsonNode.class);
			Log.v("Connection", "Command " + command + ": " + data.toString());
			Log.v("Connection", ret.toString());
			return ret;
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
			
			
>>>>>>> fe1b8ab28f6b9e6d70825a39c04c0384351cd5a8
		} catch (MalformedURLException e) {

The lines after return ret; in the HEAD are a blank line (without any tabs?), while the other branch has two lines each with "			" which is four spaces or a tab? Assuming that the code uses tabs for indentation, the lines in the conflict would be:

In HEAD: a blank line (no tabs)
In the other branch: two lines with tabs (maybe same as the surrounding code's indentation level?)

But in Java, it's common to have closing braces at the same indentation level as the try. For example, the try block is inside a method, which is indented. The line after return ret; would be the closing } of the try block. So perhaps the blank lines between return ret; and the closing } should be indented or not.

Wait, looking at the code structure:

The code is inside a try block. The return ret; is inside the try. Then the try closes with }, followed by catch blocks.

In the code, the line after return ret; is the closing }, which is at the same indentation level as the try. So between return ret; and }, there might be blank lines. But those blank lines, if any, should not have any indentation. However, in the conflicting code:

HEAD has a blank line (no indentation), while the other branch has two lines with "			" (tabs or spaces). If the code is properly formatted, the blank lines between the return and the closing } should not have any leading whitespace. So the HEAD's blank line is correct, while the other branch's lines with leading tabs are incorrect. Therefore, the correct resolution would be to take the HEAD's version.

But why does the other branch have two lines with leading tabs? It might be a mistake. So resolving the conflict by keeping the HEAD's single blank line without leading tabs is the correct approach.

Therefore, the resolved code would remove the conflict markers and keep the HEAD's blank line.</think>
