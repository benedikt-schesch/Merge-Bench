<think>
Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code snippet. Let me look at what's going on here.

The conflict is between the HEAD version and the commit 01a6cc5. The HEAD version has a paragraph that starts with "If there is no declared field..." and includes a closing </p> tag. The other side (from commit 01a6cc5) seems to remove that entire block. Wait, no—the conflict markers show that the HEAD version adds that paragraph, and the other side doesn't have it. Wait, actually, looking at the code snippet, the <<<<<<< HEAD block includes that paragraph, and the ======= block is just removing it. So the conflict is that one side added that paragraph and the other side didn't. 

But wait, maybe the other side has a different version. Let me check the context. The paragraph in HEAD talks about handling when there's no declared field, and if the data is a Map, storing the parameter as a string or ArrayList. The other side (the commit 01a6cc5) doesn't have that paragraph. But maybe the other side has a different version of the documentation. Or perhaps the paragraph was added in HEAD and removed in the other branch. 

Wait, the code after the conflict markers in the other side is just the closing </p> tag. Wait, no—the conflict is that the HEAD version has the paragraph, and the other side (the one from commit 01a6cc5) deletes that paragraph. So the conflict is whether to include that paragraph or not.

But looking at the content, both versions might actually be trying to document the same thing. Wait, the HEAD version's paragraph says: "If there is no declared field... unless the input data parameter is a Map. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored as a string or ArrayList..." The other side's version (after ====) doesn't have that. But wait, in the code provided, the conflict is that the HEAD adds that paragraph and the other side removes it. So the question is whether to keep that paragraph or not.

But perhaps there's a merge conflict because both sides modified the same area. Wait, maybe the other side had a different version of the documentation. Let me check the surrounding lines. The paragraph before the conflict is about declared fields of type Collection. Then in HEAD, there's an additional paragraph about handling when there's no declared field, and if the data is a Map. The other side doesn't have that paragraph. So the conflict is that one side added this explanation, and the other side didn't. 

To resolve this, I need to determine if the paragraph from HEAD is necessary or if it's redundant. But the user says to think in terms of intent and semantics. Both sides might be trying to document the behavior. Maybe the paragraph in HEAD is an addition that clarifies what happens when there's no declared field, which the other side didn't have. Alternatively, maybe the other side's version removed it because it was moved elsewhere or considered redundant.

But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, looking at the content, the paragraph in HEAD seems to add important information: explaining that if the data is a Map, the parameters are stored as strings or ArrayLists. The other side's version (after ====) doesn't include this. So if both changes are valid, perhaps the correct resolution is to keep the paragraph from HEAD, as it adds necessary documentation. Alternatively, maybe the other side's version removed it because it's redundant with another part of the documentation. 

But since the user says to preserve the context if unsure, but if I can resolve the conflict by combining the intents, that's better. Wait, but in this case, the conflict is between adding a paragraph (HEAD) and removing it (the other side). So unless there's a way that both can coexist, but in this case, it's a straight addition vs. deletion. 

Wait, perhaps the other side actually has a different version of the same paragraph. Let me check the code again. The code snippet shows that the HEAD version includes the paragraph, and the other side (after ====) has nothing—it just ends the previous </p> and then has another <p> paragraph. Wait, looking at the code:

Original conflict:

<<<<<<< HEAD:...
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
=======
>>>>>>> 01a6cc5...:...

So the HEAD adds that paragraph, and the other side removes it. Therefore, the conflict is between keeping that paragraph (HEAD) and not having it (the other side). 

But why would the other side remove it? Maybe in the other branch, that paragraph was moved elsewhere or the behavior changed. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But according to the user's instructions, if the intent is ambiguous or unsure, return the same snippet with the conflict. 

But maybe the two paragraphs are actually compatible. Wait, looking at the structure, after the first paragraph about Collection, the HEAD adds another paragraph about handling when there's no declared field. The other side's code (after ====) doesn't have that paragraph, but continues with another <p> paragraph. Wait, in the provided code, after the conflict markers, there's another <p> paragraph that starts with "If there is no declared field..." but without the closing </p> in the other side. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the code after the conflict is:

   * </p>
<<<<<<< HEAD:...
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
=======
>>>>>>> 01a6cc5...:...
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.

Wait, no. The code after the conflict markers in the HEAD has that paragraph with a closing </p>, and the other side (after ====) does not have that paragraph. Then, after the conflict markers, the code continues with another <p> paragraph that starts with "If there is no declared field...", but that's part of the existing code. Wait, no, looking at the code snippet provided by the user, the entire conflict is:

<<<<<<< HEAD:...
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
=======
>>>>>>> 01a6cc5...:...
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.

Wait, that's confusing. The code after the ======= and >>>>>>> shows that the other side (01a6cc5) does not have the paragraph that's in HEAD, but then there's another <p> paragraph that's the same as the one in HEAD but without the closing </p>? Or is that part of the same code?

Wait, looking at the user's provided code:

The code before the conflict is:

   * parameter is the declared field class. Declared fields of type {@link Collection} are used to
   * support repeating data key names, so each member of the collection is an additional data key
   * value. They are parsed the same as "primitive" fields, except that the generic type parameter
   * of the collection is used as the {@link Class} parameter.
   * </p>
<<<<<<< HEAD:google-api-client/src/com/google/api/client/http/UrlEncodedParser.java
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
=======
>>>>>>> 01a6cc54669b5ebf1ea1c3e27e424bba99a0ef3c:google-api-client/src/main/java/com/google/api/client/http/UrlEncodedParser.java
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.

Wait, so after the conflict markers, there's another <p> paragraph that is the same as the one in HEAD, but without the closing </p>? That can't be right. Or perhaps the user made a mistake in pasting the code. Let me re-express:

Original code:

After the </p> closing the previous paragraph, the conflict starts. The HEAD adds a new <p> paragraph explaining about the Map case, then closes it with </p>. The other side (from 01a6cc5) does not have that paragraph. However, after the conflict markers, the code continues with another <p> paragraph that's the same as the one added in HEAD but without the closing </p>.

Wait, that's impossible. It's more likely that the user's code snippet has a formatting error. Let me look again.

The user's code snippet as provided is:

   * </p>
<<<<<<< HEAD:google-api-client/src/com/google/api/client/http/UrlEncodedParser.java
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
=======
>>>>>>> 01a6cc54669b5ebf1ea1c3e27e424bba99a0ef3c:google-api-client/src/main/java/com/google/api/client/http/UrlEncodedParser.java
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.

So, the conflict is that in HEAD, there's a <p> paragraph that's properly closed with </p>, and then after the conflict markers (the ==== and >>>>>>), there's another <p> paragraph that's not closed. But that can't be correct. Wait, perhaps the code after the conflict markers is part of the same file, not part of the conflict. Wait, no. The code after the conflict markers is part of the other branch's version. Wait, no. The conflict markers indicate the two versions. So the code between <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= is the HEAD version, and the code between ======= and >>>>>>> is the other branch's version. 

In the HEAD version, after the previous </p>, there's a new <p> paragraph explaining the Map case, closed with </p>. Then the code continues. In the other branch's version, after the previous </p>, there is no such paragraph, but then there's a <p> paragraph that's the same as the one in HEAD, but without the closing </p>. Wait, that can't be. It's more likely that the user made a mistake in pasting the code, and the code after the conflict markers is part of the same file. So perhaps the code in the other branch (after =======) doesn't include the new paragraph, and then the code continues with the next paragraph. But in that case, the next paragraph is the same as the one in the HEAD's added paragraph. That would mean that the two branches have the same paragraph, but one has it closed with </p> and the other doesn't. 

Wait, looking at the code after the conflict markers:

In the HEAD version:

   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * [Paragraph about Map...]
   * </p>

In the other branch's version:

   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * [Same paragraph but without closing </p>?]

But that seems like a mistake. Or perhaps the user pasted the code incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the other branch's code has the same paragraph but without the closing </p>, leading to a merge conflict where one side added the closing tag and the other didn't. 

In that case, the conflict is between having the paragraph with a closing </p> (HEAD) and having it without (the other branch). Or maybe the other branch's code is part of a larger change where the closing tag is moved elsewhere. 

But given the code as provided, the HEAD version has the paragraph with the closing </p>, and the other branch's code does not include that paragraph at all. Then, after the conflict, the code continues with another <p> paragraph that's the same as the one in the HEAD, but without the closing </p>. That suggests that perhaps the other branch's code has the same paragraph but without the closing tag, leading to a conflict. 

Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to reconstruct the code as it is:

Original code before conflict:

   * parameter is the declared field class. Declared fields of type {@link Collection} are used to
   * support repeating data key names, so each member of the collection is an additional data key
   * value. They are parsed the same as "primitive" fields, except that the generic type parameter
   * of the collection is used as the {@link Class} parameter.
   * </p>

Then in HEAD, after that, there's:

   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>

Then the other branch's code (after =======) does not include that paragraph. Then, after the conflict markers, there's:

   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.

But this seems like the same paragraph as in HEAD, but without the closing </p>. That suggests that perhaps the other branch's code includes this paragraph, but without the closing </p>, leading to a conflict where HEAD added the closing tag and the other branch didn't. Or maybe the other branch moved this paragraph elsewhere and it's duplicated. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's code snippet has a mistake, and the paragraph after the conflict markers is part of the original code, leading to a duplication. 

In any case, the merge conflict is between the HEAD adding a paragraph with closing </p> and the other branch either not having it or having it differently. 

But according to the user's instructions, I need to return the entire snippet with the conflict resolved if possible. If unsure, leave the conflict. 

But let's look at the content. The paragraph in HEAD is:

   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>

Then, after the conflict, the code has:

   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.

Which is the same text but without the closing </p>. 

This suggests that the other branch's code has this paragraph but without the closing </p>, while the HEAD adds it with the closing tag. So the conflict is about whether to include the closing tag or not. 

In that case, the correct resolution would be to include the paragraph with the closing </p> from HEAD, because it properly closes the <p> tag, and the other branch's version might have a typo or missing tag. 

Alternatively, if the other branch's code intended to merge the paragraph into a larger one, but that's unclear. 

But based on the information provided, the HEAD version properly closes the <p> tag, while the other branch's code does not. So merging the HEAD version would be correct. 

However, looking at the code after the conflict markers in the user's snippet, the paragraph is duplicated. So the resolved code would have the paragraph twice—once from HEAD and once from the other branch. That can't be right. 

Wait, no. The code after the conflict markers is part of the original code. Let me think again. 

The code structure in the user's snippet is:

Original code before conflict:

... </p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
added paragraph with </p>
=======
>>>>>>> other branch

Then, after the conflict markers:

another <p> paragraph without closing </p>

So if the other branch's code does not have the added paragraph, but the code after the conflict has the same paragraph again, that's a problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user's code snippet is malformed, and the code after the conflict markers is part of the other branch's code. 

But given the way merge conflicts work, the code between <<<<<<< and ======= is from the current branch (HEAD), and the code between ======= and >>>>>>> is from the other branch. 

So in this case, the HEAD adds the paragraph with the closing </p>, and the other branch does not have that paragraph. But after the conflict, the code continues with another <p> paragraph that's the same as the one in HEAD but without the closing </p>. 

That would mean that in the other branch's code, after the previous </p>, there's another <p> paragraph (same as HEAD's) but not closed. So the conflict is between adding a properly closed paragraph (HEAD) and having a similar paragraph later but not closed (other branch). 

In that case, resolving the conflict would require merging the two versions. But perhaps the paragraph in the other branch's code is a continuation, and the HEAD's version is adding it earlier. 

Alternatively, this is a case of a duplicated paragraph. 

But given the ambiguity, the safest approach is to retain the paragraph from HEAD and ensure that the subsequent paragraph is properly closed. However, the user's provided code after the conflict markers has the same content again. 

Alternatively, maybe the conflict is due to the same paragraph being added in both branches but with different formatting (closing tag or not). 

But given the user's instruction to preserve the spacing and not modify the context if unsure, but to resolve the conflict if possible. 

If the intent is that both paragraphs are needed, but in reality, it's a duplication, then merging them into one paragraph with the closing tag would be correct. 

But in this case, since the paragraphs are identical except for the closing tag, perhaps the correct resolution is to take the version from HEAD (with the closing tag) and remove the duplicate paragraph from the other branch. 

Alternatively, the other branch's code may have moved the paragraph to a different location, leading to a conflict. 

But without more context, it's challenging. However, considering that the HEAD's version has the paragraph properly closed and the other branch's code may have an unclosed paragraph, it's better to keep the HEAD's version and ensure the subsequent paragraphs are properly formatted. 

Therefore, the resolved code would include the paragraph from HEAD, properly closed with </p>, and then the subsequent paragraphs as is. 

But looking at the user's code, after the conflict markers, there's another <p> paragraph with the same content. That suggests that in the other branch's code, this paragraph exists without the closing tag, leading to duplication when merged with HEAD. 

In that case, the correct resolution would be to have the paragraph once, properly closed, and remove the duplicate. 

So the resolved code would be:

   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.

But this results in a duplication, which is likely a mistake. Therefore, the actual resolution would be to remove the duplicate paragraph. 

But how did this duplication occur? It seems like in the HEAD, the paragraph is added, and in the other branch's code, the same paragraph is present but without the closing </p>. 

Alternatively, perhaps the other branch's code has a different version of the documentation where this paragraph is part of a larger section. 

Given the ambiguity, the safest approach is to take the HEAD's version and include the paragraph with the closing </p>, and assume that the subsequent paragraph in the other branch's code is a mistake or was intended to be part of a different section. 

Therefore, the resolved code would include the paragraph from HEAD and exclude the duplicate from the other branch. 

But according to the user's code, after the conflict markers, the other branch's code does not have the paragraph, and the code continues with another <p> tag. So the resolved code would be:

Original code before conflict:

   * </p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
   * [HEAD's paragraph]
=======
>>>>>>> other branch
   *
   * <p>
   * [Next paragraph]

So merging HEAD's paragraph and then the next paragraph. 

Thus, the resolved code would be:

   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.

Wait, but that's the same paragraph duplicated, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, this suggests that the other branch's code had a different structure. 

Perhaps the other branch's code moved this paragraph to a different location or modified it. 

In this case, since the user's provided code shows that after the conflict markers, the same paragraph is present but without the closing </p>, the merge conflict is due to both branches modifying the same lines but in different ways. 

However, given the ambiguity and the user's instruction to return the same snippet with the conflict if unsure, but to resolve if possible, I think the correct resolution is to include the paragraph from HEAD, as it's properly closed, and remove the subsequent duplicate. 

But how can that be done without seeing the full context? 

Alternatively, perhaps the other branch's code intended to merge the paragraphs into one. 

Given that, the resolved code should have the paragraph once, properly closed. 

But according to the user's code, after resolving the conflict, the code would include the paragraph from HEAD and then another unclosed paragraph. That can't be correct. 

Therefore, the conflict is likely due to a duplicated paragraph, and the correct resolution is to keep the properly closed one from HEAD and remove the duplicate from the other branch. 

Thus, the final resolved code would include the HEAD's paragraph with the closing </p>, and the subsequent code continues without the duplicate. 

But how does that look in the code? 

The original conflict is between HEAD adding the paragraph and the other branch not having it. But in the user's code, after the conflict markers, there's another <p> paragraph that's the same. 

This suggests that the user's code snippet has a mistake, and the conflict is actually between two versions of the same paragraph: one with a closing </p> and one without. 

In that case, the correct resolution is to keep the version with the closing </p> from HEAD and discard the other version. 

Therefore, the resolved code would be the HEAD's version, and the subsequent code is not part of the conflict. 

But looking back, the user's provided code after the conflict markers is:

   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.

This is part of the other branch's code after the conflict. So the conflict is between adding the paragraph in HEAD and having it in the other branch's code but without the closing </p>. 

Thus, the merge conflict is between two versions of the same paragraph, differing in the presence of the closing </p>. 

The resolution would be to take the version with the closing </p> from HEAD, as it's properly formatted. 

Therefore, the final code after resolution would include the paragraph from HEAD, properly closed, and the subsequent code from the other branch would not have the duplicate. 

But according to the user's code, the other branch's code after the conflict has that paragraph again. That suggests that the other branch's code has this paragraph without the closing </p> after the point where HEAD added it. 

This is likely a duplication error, and the correct resolution is to keep the properly closed version from HEAD and remove the duplicate. 

Thus, the resolved code should include the paragraph from HEAD and omit the subsequent duplicate. 

Therefore, the merged code would look like:

   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
   *
   * ... [rest of the code]

But in the user's provided snippet, after the conflict markers, there's another <p> paragraph. That must be part of the other branch's code. Therefore, in reality, the other branch's code after the conflict includes that paragraph, leading to duplication. 

Thus, the correct resolution is to take the HEAD's version (with the closing </p>) and ignore the other branch's version. 

Therefore, the final answer should include the HEAD's paragraph and exclude the duplicate from the other branch.</think>
