Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The conflict is in the subscribe method of a Java class. The HEAD version has the method as synchronized and includes a log statement, while the other branch (3714d4e) doesn't have synchronized and omits the log.

First, I need to understand the intent of both changes. The HEAD side adds synchronization, which suggests they're concerned about thread safety when adding subscribers. The log statement is for debugging purposes, to track subscriptions. The other side might be removing synchronized, perhaps because they think it's unnecessary or causing performance issues, or maybe they have another way to handle threading.

But wait, maybe the two changes can be combined. The synchronized keyword in the method declaration ensures that only one thread can execute the method at a time, which is important if mSubscribers is a shared resource. If the other branch removed synchronized, that could lead to race conditions if not handled elsewhere. However, the HEAD branch adds it, so merging the two would mean keeping synchronized. The log statement is added functionality, so including that makes sense. The other changes in the method (the messages sent) are the same in both branches, so no conflict there.

So the resolution would be to keep the synchronized keyword from HEAD and include the log statement, while ensuring the method signature is correct. The other branch's version of the method doesn't have synchronized, but since HEAD added it, we should retain that. The log is an addition that doesn't conflict with the other changes. The parameters are the same, so merging both changes by keeping both the synchronized and the log should resolve the conflict without issues.</think>
```java
		} catch (WifiStateException e1) {
			mInfo = null;
		}
		mSubscribers = new HashSet<Handler>();
	}

	public synchronized void subscribe(Handler handler) {
		Log.i("NowPlayingPoller", "Subscribing handler " + handler.getClass().getName() + " to now playing events.");
		// update handler on the state of affairs
		final ICurrentlyPlaying currPlaying = mControl.getCurrentlyPlaying(mManagerStub);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_PROGRESS_CHANGED, currPlaying);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_PLAYLIST_ITEM_CHANGED, currPlaying);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_COVER_CHANGED, currPlaying);
