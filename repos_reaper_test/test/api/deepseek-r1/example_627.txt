Okay, so I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java imports. Let me look at the two versions.

The HEAD version uses static imports from AssertJ: assertThat and failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown. The other branch, a17acec, uses JUnit's static imports like assertEquals, etc. 

Hmm, the conflict is between different testing frameworks. The user might be switching from JUnit's built-in assertions to AssertJ, which is more powerful. Or maybe some tests use one and others use the other. 

But the problem is that the imports are conflicting. If I merge both, it might cause duplicate imports or unnecessary ones. But the correct approach would be to see if both are needed. However, in the context, the original code had AssertJson from testutils, which might relate to AssertJ.

Wait, the HEAD side has the AssertJ imports, and the other side has JUnit's. The correct resolution might be to keep both if the tests use both, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe one branch updated the tests to use AssertJ, and the other had JUnit. 

But since the conflict is in the static imports, maybe the intention was to switch to AssertJ. So the HEAD version is the newer one, and the other branch is older. But without more context, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe some methods from both are used. For example, if some tests use JUnit's assert and others use AssertJ's. But in that case, the imports would need to include both. However, the conflict is between two different sets of static imports. 

Looking at the code after the imports, there's a reference to AssertJson, which might be part of a custom test utility. The HEAD version uses AssertJ's assertThat and failBecause... methods, which are commonly used in AssertJ-style tests. The other side uses JUnit's static imports like assertEquals, etc.

If the tests in the file are using both, then merging both imports would be necessary. But in Java, you can have multiple static imports. However, the conflict is that the two versions are replacing each other. 

Wait, the conflict is in the import statements. The HEAD has:

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown;

The other branch has:

import static org.junit.Assert.*;

So the question is, which imports are needed. If the file uses methods from both, then we need to include both imports. But if the file was migrated from JUnit to AssertJ, then we should take the HEAD version and remove the JUnit imports.

But without seeing the rest of the file, it's hard to know. For example, if the code has assertions using assertThat, then the HEAD is correct. If it's using assertEquals, then the JUnit import is needed.

The user provided a snippet that includes the package statement and some imports. The code after the imports has a reference to AssertJson.testJsonEquals, which might be a custom method. 

But in the absence of more context, perhaps the best approach is to combine both imports. Because maybe some tests use JUnit asserts and others use AssertJ. However, in Java, you can have multiple static imports. So the resolved code would include both:

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

But wait, the original conflict is between the two import blocks. The HEAD has two specific AssertJ imports, and the other side has a wildcard import for JUnit Assert. 

But merging them would require adding both sets. However, the user said to think about the intent and semantics. If one side is replacing the other, then we should pick the correct one. 

Alternatively, maybe the HEAD is adding AssertJ imports while the other branch is adding JUnit's. But if the file was previously using JUnit and the HEAD is migrating to AssertJ, then the correct resolution is to keep the AssertJ imports and remove the JUnit ones. But if both are used, then both should be kept.

But without knowing which methods are used in the code, it's risky. However, given that the HEAD version has specific imports (assertThat and failBecause...) and the other side uses a wildcard, maybe the intent was to switch to AssertJ and remove JUnit. 

Alternatively, the JUnit import might be necessary for other assertions. For example, if the code has both styles. 

But in the absence of more information, perhaps the safest way is to keep both imports. However, the user said to resolve the conflict if possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the two imports are in conflict because they are in the same place. The user might have switched from JUnit to AssertJ, so the correct resolution is to take the HEAD version and discard the JUnit import. But how can I be sure?

Another angle: the HEAD version imports specific AssertJ methods, while the other imports all JUnit Assert methods. If the code after the conflict uses both, then merging both is needed. But if the code was refactored to use AssertJ, then the JUnit imports are no longer needed.

Given that the conflict is in the import section, and the rest of the code isn't shown, it's challenging. But since the user is asking to resolve based on intent and semantics, perhaps the two branches are trying to use different assertion libraries. The correct resolution would depend on which one is intended. 

But since I don't have enough context, maybe I should leave the conflict as is. Wait, the user said if unsure, return the same snippet with the conflict. But the user wants me to resolve if possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use both imports, but that's not possible because they are in conflict. The user has to choose one or the other, or include both. 

In Java, you can have multiple static imports. So merging both would be:

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

But how to present that. The original conflict is between the two blocks. So in the merged code, we need to include both sets of imports. 

But the original code in the conflict shows that the HEAD has two lines, and the other branch has one line. So merging them would result in three lines. 

But how were the imports structured before the conflict? Maybe the original file had one set, and each branch modified it. So merging requires combining both. 

Therefore, the correct resolution is to include both the AssertJ imports and the JUnit Assert wildcard. 

But some might argue against wildcard imports, but the user hasn't specified that. 

So the resolved code would have:

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

That way, all necessary static imports are included. 

But perhaps the JUnit wildcard is redundant if the tests are using only specific methods. But since the other branch uses the wildcard, maybe the code relies on it. 

In that case, the resolved code should include both. So the answer is to merge the two import blocks, keeping all three lines. 

Therefore, the final merged code would have the two AssertJ static imports and the JUnit wildcard.</think>
