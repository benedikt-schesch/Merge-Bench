Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The code snippet shows a conflict in the Javadoc comments for the fileSize method. The HEAD version has the @param filename tag, while the other branch (1488b22) adds the @return tag. 

First, I need to understand what each side is doing. The HEAD has the @param, which is correct because the method has a filename parameter. The other branch adds an @return to document the return value, which is also good practice. These two changes don't conflict semantically; they're both adding different Javadoc tags. 

The conflict markers are indicating that both changes were made in the same area. Since they're separate tags, they should coexist. So the correct resolution is to combine both the @param and @return tags in the Javadoc.

Looking at the spacing, the conflict occurs between the two tags. The HEAD has the @param line, and the other branch adds @return below it. The correct merged Javadoc should include both tags. So the resolved code will have both @param and @return, maintaining the order as they appeared. The @return was added by the other branch, so it should come after the @param.

Also, checking if there are any other differences. The method signature and the rest of the context remain the same. The throws declaration is present in both, so no issues there.

Therefore, merging both tags into the Javadoc without any conflicts. The final comment block should include both @param filename and @return length of the file in bytes, followed by @throws IOException.</think>
```java

    /**
     * Returns the length of a file in bytes which exists in the HDFS (accounts for replication).
     * @param filename
     * @return length of the file in bytes
     * @throws IOException
     */
    public long fileSize(String filename) throws IOException {
        DataStorage dfs = pigContext.getDfs();
        ElementDescriptor elem = dfs.asElement(filename);
