Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. So, looking at the code snippet, there's a conflict between the HEAD version and the branch version. The method in question is focusOnField with a parameter CreditEntryFieldBase field.

In the HEAD version, the method checks if textHelper is not null and sets the text using field.getHelperText(). Then there's the closing bracket for the method. But in the other branch (23596e4), the method focusOnField(field) is calling another overloaded method focusOnField(field, null), and then the method with two parameters is defined below.

Hmm, so the intent here seems to be that one side added an overloaded method that takes an initialFieldValue, and the other side added some logic to set the helper text. The conflict arises because both changes are modifying the same method signature in different ways.

Wait, the HEAD version has the method body with textHelper, and the other branch has the method body that delegates to the two-parameter method. So the correct resolution might be to combine both changes. That is, in the single-parameter focusOnField method, we should both set the helper text (if textHelper is not null) and then call the two-parameter version with null as the second argument.

So the merged method would first handle the textHelper part and then call focusOnField(field, null). But wait, does the two-parameter method also handle the textHelper? Let me check the code. The two-parameter method's code is about requesting focus and handling scrolling. It doesn't mention textHelper. So the textHelper logic in the HEAD is only in the single-parameter method, and the other branch's single-parameter method is just a call to the two-parameter one.

So to resolve, the single-parameter method should include both the textHelper logic and then call the two-parameter method. Because otherwise, if we just call the two-parameter method, the textHelper part from HEAD would be lost. Alternatively, maybe the textHelper logic should be moved into the two-parameter method so that both overloads use it. But since the two-parameter method in the other branch doesn't have that code, perhaps the correct approach is to merge the textHelper code into the single-parameter method and then delegate to the two-parameter method.

So the resolved method would be:

public void focusOnField(final CreditEntryFieldBase field) {
    if (this.textHelper != null) {
        this.textHelper.setText(field.getHelperText());
    }
    focusOnField(field, null);
}

Then the two-parameter method remains as it is. That way, both the textHelper setup and the delegation to the two-parameter method happen. This combines the changes from both branches. The textHelper is set when focusing on the field, and then the actual focus and scrolling logic is handled by the two-parameter method.

Yes, that makes sense. The key is to ensure that the logic from both branches is preserved. The HEAD adds the textHelper part, and the other branch adds the overloaded method. By including both in the single-parameter method, we satisfy both intents.</think>

        securityCodeText.setOnFocusChangeListener(l);
        zipCodeText.setOnFocusChangeListener(l);
    }

    public void focusOnField(final CreditEntryFieldBase field) {
        if (this.textHelper != null) {
            this.textHelper.setText(field.getHelperText());
        }
        focusOnField(field, null);
    }

    public void focusOnField(final CreditEntryFieldBase field, String initialFieldValue) {
        field.requestFocus();
        if(!scrolling) {
            scrolling = true;
