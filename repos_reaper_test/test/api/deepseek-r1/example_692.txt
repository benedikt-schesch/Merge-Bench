Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in a Java file, specifically around some static Property declarations. The conflict markers show that the HEAD version has a line declaring failureNotificationsDelayProperty as an IntProperty with a default value of 5000. The other side, from commit d72e83e, doesn't have that line.

So, the problem is that one branch added the failureNotificationsDelayProperty, and the other branch might have removed it or it's not present. But wait, looking at the surrounding context, both sides have the same properties before and after the conflict area. The lines before the conflict are the same in both versions, and after the conflict, the success properties are the same.

The key here is to determine if the failureNotificationsDelayProperty was intentionally added in HEAD and needs to be kept, or if the other branch removed it. Since the conflict shows that the other branch (d72e83e) doesn't have that line, it's possible that one branch added it and the other didn't. But since there's no indication that the line was modified or removed in the other branch, it's more likely a case where one branch added the line and the other didn't touch it. Therefore, to resolve the conflict, we should keep the addition from HEAD because it's a new property that the other branch doesn't conflict with. The other branch's version just doesn't have that line, so merging would include the new property.

Therefore, the resolved code should include the failureNotificationsDelayProperty line from HEAD, ensuring that the new property is retained in the merged code. The rest of the context remains unchanged.</think>
