Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The user wants me to resolve it based on the semantics and intent of both sides. The code snippet shows a conflict between the HEAD and the branch d03dac9db71fadc7ff2663477514f7d0d10b3d94.

In the HEAD version, there's a line where they're parsing a parameter called AjaxRequest.BLANKS_LIMIT into an integer called blanksLimit. On the other branch, they're retrieving the oldPassword from the game object. Then, both versions have the code that gets the password from the request parameter.

I need to figure out if these two lines are independent changes that can coexist. The blanksLimit line is about a limit for blanks, probably related to some game settings. The oldPassword line is about getting the current password of the game. These seem like separate concerns. Maybe one was added in one branch and the other in another branch, so both lines should be included.

Looking at the surrounding code: before the conflict, there's code adding card sets. After the conflict, they handle the password parameter. The two conflicting lines are in the same spot, so the merge conflict arises because both branches added different lines there.

Since they don't modify the same variables or affect each other's logic, including both lines in the resolved code makes sense. The order might matter, but if there's no dependency between them, either order could work. However, I should check the order in both branches. The HEAD has blanksLimit first, then the other branch has oldPassword. But since they're separate, maybe both can be kept. Wait, but in a merge, when two branches add different lines at the same position, the correct resolution is to include both, but the order might depend on the intended flow. 

Wait, looking again, after the conflict, both branches have the password handling. So maybe the correct approach is to take both lines. Let me see: the code after the conflict is about password. The HEAD adds blanksLimit before that, and the other branch adds oldPassword. So perhaps both lines are needed. Therefore, the resolved code should include both lines, in the order they were added. But how? The conflict is between the two lines. So the correct resolution would be to keep both, placing one after the other. But since they are conflicting at the same spot, the user would need to decide the order. However, maybe the intended resolution is to take both changes. So in the merged code, both lines should be present. Therefore, the resolved code would have:

        final int blanksLimit = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(AjaxRequest.BLANKS_LIMIT));
        final String oldPassword = game.getPassword();

But how to merge that. Since the two lines are from different branches, the conflict markers need to be removed and both lines included. So in the resolved code, both lines are present. The order might depend on which is more logical. If the oldPassword is needed before processing the new password, perhaps the oldPassword line comes first. Alternatively, if the blanksLimit is part of the same setup as the cardSets, maybe it comes first. Without more context, it's hard to tell. But since both lines are added in their respective branches, and there's no overlap in variables, the correct semantic resolution is to include both. Therefore, the merged code should include both lines. The user probably intended both changes to be included. So the conflict is resolved by keeping both lines.</think>
```java
          if (!cardSetId.isEmpty()) {
            cardSets.add((CardSet) game.getHibernateSession().load(CardSet.class,
                Integer.parseInt(cardSetId)));
          }
        }
        final int blanksLimit = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(AjaxRequest.BLANKS_LIMIT));
        final String oldPassword = game.getPassword();
        String password = request.getParameter(AjaxRequest.PASSWORD);
        if (password == null) {
          password = "";
        }
        // We're not directly assigning this with Boolean.valueOf() because we want to default to
