Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java method. Let me look at the two versions.

In the HEAD version, the line is:
final List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>> data = new ArrayList<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>(cards.size());

And in the other branch, it's:
final List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>> data = new ArrayList<>(cards.size());

The difference is the use of the diamond operator <> in the second version. Java 7 introduced the diamond operator to allow the compiler to infer the type arguments from the context, so you don't have to specify them again on the right side. The HEAD version explicitly states the generic types, which is redundant. The other branch uses the diamond operator, which is cleaner and more modern. 

Since both versions are initializing an ArrayList with the initial capacity of cards.size(), the intent is the same. The only difference is syntax. Using the diamond operator is better practice here because it reduces redundancy without changing the functionality. Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the version with the diamond operator from the other branch. The rest of the code remains the same, so the conflict markers can be removed, keeping that line.</think>
```java
   *
   * @param cards Cards to convert to client data.
   * @return Client representation of {@code cards}.
   */
  private List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>> getWhiteCardData(final List<WhiteCard> cards) {
    final List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>> data = new ArrayList<>(cards.size());
    for (final WhiteCard card : cards) {
      data.add(card.getClientData());
    }
    return data;
  }
```
