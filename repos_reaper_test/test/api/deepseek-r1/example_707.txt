Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the getUserPlaylist method. The HEAD version has the line where the user is URLEncoded, and the other side (from commit 5e4c209) has an extra line with just a blank line after the method declaration. Wait, no, actually, looking at the conflict markers:

HEAD has:
		try {
			user = URLEncoder.encode(user, "UTF-8" );

And the other side has:
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

>>>>>>> 5e4c2091dc2827219ba601937e8686bcb90bae78
		try {
So the conflict is between the HEAD version which doesn't have an extra blank line after the method declaration, and the other branch which adds a blank line there. Wait, the code in the conflict shows that the HEAD side has the line starting with "try" immediately after the method declaration, while the other branch has a blank line before the "try". So the conflict is about whether there's a blank line between the method declaration and the try block.

The user is asking to resolve this semantically, considering the intent of both sides. The actual code changes in both branches are the same except for that whitespace. Since whitespace differences like extra blank lines are often a matter of code style and don't affect functionality, the semantic intent is the same. The conflict is just about formatting. In such cases, it's safe to accept either version, but perhaps the one that adds a blank line for readability. But wait, looking at the code, the HEAD version doesn't have the blank line, and the other branch adds it. However, in the conflict presented, the HEAD side is the one without the blank line, and the incoming change adds a blank line. So the resolution would be to keep the blank line if that's the intended style. Alternatively, maybe the blank line was added by one developer for readability, while the other didn't have it. Since it's a trivial difference, merging them by including the blank line would resolve the conflict without issues. But the user says if unsure, leave the conflict. However, in this case, it's a simple whitespace change. The correct resolution is to remove the conflict markers and keep the blank line. Because the two changes are not conflicting in terms of code logic, just formatting. Therefore, the resolved code should include the blank line from the incoming branch. Wait, looking again: the conflict is between the HEAD version which has no blank line, and the other branch which adds a blank line. So the merge would have the blank line. Therefore, the resolved code would have the blank line between the method declaration and the try block. So the correct merged code would be:

	@Override
	public PlaylistRemote[] getUserPlaylist(String user) throws JSONException, WSError {

		try {
			user = URLEncoder.encode(user, "UTF-8" );
			...

So the conflict is resolved by taking the version with the blank line. Therefore, the answer should merge that, removing the conflict markers.</think>
