Okay, let me look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the JavaDoc comment for the removeSpectator method. The HEAD version says the method synchronizes on {@link #spectator}, while the other branch says {@link #spectators}. 

First, I need to figure out which one is correct. The parameter in the method is a single User, so removing a spectator. The variable name in the code is probably either spectator or spectators. If the field is a collection, like a list of spectators, then the correct name would be spectators. Synchronizing on a collection makes sense if multiple spectators are managed.

Looking at the method name removeSpectator, it's removing one user from a collection. So the field should be a collection, hence plural 'spectators'. The HEAD version has the singular, which might be a typo or outdated. The other branch's change to plural is likely correct. 

So the correct link should be spectators. Therefore, resolving the conflict by choosing the incoming change from the 5adedd2 commit.</think>
```java
  }

  /**
   * Remove a spectator from the game.
   * <br/>
   * Synchronizes on {@link #spectators}.
   *
   * @param user Spectator to remove from the game.
   */
  public void removeSpectator(final User user) {
    logger.info(String.format("Removing spectator %s from game %d.", user.toString(), id));
```
