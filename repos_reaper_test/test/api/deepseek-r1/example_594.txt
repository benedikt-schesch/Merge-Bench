Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The HEAD side has a test method called emptyFacebookMap(), which creates a MapObject and asserts the JSON output. The other side, from commit a17acec, removed that test and added a comment and a test called emptyObject(). 

The conflict is because one branch added a test and the other removed it or modified the same area. I need to figure out the intent. The emptyFacebookMap test seems to check serialization of a MapObject, while emptyObject might be a more general test. Are these tests overlapping or conflicting?

Looking at the surrounding code, both tests are similar in structure. The emptyObject test's comment says it's about handling an empty object, which might be related. Maybe the emptyFacebookMap was specific to Facebook maps, but the emptyObject is a more general case. It's possible that the emptyFacebookMap test was redundant or replaced by emptyObject. Alternatively, they could be testing different things.

If the intent is to keep both tests, then both should be included. But if the emptyObject test was meant to replace the emptyFacebookMap, then the conflict should be resolved by keeping the new test and the comment. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. The user said to resolve based on semantics and intent. If the two tests are separate, both should remain. But since the conflict is between adding a test in HEAD and removing it in the other branch, maybe the correct resolution is to keep both the existing tests and the new comment and emptyObject test. Wait, the conflict shows that in HEAD, the emptyFacebookMap test is present, and in the other branch, it's removed, and the emptyObject test is added. But looking at the code structure, the emptyObject test is after the conflict markers. So perhaps the correct resolution is to keep both tests. Wait, the code in HEAD has the emptyFacebookMap test, and the other branch has the emptyObject test added below where the conflict is. Wait, the conflict is between the HEAD adding emptyFacebookMap and the other branch removing that block and adding a comment and emptyObject. So the conflict is whether to keep the emptyFacebookMap test or replace it with the emptyObject test. But maybe they can coexist. Are the test methods different? Yes, one is emptyFacebookMap, the other is emptyObject. So perhaps both should be kept. But the conflict markers show that in HEAD, the test is present, and in the other branch, it's removed. So if the other branch removed it, maybe that's intentional. Alternatively, maybe the emptyFacebookMap was a mistake and the correct approach is to have the emptyObject test. But without knowing the project's context, it's hard. The user said to think about the intent. The emptyObject test's comment says it's about handling the empty object, which might be a more general case. Maybe the emptyFacebookMap was a specific case that's no longer needed, or perhaps it's a duplicate. If the two tests are testing different things, both should stay. But if the emptyObject test supersedes the emptyFacebookMap, then the latter should be removed. 

Since the conflict is between adding the emptyFacebookMap test in one branch and adding the emptyObject test in another, perhaps the resolution is to keep both tests. However, looking at the code structure, the conflict is in the middle of the test methods. The HEAD version has the emptyFacebookMap test between the first test and the emptyObject test. The other branch has the emptyObject test without the emptyFacebookMap. So the conflict is whether to include the emptyFacebookMap or not. If both tests are valid and necessary, they should both be present. But maybe the other branch deleted the emptyFacebookMap test for a reason. Alternatively, perhaps the emptyFacebookMap was added in a feature branch, and the other branch added the emptyObject test in a different place. 

Wait, the code before the conflict is:

  }
  
<<<<<<< HEAD
  @Test
  public void emptyFacebookMap() {
    MapObject obj = new MapObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }

>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  /**
   * Can we handle the empty object?
   */
  @Test
  public void emptyObject() {

So in HEAD, there's the emptyFacebookMap test, then the comment and emptyObject test. In the other branch, the emptyFacebookMap is removed, and the comment and emptyObject are added. Wait, noâ€”the conflict is that the other branch (a17acec) removed the emptyFacebookMap test and added the comment and emptyObject. So the question is whether to keep the emptyFacebookMap test or not. If the other branch intentionally removed it, perhaps because it's no longer needed or was moved elsewhere, then the resolution would be to accept their deletion and add the new test. But if the emptyFacebookMap is still relevant, it should stay. 

But how do we know? The tests are similar: both create an object, serialize it, and check the JSON. The emptyFacebookMap uses MapObject, and the emptyObject might be using a different object. Wait, the emptyObject test's code isn't shown here. The code snippet provided ends with the emptyObject method declaration. So maybe the emptyObject test is a different case. If the two tests are separate, then both should be kept. However, the conflict arises because one branch added a test and the other removed it. If the intent of the a17acec branch was to remove the emptyFacebookMap test and add the emptyObject, then the correct resolution is to remove the emptyFacebookMap and keep the emptyObject. But perhaps the user intended to have both. 

Alternatively, maybe the emptyFacebookMap test was added in HEAD, and the other branch added the emptyObject test. The merge conflict is because both branches modified the same area. In that case, the correct resolution is to keep both tests. So the resolved code would have the emptyFacebookMap test followed by the comment and emptyObject test. 

But looking at the code structure, the emptyFacebookMap test in HEAD is between the first test (which is probably the one with ListObject) and the emptyObject test. The a17acec branch removes the emptyFacebookMap test and adds the comment and emptyObject. So the conflict is between keeping or removing the emptyFacebookMap. 

If the a17acec branch's commit message indicates that they're refactoring tests, perhaps the emptyFacebookMap was redundant. Alternatively, maybe the emptyFacebookMap was a mistake and the correct test is emptyObject. 

Since the user instructs to resolve based on intent and semantics, and if unsure, leave the conflict. But if we can see that both tests are valid, they should be merged. However, in the code provided, the emptyFacebookMap test and the emptyObject test are separate. So the correct resolution is to keep both. Therefore, the resolved code would include both tests. 

But in the conflict markers, the HEAD has the emptyFacebookMap test, and the other branch has nothing in that spot except the comment and emptyObject. So merging them would require including the emptyFacebookMap test and then the comment and emptyObject. Therefore, the resolved code would have:

  }

  @Test
  public void emptyFacebookMap() {
    MapObject obj = new MapObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }

  /**
   * Can we handle the empty object?
   */
  @Test
  public void emptyObject() {

So the conflict is resolved by keeping both tests. Therefore, the merged code should include both the emptyFacebookMap and emptyObject tests, along with the comment. The conflict markers are removed, and both sections are kept.</think>
```java
    ListObject obj = new ListObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }

  @Test
  public void emptyFacebookMap() {
    MapObject obj = new MapObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }

  /**

  @Test
  public void emptyObject() {
