Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict in the imports section of a Java file. The HEAD version is importing JacksonFactory from com.google.api.client.json.jackson2, while the other branch (63ed2cae) is adding several imports related to IO and collections, like IOException, URLDecoder, HashMap, and Map. 

First, I need to understand the context. The class is part of the Utils tests, so maybe both changes are necessary. The HEAD imports are for JSON handling, which the test might need. The other branch's imports suggest that there's code added that deals with URL decoding, exceptions, and maps. 

Since both sets of imports are likely used in different parts of the test, the correct resolution is to include all necessary imports. The conflict markers can be removed, and both import lines should be kept. However, I need to check if any of the imports are redundant or if there's an order, but in Java, it's okay to have multiple imports as long as they're used.

So the resolved code should include both the JacksonFactory import and the IO/net imports. The conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) are removed, and all imports from both branches are retained. The order might not matter here, but preserving the original order from each branch makes sense. So the final imports section will have the JsonFactory import, followed by JacksonFactory, then the IO and util imports from the other branch.</think>
