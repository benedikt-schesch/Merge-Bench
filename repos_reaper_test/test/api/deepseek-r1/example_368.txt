Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the VERSION constant. The HEAD version is 1.3.3-alpha, and the other branch has 1.4.0-alpha. Both sides are trying to set the library version, but they have different values.

The comment says it's the current version of the Google API Client Library for Java, and the @since tag is 1.3. The HEAD version is a patch update (1.3.3-alpha) while the other branch is a minor version bump (1.4.0-alpha). 

I need to determine which version is correct. Since it's a merge conflict, maybe both changes were made independently. If the intent is to release a new minor version, 1.4.0 would be appropriate. But if HEAD is a maintenance branch for 1.3.x, then 1.3.3 makes sense.

However, without more context, it's hard to tell which is the intended version. The user might have intended to update to 1.4.0 as a new release, but the conflict remains because both changes modify the same line. Since I can't be sure, I should leave the conflict as is for the user to resolve.</think>
```java
  /**
   * Current version of the Google API Client Library for Java.
   *
   * @since 1.3
   */
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public static final String VERSION = "1.3.3-alpha";
=======
  public static final String VERSION = "1.4.0-alpha";
>>>>>>> f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b

  /**
   * Line separator to use for this OS, i.e. {@code "\n"} or {@code "\r\n"}.
   */
  public static final String LINE_SEPARATOR = System.getProperty("line.separator");

```

This conflict requires semantic understanding to resolve - both branches are attempting to update the library version, but to different values. Without additional context about versioning policies or release plans, it's impossible to automatically determine which version string is correct. The conflict has been preserved for human resolution.
