Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java imports section between HEAD and the other branch. The goal is to resolve this conflict by understanding the intent of both changes and combining them correctly.

First, the HEAD version imports:
- DefaultJBakeConfiguration
- JBakeConfiguration
- JBakeConfigurationFactory

The other branch (from commit 1b4df42) imports:
- ConfigUtil
- DefaultJBakeConfiguration
- JBakeConfiguration

So both sides are importing DefaultJBakeConfiguration and JBakeConfiguration. The difference is that HEAD adds JBakeConfigurationFactory, while the other branch adds ConfigUtil. 

I need to check if these two classes (JBakeConfigurationFactory and ConfigUtil) are both needed. Maybe one branch added one and the other added another, and they don't conflict. So the correct resolution would be to include all the necessary imports from both sides. Since there's no overlap in those specific imports, they can coexist. 

So the resolved imports should include:
- org.jbake.app.configuration.DefaultJBakeConfiguration
- org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfiguration
- org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfigurationFactory (from HEAD)
- org.jbake.app.configuration.ConfigUtil (from the other branch)

Therefore, the merged import statements should combine both, removing the conflict markers. The order might not matter, but preserving the original order from one side or the other. The HEAD had JBakeConfigurationFactory after the others, and the other branch has ConfigUtil first. Maybe we can list them in the order they appear, combining both. 

So the merged imports would be:

import org.jbake.app.configuration.ConfigUtil;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.DefaultJBakeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfigurationFactory;

That way, all necessary classes are imported, and the conflict is resolved by taking both sides' changes. There's no ambiguity here because the two branches added different imports, so they should both be included.</think>
