Okay, so I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code snippet. Let's look at the conflict. The conflict is in the author list. The HEAD version includes Mikhail Mazursky, while the other branch (18ac819...) includes Nicolas François. 

The goal here is to merge the two changes without losing any authors. Since both are adding an @author line, the correct resolution should be to include both names. The order might matter, but typically, in such cases, we list all contributors. The original order in the HEAD has Mikhail Mazursky after Joel Costigliola, and the other branch adds Nicolas François in the same place. So the correct merge would be to have both authors listed.

I should check if there are any other conflicts in the surrounding code, but in the provided snippet, the conflict is only in the authors. The rest of the code is the same on both sides. So the solution is to remove the conflict markers and keep both authors. The order could be either, but since HEAD has Mikhail first and the other branch has Nicolas, maybe we can list both, perhaps in alphabetical order or as per contribution, but without more context, including both is safe.

So the resolved block would have all four authors: Alex Ruiz, Joel Costigliola, Mikhail Mazursky, and Nicolas François. The correct syntax would be to list them all without conflict markers.</think>
