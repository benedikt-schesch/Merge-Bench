Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let's look at the code snippet.

The conflict is between the HEAD and another branch. In the HEAD version, there's a line adding REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(Instantiator.class, VRaptorInstantiator.class);. The other branch doesn't have this line, just removes it.

What's the intent here? The code is part of a block where different components are being added to a map called REQUEST_COMPONENTS. The 'else' block suggests that depending on some condition, different implementations are registered.

In the HEAD version, both InstantiatorWithErrors and Instantiator are using VRaptorInstantiator.class. The other branch only has InstantiatorWithErrors. Maybe the other branch removed the Instantiator line because it's redundant or moved elsewhere. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

Wait, maybe VRaptorInstantiator implements both InstantiatorWithErrors and Instantiator interfaces. So registering the same class for both interfaces makes sense. If the other branch removed the Instantiator line, that might be an error, or perhaps they intended to use a different class. But since the conflict is that the other branch deleted the line, while HEAD added it, the correct resolution would depend on which change is correct.

If both changes are valid but conflicting, perhaps the line should be kept. Maybe the other branch's deletion was a mistake, or maybe the HEAD's addition is the correct one. Without more context, it's possible that the line was added intentionally in HEAD and the other branch didn't have it. So to preserve both changes, we should keep the line from HEAD. Therefore, the resolved code should include the line adding Instantiator.class with VRaptorInstantiator.class.</think>
```java
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(OgnlFacade.class, OgnlFacade.class);
        } else {
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(ParametersProvider.class, IogiParametersProvider.class);
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(ParameterNamesProvider.class, VRaptorParameterNamesProvider.class);
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(InstantiatorWithErrors.class, VRaptorInstantiator.class);
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(Instantiator.class, VRaptorInstantiator.class);
        }

        return Collections.unmodifiableMap(REQUEST_COMPONENTS);
    }
```

The conflict is resolved by keeping both `InstantiatorWithErrors` and `Instantiator` registrations since they represent distinct interface/implementation pairs. The semantic intent appears to be registering multiple implementations from the same VRaptorInstantiator class, which likely implements both interfaces. There's no logical contradiction in having both entries - they serve different purposes in the component map.
