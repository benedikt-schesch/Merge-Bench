Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code has a conflict in the declaration of the `session` variable. The HEAD version has `Session session;` with an indentation of a tab, while the other branch (1488b22ce...) has `Session session;` with four spaces. Wait, no, actually looking closer: in the conflict markers, the HEAD side has the line `Session session;` indented with a tab, and the other side doesn't have that line at all. Wait, no, the conflict is between the HEAD version which adds the line `	Session session;` (with a tab) and the other side which doesn't have that line. But in the context after the conflict, there's another `Session session;` line.

Wait, let me parse the code snippet again. The code shows:

<<<<<<< HEAD

	Session session;
=======
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309

    Session session;

So in the HEAD, there's a line with a tab-indented `Session session;`, and the other branch doesn't have that line. But after the conflict, there's another line `    Session session;` with four spaces. So the conflict is between adding a line with a tab in HEAD and the other branch not having that line, but then after the conflict, there's a line with four spaces. Wait, maybe the code after the conflict is part of the common context. Let me check the original code again.

The original code snippet is:

<<<<<<< HEAD

	Session session;
=======
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309

    Session session;

So the conflict is between the HEAD adding a line `Session session;` with a tab, and the other branch not having that line. Then, outside the conflict, there's another `Session session;` line with four spaces of indentation. Wait, that can't be right. Because the code after the conflict markers is part of the same file. So the conflict is that in HEAD, there's a line with a tab, and in the other branch, that line is absent. But after merging, the code continues with another line that declares `Session session;` with four spaces. That's confusing because that line is outside the conflict markers. Wait, maybe the code structure is:

The code before the conflict is:

private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImplFactory.class);

Then, in HEAD, there's a line `Session session;` with a tab. In the other branch, there's nothing between the log line and the line `Session session;` with four spaces. So the conflict is between adding the session declaration twice with different indentation. Wait, maybe the other branch's code has the `Session session;` line after the conflict marker. Let me recheck.

The original code given is:

<<<<<<< HEAD

	Session session;
=======
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309

    Session session;

So the conflict is between the HEAD version adding a tab-indented `Session session;` and the other branch not adding anything. Then, after the conflict, there's another line `Session session;` with four spaces. That would result in a duplicate declaration if both are kept. But that can't be correct because Java doesn't allow duplicate variable declarations. So the conflict arises because both branches added the `session` variable, but with different indentation and possibly in different places. Wait, but the code after the conflict markers is part of the current code. Maybe the user intended to have only one declaration. The HEAD added it with a tab, and the other branch added it with four spaces. So the correct resolution is to keep only one declaration, choosing the correct indentation. However, looking at the surrounding code, the existing code uses spaces for indentation. For example, the line `private static final Log log = ...` is indented with four spaces. So the HEAD's tab-indented line is inconsistent. Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the version with four spaces, removing the tab-indented line. Hence, the conflict can be resolved by keeping the line `    Session session;` and discarding the HEAD's line. But in the original code, the line after the conflict is `    Session session;`, which is from the other branch. Wait, the original code in the conflict is: the HEAD adds a line with a tab, and the other branch doesn't have that line. But after the conflict, there's a line with four spaces. Wait, maybe the code after the conflict is part of the common code. So the actual conflict is that the HEAD added a line `	Session session;` (tab) before the existing line `    Session session;` (four spaces), which is present in both branches. But that would result in duplicate declarations. Therefore, the conflict is because one branch added a duplicate line with a different indentation. But that's impossible in Java. Therefore, the correct resolution is to realize that the line was added in both branches but with different indentation, and to choose the correct one. Since the existing code uses four spaces, the correct indentation is four spaces, so we remove the tab-indented line from HEAD and keep the existing one. Therefore, the resolved code should have only one `Session session;` line with four spaces. Hence, the conflict markers should be removed, keeping the line from the other branch and discarding the HEAD's line. But in the code provided, after the conflict markers, there's already a line `    Session session;`. So perhaps the conflict is between the HEAD adding a line with a tab and the other branch not having it, but the line after the conflict is part of the base code. Wait, maybe the base code had the line `    Session session;` already. Then, in the HEAD, someone added another line with a tab, leading to a conflict. But that would be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the line was moved. But this is getting complicated. The best approach is to ensure that only one declaration exists. Therefore, the resolved code should have a single `Session session;` declaration with the correct indentation (four spaces, as per the existing code). Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by removing the HEAD's line (with the tab) and keeping the line from the other branch (with four spaces). But in the given code, after the conflict markers, the line `    Session session;` is already present. Therefore, the correct resolution is to delete the conflicting lines (the HEAD's line and the conflict markers) and keep the existing line. Therefore, the resolved code would have:

private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImplFactory.class);

    Session session;

    public static SSHSocketImplFactory getFactory() throws JSchException, IOException {

So the conflict is resolved by keeping the four-space indented line and discarding the tabbed one from HEAD. Thus, the merge conflict is resolved.</think>
