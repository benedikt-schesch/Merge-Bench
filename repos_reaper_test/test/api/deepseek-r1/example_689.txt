Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The test method testRebuildCommand has a conflict in the values of nodeCount and relCount. The HEAD version uses 1834 and 2840, while the other branch uses 1854 and 2898. 

Hmm, both sides are changing the numbers, probably reflecting different test scenarios or updates. Since these are test data, the correct values might depend on recent changes. Maybe one branch added more nodes and relationships, hence the higher counts. 

But without more context, it's hard to know which one is correct. The conflict markers are in the test, so maybe the test was updated in both branches independently. If I can't determine the intent, I should leave the conflict as is. However, maybe the numbers are just placeholders and the exact values don't matter. But tests often rely on specific values for assertions.

Wait, the surrounding code has a string fullIndexRebuildOutput that mentions re-indexing all nodes. The numbers might be expected outputs. If both branches made changes that affect the expected counts, merging them would require picking the correct updated values. Since I don't know which branch is more recent or correct, the safest approach is to keep the conflict markers and let the user decide. Therefore, the resolved code should include both versions, but since the user asked to resolve if possible, maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, perhaps both changes are valid and need to be combined. But the variables are declared as final, so they can't be both. So the conflict remains. The user instructions say to return the same snippet with the conflict if unsure. So I should leave it as is.</think>
```java
	@Test
	public void testRebuildCommand() {

		final Console console = new Console(securityContext, ConsoleMode.JavaScript, Collections.emptyMap());

<<<<<<< HEAD
		final int nodeCount           = 1834;
		final int relCount            = 2840;
=======
		final int nodeCount           = 1854;
		final int relCount            = 2898;
>>>>>>> cad117dce3ee314fe51d4648bd8c6cf07aeb0c87
		final int resourceAccessCount = 0;
		final int typedNodeCount      = 669;

		final String fullIndexRebuildOutput =
			"Node type not set or no entity class found. Starting (re-)indexing all nodes\r\n" +
``` 

The conflict remains unresolved because:
- Both branches appear to be updating test data values independently
- Without additional context about which numerical values reflect the correct expected state
- The exact counts could be tied to specific test assertions that require precise values
- There's no semantic overlap that allows merging both changes

Since the intent behind the numerical changes isn't clear from the provided context, and test values often require precise matching, this conflict requires manual resolution to determine which values align with current test expectations.
