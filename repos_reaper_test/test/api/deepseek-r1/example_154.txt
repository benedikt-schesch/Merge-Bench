Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java code where a GruntParser is being created. The HEAD version uses a constructor with a StringReader parameter, while the other branch uses a constructor that also includes myPig as a second argument.

I need to figure out the intent of both changes. The HEAD version might be an older implementation where GruntParser only required the script. The other branch's change adds a myPig parameter, which could be a new dependency or context that's necessary for the parser to function correctly now.

Since both changes are modifying the same line, it's a conflict. But maybe the correct approach is to include both parameters if the constructor now requires them. However, I should check if the constructor actually exists with both parameters. If the myPig addition is a necessary part of the new code, then the correct resolution is to use the two-argument constructor. The HEAD version might be outdated, so the merge should take the incoming change from the branch that adds myPig. Therefore, the resolved line should be the one from the branch, combining both the StringReader and myPig.</think>
```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "dump b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
``` 

Rationale: The conflict resolution preserves both the script input (StringReader) and myPig context dependency from the branch version, which appears to be a more complete initialization pattern. The HEAD version's constructor might be outdated, as passing a Pig context (myPig) to the parser is likely important for proper configuration.
