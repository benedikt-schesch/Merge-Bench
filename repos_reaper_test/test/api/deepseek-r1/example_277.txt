Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code in question is inside a loop where they're iterating over a list of packagers. The conflict is between adding the packager 'p' to fromPkgr in HEAD and toPkgr in the other branch. 

First, I need to understand the intent of both changes. The original code in HEAD is adding each packager 'p' to fromPkgr, which is a MultiQueryPackager. But the other branch is adding them to toPkgr instead. 

Wait, that seems odd. Because the loop is iterating over the packagers from fromPkgr (since pkgs is derived from fromPkgr). If we're adding them back to fromPkgr, that might be redundant because they're already part of it. On the other hand, adding them to toPkgr makes sense if the goal is to copy the packagers from the fromPkgr to the toPkgr. 

Looking at the surrounding code, after the loop, there's a line where toPkgr is adding the isKeyWrappedList from fromPkgr. So it seems like the purpose here is to transfer some data from fromPkgr to toPkgr. Therefore, the correct change is probably adding to toPkgr, as in the second branch. The HEAD version might be a mistake because adding the same packagers back to fromPkgr doesn't make sense. 

Therefore, resolving the conflict by choosing the version that adds to toPkgr would align with the subsequent line where toPkgr is being updated. The 'pkCount' is just counting the number of packagers, which would be correct in either case, but the action should be adding to toPkgr.

So the resolved line should be ((MultiQueryPackager) toPkgr).addPackager(p);. Also, need to check if the casting is correct. Since toPkgr is presumably a MultiQueryPackager, the cast is safe here. The code after the conflict uses toPkgr.addIsKeyWrappedList, which implies that toPkgr is a MultiQueryPackager. Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the second part of the conflict.</think>
```java
        int pkCount = 0;
        if (fromPkgr instanceof MultiQueryPackager) {
            List<Packager> pkgs = ((MultiQueryPackager) fromPkgr)
                    .getPackagers();
            for (Packager p : pkgs) {
                ((MultiQueryPackager) toPkgr).addPackager(p);
                pkCount++;
            }
            toPkgr.addIsKeyWrappedList(((MultiQueryPackager) fromPkgr)
                            .getIsKeyWrappedList());
            addShiftedKeyInfoIndex(initial, current,
