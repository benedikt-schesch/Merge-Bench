Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the code snippet provided. The conflict is in the VideoFormat class between the HEAD and a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe.

In the HEAD version, there's a line declaring a serialVersionUID as 1L. The other branch doesn't have this line. The rest of the code is the same, including the comment block for the method.

The question is whether to keep the serialVersionUID or remove it. Since serialVersionUID is used for versioning in serialization, if one branch added it and the other didn't, we need to see if it's necessary.

Looking at the surrounding context, the class extends AbstractFacebookType. If the parent class (AbstractFacebookType) already defines a serialVersionUID, then maybe this line is redundant. But if not, adding it here might be intentional for serialization compatibility.

However, without knowing the content of AbstractFacebookType, it's hard to say. But in Java, if a serializable class doesn't declare serialVersionUID, it's generated automatically, which can cause issues if the class structure changes. So maybe the HEAD branch added it explicitly to avoid potential problems, while the other branch didn't have it.

Since both changes are modifying the same spot, but one adds a field and the other doesn't, we need to decide which one to keep. If the intention was to add the serialVersionUID for correctness, then keeping it makes sense. Alternatively, if the other branch removed it because it's unnecessary, but that's less likely.

The user instructions say to consider the intent and semantics. If both changes don't conflict in intent beyond this line, maybe the serialVersionUID should be kept. Unless the other branch intentionally removed it, but the commit message isn't provided. Since there's no other conflicting code, perhaps the best approach is to keep the serialVersionUID from HEAD, as it's a common practice to declare it for serializable classes.

Therefore, the resolved code should include the serialVersionUID line, merging both changes by keeping that line and the comment block from both branches. Since the comment blocks are identical, there's no conflict there. So the conflict markers can be removed, keeping the serialVersionUID declaration.</think>
