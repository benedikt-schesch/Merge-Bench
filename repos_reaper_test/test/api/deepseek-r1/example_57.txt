Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the code snippets from both branches.

In the HEAD version, there's an if statement checking if tempWhiteDeck.totalCount() is less than getRequiredWhiteCardCount(). If it is, return false. Otherwise, return true. So that's two lines: the condition and the return true.

In the other branch (5adedd2), they simplified it to a single return statement. Instead of using an if, they check if the count is greater than or equal to the required, returning that boolean directly. That's more concise.

The intent of both seems to be the same: determine if the white deck has enough cards. The HEAD uses an explicit check and returns false if not, then true. The other branch uses a one-liner returning the boolean result of the comparison.

Since both achieve the same logical outcome, the conflict can be resolved by choosing the more concise version. The single return statement is cleaner and reduces redundancy. So I'll replace the HEAD's if block with the return statement from the other branch. That should resolve the conflict without changing functionality.</think>
```java
      if (tempBlackDeck.totalCount() < MINIMUM_BLACK_CARDS) {
        return false;
      }

      final WhiteDeck tempWhiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
      return tempWhiteDeck.totalCount() >= getRequiredWhiteCardCount();
    }
  }
