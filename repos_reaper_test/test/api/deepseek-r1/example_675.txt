Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict between the HEAD version and the branch version. The main differences are in the variable type of accessToken and the placement of the closing brace and parameters for the jdbcTemplate.query method.

In the HEAD version, the closing brace for the RowMapper is on a separate line, indented, followed by the parameters account.getId() and resourceId. The variable accessToken is declared as type AccessToken. In the other branch, the closing brace is on the same line as the parameters, and the variable is of type OAuthConsumerToken.

First, I need to figure out the intent of both changes. The HEAD side is using AccessToken, while the other branch is using OAuthConsumerToken. These might be two different classes, possibly from different packages or part of a refactor. The conflict arises because both changes modify the same line, changing the type of accessToken.

I should check if OAuthConsumerToken is a subclass of AccessToken or if they are related. If they are compatible, maybe one is a more specific type. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, in the HEAD version, the RowMapper is creating AccessToken instances, which are stored in the accessTokens list. Then, accessToken is assigned from this list. If the other branch changes the type to OAuthConsumerToken, that would cause a type mismatch unless OAuthConsumerToken is a supertype or there's a conversion.

Wait, the list is of AccessToken type. So if the branch is trying to assign an AccessToken to an OAuthConsumerToken variable, that would only work if AccessToken is a subclass of OAuthConsumerToken. But if it's the other way around, it's a problem. So this could be a breaking change. Alternatively, maybe the branch is refactoring the code to use a different token type, but the RowMapper is still creating AccessToken instances. That would be a problem because you can't assign an AccessToken to an OAuthConsumerToken variable unless there's a subtype relationship.

So the conflict here is between two different types for the accessToken variable. The correct resolution depends on which type is intended. If the branch is correct in changing to OAuthConsumerToken, then the RowMapper might need to create OAuthConsumerToken instances instead. But in the provided code, the RowMapper is still creating AccessToken. That suggests that the two changes are conflicting in intent. Therefore, this is a semantic conflict that can't be automatically resolved without more information.

Alternatively, maybe the parameters after the RowMapper are formatted differently. The HEAD has the closing brace on a new line with a comma, while the branch has it on the same line. That's a formatting difference. The correct formatting would depend on the project's style guide, but since both are valid Java, maybe we can adjust the formatting to match one or the other.

But the user asked to resolve the conflict by considering the semantics. Since the variable types are conflicting, and without knowing which is correct, the safest approach is to leave the conflict as is. However, perhaps there's a way to reconcile them. Let me check again.

Wait, the HEAD version declares accessToken as AccessToken, and the branch as OAuthConsumerToken. If the branch is introducing a new type, but the list is still of AccessToken, then assigning accessTokens.get(0) to an OAuthConsumerToken variable would cause a compile error unless there's a subtype relationship. So unless OAuthConsumerToken is a superclass or interface that AccessToken implements, this would be invalid. Therefore, these two changes are conflicting in a way that can't be merged automatically without more context.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to present the conflict as unresolved because the intent is ambiguous. The user should decide which type to use. Alternatively, if there's a possibility that one of the changes is correct and the other is outdated, but without knowing, it's best to leave the conflict markers.

However, looking at the parameters after the RowMapper: in the HEAD version, the closing }, is on a separate line with a comma, and the parameters are on the next line. In the branch version, the }, is on the same line as the parameters. That's a formatting difference. Java allows both, so maybe we can choose one formatting style. But the user said to preserve spacing as is. Wait, the user said to return the entire snippet including full context as provided, making sure not to modify the context at all and preserve spacing unless resolving the conflict. But if we resolve the conflict, we have to merge the changes.

Wait, the user instructions say: if unsure or ambiguous, return the same snippet with the conflict. Otherwise, resolve it by considering intent and semantics.

So, the variable type change is a semantic conflict. The two branches are changing the type of accessToken. Unless they are compatible, this is a conflict. Since the types are different and the list is of AccessToken, assigning to OAuthConsumerToken is a type mismatch. Therefore, the correct resolution is to pick one or the other, but without knowing the intent, it's ambiguous. Hence, the conflict remains.

But perhaps the parameters after the RowMapper can be merged. The HEAD has:

				}, account.getId(), resourceId);

The branch has:

		}, account.getId(), resourceId);

The difference is in the indentation of the closing brace and comma. The HEAD has an extra tab before the }, while the branch has it at the same level as the RowMapper's closing. If that's just formatting, maybe we can adjust that. However, the user said to preserve spacing as is. So, perhaps that's part of the conflict. The two versions have different formatting for the closing brace and parameters. So merging those would require choosing one or the other. But again, that's a formatting conflict.

But the main issue is the variable type. Since both changes modify the same line (the declaration of accessToken), that's a conflict that can't be automatically resolved without knowing which type is correct. Therefore, the conflict remains, and the user should resolve it manually.

Therefore, the correct answer is to return the same snippet with the conflict markers because the intent is ambiguous.</think>
