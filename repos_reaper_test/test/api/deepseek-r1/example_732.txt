Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict between the HEAD version and the other branch. Looking at the changes, the HEAD version adds some empty lines after the closing brace of the anonymous class, while the other branch (c923751) doesn't have those lines. Then both sides have the same code for unlocking the camera settings.

So the conflict is about whether to include those extra newlines or not. Since merge conflicts often arise from whitespace changes, I need to determine if those empty lines are intentional or just formatting. If both branches are making changes around the same area, but one adds whitespace and the other doesn't, maybe the correct resolution is to keep the whitespace as per one side or the other, or perhaps it's inconsequential.

But looking at the surrounding code, after the closing }); of the anonymous class, the HEAD adds a couple of blank lines before the comment. The other branch doesn't have those lines, so the conflict is whether those blank lines exist. Since in Java, blank lines between code blocks are usually a matter of style. If both changes are part of different features or fixes, maybe the intended resolution is to keep the blank lines for readability, unless the other branch actively removed them for some reason.

But the user instructions say to think about the intent and semantics. The actual code changes (the camera unlock lines) are the same on both sides. The conflict is purely about whitespace. In such cases, it's possible that the HEAD's addition of blank lines is just formatting, and the other branch didn't touch that part. So resolving by keeping the HEAD's blank lines would make sense, as the other branch's change doesn't conflict semantically. Alternatively, if the other branch removed the blank lines intentionally, but that's unclear.

Wait, the conflict markers show that HEAD added the blank lines, and the other branch didn't have them. So when merging, if we want to preserve both changes, but since they are conflicting whitespace, we have to choose. Since the user says to preserve the context as much as possible unless there's a semantic conflict. If the blank lines don't affect functionality, maybe we should keep them. Alternatively, maybe the other branch removed them for a reason, but without more context, it's hard to tell.

But the user says if unsure, leave the conflict. However, the actual code after the conflict is the same in both branches. The only difference is the blank lines. Since the code after is the same, perhaps the resolution is to accept the HEAD's blank lines, as they are just formatting and don't affect the code. Therefore, the resolved code would include the blank lines from HEAD and then the camera unlock code from both.

So the merged code would have the blank lines from HEAD, followed by the comment and the unlock lines. So the conflict is resolved by keeping the HEAD's addition of the blank lines and discarding the other branch's removal, assuming that the other branch didn't make any changes there except possibly removing the lines. But since the other branch's code doesn't show any changes except the absence of the blank lines, perhaps it's safe to keep the blank lines. Therefore, the resolved code would be:

                    flinger.setImageBitmap(info.mThumbnail);
                    flinger.doAnimation();
                }
            });



            // Unlock camera auto settings
            mCamManager.setLockSetup(false);
            mCamManager.setStabilization(false);
        }

Because the conflict is only about the presence of the blank lines, and if there's no semantic reason to remove them, keeping them (as in HEAD) is acceptable. Alternatively, if the other branch intended to remove them, but without context, it's safer to keep both? Wait, no. The conflict is that HEAD added them and the other branch didn't. So merging would have to choose between the two. Since the user says to preserve spacing as is unless we can determine intent. If the intent is unclear, leave the conflict. But in this case, the only difference is whitespace. It's possible that one side added blank lines for readability, and the other side didn't touch that part. So the correct resolution is to keep the blank lines from HEAD, as the other branch's version doesn't have any changes except not adding them. Therefore, resolving the conflict by keeping the HEAD's lines.</think>
