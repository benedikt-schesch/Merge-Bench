Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in a Java method. The two versions are almost the same except for the line between the HEAD and the other branch. In HEAD, there's a blank line with a newline, and in the other branch, there's a line with just a space. Wait, actually, looking closer, the HEAD side has a line with a newline, and the other side has a line with a space and then a newline. So the difference is whether there's a space there or not.

But in Java, whitespace like that doesn't affect the code's functionality. So the intent of both sides is probably the same. The line between the assignment of fromPkgr and the if statement is just an empty line. One side has an empty line, the other has a line with a space. But when you merge, that space is insignificant. So the correct resolution would be to take one of them. Since in such cases, maybe the HEAD had an extra blank line, and the other side had a line with a space. But in terms of code, both result in a blank line there. Because a line with just whitespace is considered blank in Java. So merging them by keeping one of the versions would resolve the conflict. Since the conflict is only about whitespace, we can safely choose either. But perhaps the correct resolution is to have a single blank line there. Let me check the original code again.

Original HEAD has:

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
 
>>>>>>> ...

So the HEAD side has a blank line (just a newline), and the other side has a line with a single space. When rendered, both would look like a blank line. So merging them by taking either would resolve the conflict. Since the conflict is trivial whitespace, the resolution is to pick either. In such cases, maybe the correct approach is to remove the space, so just have a blank line. Therefore, the resolved code would have the blank line from HEAD. But wait, maybe the other branch added a space for some formatting reason? Or maybe it's a trailing space that's unnecessary. Since the code is in Java, trailing spaces in blank lines don't matter. So merging by taking the HEAD version (without the space) is better to avoid trailing whitespace. Therefore, the resolved code should have the blank line without the space. So in the merged code, that line would be empty. So the conflict is resolved by removing the space and keeping the blank line as in HEAD.</think>

    private void mergeOneReducePlanWithIndex(PhysicalPlan from,
            PhysicalPlan to, int initial, int current, byte mapKeyType) throws VisitorException {
        POPackage pk = (POPackage)from.getRoots().get(0);
        from.remove(pk);
        Packager fromPkgr = pk.getPkgr();

        if (!(fromPkgr instanceof MultiQueryPackager)) {
            // XXX the index of the original keyInfo map is always 0,
            // we need to shift the index so that the lookups works
            // with the new indexed key
            addShiftedKeyInfoIndex(initial, fromPkgr);
