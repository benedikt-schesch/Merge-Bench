Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java imports. Let's look at what's happening here. The HEAD version has an import for CommonHandler, and the other branch (67bcb76a) doesn't. The conflict is between these two lines.

First, I should check if these imports are necessary or if one side removed it for a reason. CommonHandler and CommonPipelineFactory are both part of the org.spout.api.protocol package. Maybe one branch added CommonHandler, and the other didn't, or perhaps one removed it.

Wait, the conflict is that HEAD added the CommonHandler import, and the other branch doesn't have it. So when merging, if both changes are compatible, we should include both. But since the conflict is only about the CommonHandler line, the other branch might have removed it. Or maybe the other branch is older and doesn't have that import yet.

But looking at the surrounding context, the imports after are CommonPipelineFactory, PortBinding, Protocol, Session, RenderMode. The order might matter, but in Java, the order of imports doesn't affect functionality, though it's common to organize them. However, in the conflict, the HEAD has the CommonHandler import, and the other branch doesn't. So the resolution would be to keep the CommonHandler import if it's still needed. But why was it removed in the other branch?

Alternatively, maybe the other branch deleted that import because it's no longer used, while the HEAD branch added it. If that's the case, we need to check if the code actually uses CommonHandler. Since the user hasn't provided the full code, it's hard to tell. But as a semantic merge, perhaps the intent of HEAD is to add the import, and the other branch didn't touch it. Wait, no—the other branch's change is removing it. Because in the conflict, the HEAD has the line, and the other branch doesn't. So the conflict arises because one side added it and the other side didn't have it. Wait, maybe the other branch is based on an older version where that import wasn't present, and the HEAD added it. So when merging, the correct resolution is to keep the CommonHandler import because the HEAD added it, and the other branch didn't remove it—it just didn't have it in their version. Therefore, the merge should include the CommonHandler import line. So the resolved code should include that line without the conflict markers. Therefore, the correct merged code would have the import for CommonHandler, followed by the CommonPipelineFactory, etc. So the conflict is resolved by accepting the HEAD's addition.</think>
