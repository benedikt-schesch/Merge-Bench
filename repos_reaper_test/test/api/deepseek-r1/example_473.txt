Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java imports section. The HEAD version has an import for org.testng.Assert and some other TestNG annotations. The other branch, a77e57e, adds an import for de.javakaffee.web.msm.BackupSessionService.SimpleFuture. 

First, I need to check if these imports are conflicting or if they can coexist. Since they're in the same import block but different classes, they might just need to be merged. The HEAD side doesn't have the SimpleFuture import, and the other side does. The rest of the imports after the conflict seem to be the same in both branches.

So the correct resolution would be to include both imports. The conflict markers should be removed, and both the Assert and SimpleFuture imports should be present. The order might matter, but since they're from different packages, arranging them alphabetically or as per the original order might be needed. Looking at the original code, the HEAD starts with org.testng imports, then the other branch adds a de.javakaffee import. But in the common part after the conflict, there are other de.javakaffee imports. So the SimpleFuture import from a77e57e should probably be placed before the other de.javakaffee imports to maintain the grouping. Wait, looking at the code:

The HEAD has:
import org.testng.Assert;
... other TestNG imports...
Then after the conflict, both sides have:
import de.javakaffee.web.msm.BackupSessionTask.BackupResult;
... other de.javakaffee imports...

The conflicting part is that the a77e57e adds an import for SimpleFuture from BackupSessionService. So the correct merge would be to include the SimpleFuture import along with the existing ones. The order in the conflict is that the HEAD doesn't have it, and the other branch adds it. So the resolved code should have both the Assert import from HEAD and the SimpleFuture import from the other branch. But how are they ordered? The original code in HEAD has the TestNG imports first, then the de.javakaffee ones. The other branch adds the SimpleFuture import in the same section. So in the merged code, the SimpleFuture import should come after the TestNG imports but before the other de.javakaffee imports. Let me check the code again.

Original HEAD has:

import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.AfterMethod;
import org.testng.annotations.BeforeMethod;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

Then the other branch adds:

import de.javakaffee.web.msm.BackupSessionService.SimpleFuture;

Then both have the rest of the de.javakaffee imports. So in the resolved code, the SimpleFuture import should be placed after the TestNG imports and before the BackupSessionTask import. Therefore, the correct merged imports would be:

import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.AfterMethod;
import org.testng.annotations.BeforeMethod;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

import de.javakaffee.web.msm.BackupSessionService.SimpleFuture;
import de.javakaffee.web.msm.BackupSessionTask.BackupResult;
... etc.

So the conflict is simply adding an import from one branch and keeping the existing ones from the other. Since there's no overlap (they're different imports), the merge should combine both. Therefore, the resolved code would include both the Assert and SimpleFuture imports, ordered appropriately with the TestNG ones first, followed by the de.javakaffee ones. There's no ambiguity here; both imports are needed and don't conflict semantically. So the answer is to remove the conflict markers and include both imports.</think>
