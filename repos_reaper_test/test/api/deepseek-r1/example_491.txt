Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let's look at the conflicting parts. The HEAD version uses this.mBitmapTexture, while the other branch uses this.mBitmapTextureAtlas. 

First, I should check if these are different variables or if one was renamed. Maybe the project switched from using a single texture to a texture atlas. If both variables exist and serve different purposes, that's a problem. But if one was a replacement for the other, then we need to pick the correct one.

Looking at the surrounding code, the SpriteGroup constructor probably takes a texture or texture atlas. The variable names suggest that mBitmapTextureAtlas is a more recent change, perhaps part of a refactor to use texture atlases instead of individual textures. If the other parts of the codebase use TextureAtlas now, then the correct choice is mBitmapTextureAtlas. But if HEAD is the newer change, maybe mBitmapTexture is correct.

But without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in many game engines, a SpriteGroup might be more likely to use a texture atlas for efficiency. So the branch using mBitmapTextureAtlas is probably the right one. Therefore, I should resolve the conflict by choosing the latter option.</think>
```java
				new DelayModifier(2),
				new AlphaModifier(1.5f, 1, 0),
				new AlphaModifier(1.5f, 0, 1)
		);

		final SpriteGroup spriteGroup = new SpriteGroup(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, SPRITE_COUNT);
		for(int i = 0; i < SPRITE_COUNT; i++) {
			final Sprite face = new Sprite((CAMERA_WIDTH - 32) * this.mRandom.nextFloat(), (CAMERA_HEIGHT - 32) * this.mRandom.nextFloat(), this.mFaceTextureRegion);
			face.registerEntityModifier(faceEntityModifier.clone());

			spriteGroup.attachChild(face);
```
