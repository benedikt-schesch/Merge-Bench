Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. So, looking at the code snippet, the conflict is in the buildPlan method. The HEAD version has a line where they create a new PigContext instance and assign it to pigContext, while the other side (from commit 1488b22) doesn't have that line. Then, both sides proceed to create a LogicalPlanBuilder using pigContext.

The problem here is that the incoming change (from 1488b22) removed the PigContext creation, but the HEAD added it. If we just take one side, we might end up with an error because pigContext might not be initialized. Wait, in the HEAD version, they create pigContext and then pass it to LogicalPlanBuilder. In the other branch, maybe pigContext is already defined somewhere else? Or maybe it's a parameter that's being removed?

But looking at the code around the conflict, in the HEAD version, the line PigContext pigContext = new PigContext(...); is added. The other side doesn't have that line. So when merging, if we take the HEAD's addition, then the code will have pigContext initialized. If we take the other side, pigContext might not exist, leading to a compile error because it's used in the builder constructor.

Wait, but in the code after the conflict, both sides have the line LogicalPlanBuilder builder = new LogicalPlanBuilder(pigContext); So if the other side (1488b22) removed the PigContext creation, then where is pigContext coming from? Maybe in their version, pigContext is a parameter to the method or a field in the class. Let me check the method signature.

The method is public LogicalPlan buildPlan(String query, ClassLoader cldr). There's no pigContext parameter here. So if the other side removed the line that creates pigContext, then pigContext would not be declared in this method, leading to a compilation error. Therefore, the conflict arises because one side adds the PigContext initialization, and the other side removes it. But since the other side's code would result in an undeclared variable, that can't be correct. Therefore, maybe the correct resolution is to keep the PigContext initialization from HEAD. Alternatively, perhaps the other side moved the PigContext creation elsewhere or made it a field.

But without more context, it's hard to say. The user provided only this snippet. In the current code, the conflict is between adding PigContext and not having it. If the incoming branch (1488b22) removed that line, but the code still uses pigContext in the builder, that would be an error. Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the line from HEAD. Alternatively, maybe the other side has a different way of initializing pigContext, but in the given code, there's no evidence of that. Therefore, the merge should keep the PigContext creation from HEAD to avoid the variable being undefined.</think>

    }

    public LogicalPlan buildPlan(String query, ClassLoader cldr) {
        LogicalPlanBuilder.classloader = cldr;
        PigContext pigContext = new PigContext(ExecType.LOCAL, new Properties());
        LogicalPlanBuilder builder = new LogicalPlanBuilder(pigContext); //

        try {
            LogicalPlan lp = builder.parse("Test-Plan-Builder",
                                           query,
