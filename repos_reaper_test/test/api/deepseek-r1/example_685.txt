<think>
Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The code in question is a log message that's part of a Java application. The conflict is between two versions of the same log statement. I need to figure out how to merge them correctly while preserving the intent of both changes.

Looking at the HEAD version, the message says "The following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for resource access permissions or node ownership during deployment." Then it mentions that node access rights aren't identical because of missing permissions/ownerships. The missing principals are joined with ", ".

The other branch (from commit 83418dbbb7) changes "resource access permissions" to "grants" and "permissions/ownerships" to "grants/ownerships". Also, it uses a stream to sort the missing principals and joins them with "\n\t" instead of a comma and space. The exclamation mark at the end of the second line is added here.

So, the main differences are the terminology (permissions vs. grants) and the formatting of the missing principals list. The HEAD uses a comma-separated list, while the other branch uses a sorted list with each entry on a new line and indented.

I need to decide which changes are semantic improvements and which are conflicting. The term "grants" might be more accurate in the context of access control, as grants refer to specific permissions given. Also, sorting the principals and formatting them each on a new line could improve readability, especially if there are many entries. The exclamation mark adds emphasis, which might be intentional.

However, changing "resource access permissions" to "grants" could be a terminology update that's important for consistency with the documentation or codebase. Similarly, sorting the principals and formatting them as a list is a functional change, not just stylistic.

To resolve this, I should combine both changes. Use "grants" terminology from the second branch, keep the exclamation mark, and use the sorted stream with the newline separator. That way, the message is both terminologically correct and the list is more readable.

So, the merged code would take the message from the second branch for the lines about grants and ownerships, and use the stream to collect and sort the missing principals. The rest of the context (like the URL and the structure) remains the same, as both versions are similar there.

I should check if the comma in the URL line is present in both. The HEAD version has it in the string, and the other branch uses a single quote around 'pre-data-deploy.conf' but the URL is the same. Wait, in the HEAD, the line after the conflict is:

+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://...\">pre-deploy.conf</a> and re-importing.";

But in the other branch, the line is:

+ "\tConsider adding these principals to your 'pre-data-deploy.conf' (see https://...) and re-importing.\n"

Wait, that's part of the conflict. Wait, looking back at the original code, the conflict markers are in the logger.info section. Let me check again.

The code after the conflict markers:

The HEAD has:

+ "\tBecause of these missing permissions/ownerships, node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported.\n\n"
+ "\t" + String.join(", ",  missingPrincipals)

The other branch has:

+ "\tBecause of these missing grants/ownerships, node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported!\n\n"
+ "\t" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))

Then the line after that in both is similar, but in the HEAD, the URL is part of an <a> tag, while in the other branch, it's written as 'pre-data-deploy.conf' with the URL in parentheses. Wait, no—that part is actually outside the conflict. Let me check the entire code snippet again.

Wait, the code given starts with:

>>>>>>> 83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965
					+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf\">pre-data-deploy.conf</a> and re-importing.";

Then the logger.info block has the conflict between HEAD and the other branch.

Wait, no, the first part is part of the 'text' variable, and the logger.info is part of the code. The conflict is within the logger.info call. Let me look again.

The code snippet is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
					+ "\tThe following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for resource access permissions or node ownership during deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of these missing permissions/ownerships, node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported.\n\n"
					+ "\t" + String.join(", ",  missingPrincipals)
=======
					+ "\tThe following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of these missing grants/ownerships, node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported!\n\n"
					+ "\t" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
>>>>>>> 83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965
					+ "\n\n\tConsider adding these principals to your 'pre-data-deploy.conf' (see https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf) and re-importing.\n"

Wait, in the merged code after the conflict, the line that starts with "\n\n\tConsider adding..." is part of both versions. But in the HEAD version, that line is not present because the conflict is only in the three lines above. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the code.

Looking at the full code:

The logger.info has several lines. The conflict is between the lines starting with "\tThe following...", "\tBecause...", and "\t" + missingPrincipals...

Then, after that, both versions have a line that says:

+ "\n\n\tConsider adding these principals to your 'pre-data-deploy.conf' (see https://...) and re-importing.\n"

Wait, but in the initial code given, after the conflict markers, there's:

					+ "\n\n\tConsider adding these principals to your 'pre-data-deploy.conf' (see https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf) and re-importing.\n"
					+ "###############################################################################"
			);

So, the line after the conflict is part of both versions? Or is that line part of the HEAD or the other branch?

Wait, the code structure is:

After the conflict markers (<<<<<<< HEAD, =======, >>>>>>> 83418dbbb7...), the line that starts with "+ "\n\n\tConsider adding..." is part of both versions. Because both versions have this line, but perhaps the HEAD version has a different way of presenting the URL (as an HTML link) versus the other branch which has it in parentheses with 'pre-data-deploy.conf' in quotes.

Wait, looking back at the code snippet provided by the user:

The very first line after the conflict marker (>>>>>>> 83418dbbb7...) is:

					+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf\">pre-data-deploy.conf</a> and re-importing.";

Then, the logger.info block starts. Then, within the logger.info, the conflict is between the HEAD and the other branch. The line after the conflict in the logger.info is:

					+ "\n\n\tConsider adding these principals to your 'pre-data-deploy.conf' (see https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf) and re-importing.\n"

Wait, that seems conflicting. The initial line (before the logger.info) has the HTML link, but the line in the logger.info (after the conflict) has the plain text with the URL. So perhaps the user is showing two different parts of the code: the first line is part of a different variable (maybe 'text'), and the logger.info is part of the log message.

But according to the code provided, after resolving the conflict in the logger.info, the line that starts with "\n\n\tConsider..." is part of both versions. However, in the HEAD version, that line may not exist because the same information is already in the 'text' variable. Wait, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the code as given by the user includes:

First, the 'text' variable is built with the line:

+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf\">pre-deployconf</a> and re-importing.";

Then, the logger.info is called with a multi-line string. The conflict is within the logger.info string. The conflicting lines are the three lines:

<<<<<<< HEAD
					+ "\tThe following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for resource access permissions or node ownership during deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of these missing permissions/ownerships, node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported.\n\n"
					+ "\t" + String.join(", ",  missingPrincipals)
=======
					+ "\tThe following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of these missing grants/ownerships, node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported!\n\n"
					+ "\t" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
>>>>>>> 83418dbbb7...

Then, after the conflict, both versions have the line:

					+ "\n\n\tConsider adding these principals to your 'pre-data-deploy.conf' (see https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf) and re-importing.\n"

But this line in the logger.info is different from the 'text' variable line. The 'text' variable uses an HTML link, while the logger.info line uses plain text with the URL. This might be a mistake, but perhaps in the HEAD version, the logger.info message's "Consider adding..." line is different from the other branch.

But according to the code provided, after the conflict markers, both versions have that line. So, that line is part of both versions, but with different formatting. Wait, no—the user's code snippet shows that after the conflict in the logger.info, the line is:

					+ "\n\n\tConsider adding these principals to your 'pre-data-deploy.conf' (see https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf) and re-importing.\n"

Which seems to come from the other branch, as the HEAD version's text variable has the HTML link. But perhaps in the HEAD version, the logger.info doesn't include that line, while in the other branch, it does. This is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the line after the conflict is part of the code outside the conflict, but the user included it in the snippet. To resolve the conflict, I need to focus on the three conflicting lines and then ensure the rest is merged correctly.

So, merging the three lines:

1. The message about missing principals: use "grants or node ownership" from the other branch, as it's more precise.
2. The reason line: use "grants/ownerships" and the exclamation mark for emphasis.
3. The missingPrincipals line: use the sorted stream with newline and tab for better readability.

Then, the line after that in both versions is "\n\n\tConsider adding...", but in the other branch, it's using single quotes and the URL in parentheses. However, the initial 'text' variable in the code (from the other branch's commit) uses an HTML link. But in the logger.info, both versions might have this line. Wait, but in the code provided, after resolving the conflict in the three lines, the next line is:

+ "\n\n\tConsider adding these principals to your 'pre-data-deploy.conf' (see https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf) and re-importing.\n"

Which seems to be part of both versions. But in the HEAD version, perhaps this line is not present, and the 'text' variable is built with the HTML link. However, the code provided shows that after the conflict markers, the line is present. So maybe this line is part of both versions but differs between them.

Wait, looking again at the original code:

The user provided the code snippet as:

<<<<<<< HEAD
					+ "\tThe following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for resource access permissions or node ownership during deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of these missing permissions/ownerships, node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported.\n\n"
					+ "\t" + String.join(", ",  missingPrincipals)
=======
					+ "\tThe following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of these missing grants/ownerships, node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported!\n\n"
					+ "\t" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
>>>>>>> 83418dbbb7...
					+ "\n\n\tConsider adding these principals to your 'pre-data-deploy.conf' (see https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf) and re-importing.\n"
					+ "###############################################################################"
			);

So, after the conflict markers, there's a line that starts with + "\n\n\tConsider adding...", which is outside the conflict. Therefore, this line is part of both versions but is not conflicting. Wait, no—the conflict is only between the three lines. The line after is part of both versions but is actually the same in both. Or maybe in one version it's part of the logger.info and in the other it's part of the 'text' variable. But according to the code structure, the 'text' variable is assigned before the logger.info is called. So perhaps the line after the conflict is part of the logger.info message in both versions.

In any case, the main conflict is in the three lines. The rest of the code is the same in both versions. So, merging the three lines as discussed, combining the terminology changes and the formatting of the missing principals.

So the resolved lines would be:

					+ "\tThe following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of these missing grants/ownerships, node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported!\n\n"
					+ "\t" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))

This combines the better terminology and the improved formatting of the list. The rest of the lines (like the "Consider adding..." part) are part of both versions, so they should remain as they are.

Therefore, the final merged code should include the changes from both branches where possible, combining the intent of clearer terminology and better list presentation.</think>
