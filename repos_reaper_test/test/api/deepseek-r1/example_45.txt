Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at what's going on here.

The conflict is between two methods: getCustomDeckIds in HEAD and getCardcastDeckIds in the other branch. Both are getter methods returning a Set, but the names and the variables they return are different. The HEAD version uses customDecksIds, and the other branch uses cardcastDeckIds.

Hmm, the method names suggest they're related to deck IDs, but "custom" vs "Cardcast" might indicate different sources or types of decks. Maybe the project now supports both types, and both getters are needed. Alternatively, perhaps one was a renaming, but the variable names are different too.

Wait, if it's a renaming, the variable names should match. But here, the variables are customDecksIds vs cardcastDeckIds. That suggests they are separate variables. So maybe both methods should exist. But in the code, only one method is present in each branch. The conflict is because both added a method in the same spot.

So the correct resolution would be to keep both methods. But I need to check if the surrounding code allows that. Looking at the context, the methods are in a class, and Java allows multiple methods with different names. So the conflict is because both branches added a method with different names in the same location.

Therefore, the solution is to include both methods, one after the other, without conflict markers. Wait, but the conflict is between the two method declarations. The original code had one method in each branch. So merging them would require adding both methods.

Wait, no. The conflict is in the same line. The code before the conflict is the updateGameSettings method, then the conflict is between two different getter methods. So in HEAD, after updateGameSettings, there's getCustomDeckIds, and in the other branch, getCardcastDeckIds. Since they're different methods, the correct resolution is to keep both, but the conflict markers are showing that they were added at the same position.

But in Git, if two branches modify the same part of the file, it's a conflict. Here, both added a method in the same spot. So the user needs to decide whether to keep both or choose one. But the user is asking for a semantic merge, considering the intent.

If the intent is that both methods are needed (e.g., the class now has both custom decks and Cardcast decks), then both should be kept. Alternatively, if one was a rename, but the variables are different, that's not the case here.

Looking at the variable names: customDecksIds vs cardcastDeckIds. These are different fields. So the class probably has both sets of IDs now. Therefore, both getter methods are valid and should be present.

So the resolved code should include both methods. Therefore, the conflict markers should be removed, and both methods should be present in the code.

Wait, but the original conflict is between the two methods. So in the original code, after updateGameSettings, one branch added getCustomDeckIds, and the other added getCardcastDeckIds. So when merging, Git sees that both added a method at the same spot, leading to a conflict. The correct resolution is to include both methods, one after the other.

But the user's example shows that the methods are in the same location. So in the merged code, both methods should be present. Therefore, the resolved code would have both methods:

public Set<Integer> getCustomDeckIds() {
    return customDecksIds;
}

public Set<String> getCardcastDeckIds() {
    return cardcastDeckIds;
}

But I need to check the data types. HEAD's method returns Set<Integer>, and the other branch returns Set<String>. That's a significant difference. So the variables are of different types. Therefore, these are two separate methods, and both should be kept.

Thus, the conflict is resolved by keeping both methods, removing the conflict markers, and ensuring both are present in the code.</think>
```java
  public void updateGameSettings(final GameOptions newOptions) {
    this.options.update(newOptions);
    notifyGameOptionsChanged();
  }

  public Set<Integer> getCustomDeckIds() {
    return customDecksIds;
  }

  public Set<String> getCardcastDeckIds() {
    return cardcastDeckIds;
  }
