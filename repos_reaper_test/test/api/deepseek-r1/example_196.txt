Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflicting code is in the if-else block where they're setting className based on funcSpec. The HEAD version uses getClassNameFromSpec(funcSpec) and getClassNameFromSpec(alias), while the other branch uses funcSpec.getClassName() and FuncSpec.getClassNameFromSpec(alias). 

Hmm, I need to figure out the intent here. Both sides are trying to get the class name, but in different ways. The HEAD version seems to have a helper method getClassNameFromSpec that takes either a funcSpec or an alias. The other branch is calling a method directly on funcSpec, funcSpec.getClassName(), and then using a static method from FuncSpec for the alias case.

Wait, maybe the other branch's approach is more object-oriented, calling a method on the funcSpec instance, while the HEAD uses a utility method. The else clause in HEAD uses the same helper with the alias, while the other branch uses a static method. 

Are these two approaches compatible? If FuncSpec has a static method getClassNameFromSpec that takes an alias, and the instance method getClassName() returns the correct value, then combining both might be possible. So, in the if block, using funcSpec.getClassName() from the other branch, and in the else, using the static method FuncSpec.getClassNameFromSpec(alias). 

Wait, but the HEAD's else clause uses getClassNameFromSpec(alias), which might be a different method. If the static method exists in FuncSpec, then the other branch's else is correct. But if the HEAD's method is a different helper, maybe in the current class, then there's a conflict. 

But since the user wants to resolve based on intent, maybe the correct approach is to use the instance method when funcSpec is available (as in the other branch's if block) and the static method for the else case. The HEAD's else uses a method that might not exist if it's supposed to be a static call. 

So combining both changes: in the if block, take the other branch's className = funcSpec.getClassName(); and in the else, take the other branch's else which is className = FuncSpec.getClassNameFromSpec(alias);. That way, when funcSpec is present, it uses its method, and when not, uses the static method from FuncSpec. 

But wait, what if the HEAD's getClassNameFromSpec is a method in the current class that does something different? The conflict arises because the two branches are using different approaches. However, without more context, maybe the other branch's approach is more correct, assuming that FuncSpec has the appropriate methods. 

Alternatively, maybe the intended resolution is to use the instance method when possible (funcSpec.getClassName()) and the static method when not. So the resolved code would be:

if (funcSpec != null) {
    className = funcSpec.getClassName();
} else {
    className = FuncSpec.getClassNameFromSpec(alias);
}

That way, both changes are incorporated. The conflict markers can be removed, and the code uses the methods from each branch appropriately. 

I think that makes sense semantically. Both sides are trying to retrieve the class name, but one uses an instance method and the other a static method depending on the presence of funcSpec. So the resolved code would merge both changes without conflict.</think>

        if (funcSpec != null) {
            className = funcSpec.getClassName();
        }else{
            className = FuncSpec.getClassNameFromSpec(alias);
        }
        return resolveClassName(className);
    }
