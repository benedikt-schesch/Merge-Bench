Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The problem is in the logging statement when there's an IllegalArgumentException. The HEAD version uses rawValue.asString() directly, while the other branch uses jsonObject.getString(facebookFieldName). 

Hmm, the goal here is to log the string that couldn't be mapped to the enum. Both sides are trying to provide the problematic string. The HEAD version gets it from rawValue, which is probably the parsed JSON value. The other branch is getting it from a specific field in a JSON object using facebookFieldName. 

Wait, maybe the conflict arises because one branch is using a more direct approach (rawValue.asString()) and the other is extracting from a specific field. But why would they differ? Maybe in one context, rawValue is the correct source, and in another, it's necessary to get it from the jsonObject using a field name. 

But looking at the surrounding code, there's a variable called rawValue, which is being used in the try block as rawValue.asString(). Then, after the catch block, there's a line that does String rawValueAsString = jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue);. So rawValue is a JSON node or similar, and asString() gives its string value.

The other side uses jsonObject.getString(facebookFieldName), which implies that the string is being fetched from a specific field in a JSON object. But in the HEAD version, maybe the code was refactored to use rawValue directly instead of referring to the jsonObject and a field name. 

If the code in HEAD is more recent, perhaps they simplified it by using rawValue.asString(), making the other branch's approach obsolete. Or maybe the other branch is adding a feature where the field name is important. But without more context, it's tricky.

Wait, the line after the conflict uses rawValueAsString, which is derived from rawValue via jsonHelper. So the code later uses rawValue. That suggests that rawValue is the correct source. The other branch's use of jsonObject.getString(facebookFieldName) might be from an older version where the field name was necessary, but perhaps in the current code, rawValue already contains the correct string. 

So resolving this conflict would involve choosing which string to log. If both changes are trying to log the same value but in different ways, maybe the HEAD version is correct. Alternatively, maybe the other branch has a fix where using the field name is necessary because rawValue isn't giving the correct string. 

But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, considering that the line after the conflict uses rawValue to get the string, maybe the HEAD version is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the other branch is correct because facebookFieldName is needed to extract the right value from the jsonObject. 

Wait, the error message is about not being able to map the string to the enum. The string in question should be the one that was attempted. In the try block, they're doing Enum.valueOf(enumType, rawValue.asString()), so the rawValue's string is the one being parsed. Therefore, if that's causing an exception, the correct value to log is rawValue.asString(), because that's what was used in the Enum.valueOf call. 

The other branch's code is logging jsonObject.getString(facebookFieldName), which might be a different value. That could be a mistake. For example, if the code was refactored to use rawValue instead of directly accessing the jsonObject, then the other branch's code is outdated. 

Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the HEAD version, which logs the actual string that caused the problem. The other branch's code might be logging a different field, which could be incorrect. So the resolved code should use rawValue.asString() in the log message.</think>
```java
      Class<? extends Enum> enumType = type.asSubclass(Enum.class);
      try {
        return Enum.valueOf(enumType, rawValue.asString());
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException iae) {
        if (MAPPER_LOGGER.isDebugEnabled()) {
          MAPPER_LOGGER.debug(format("Cannot map string %s to enum %s", rawValue.asString(), enumType.getName()));
        }
      }
    }

    String rawValueAsString = jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue);
