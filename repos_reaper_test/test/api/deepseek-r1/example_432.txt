Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict between the HEAD branch and another branch. The HEAD adds an else-if clause checking if the item is a String containing "customization" and then calls showCustomizeDialog(). The other branch doesn't have this clause. 

First, I need to understand what both sides are trying to do. The existing code handles when the item is a String with "add_source", showing a dialog. The HEAD adds another condition for "customization", which probably introduces a new feature or option. The other branch might be removing that condition, maybe because it's outdated or a different approach was taken.

But since the user asked to resolve based on intent and semantics, I should check if both conditions can coexist. The "add_source" and "customization" are different strings, so both else-if blocks can be present without conflict. It's possible that the HEAD added a new feature, and the other branch didn't touch that part. So the merge should include both conditions. 

Wait, the conflict is because one branch added the else-if and the other didn't. If the other branch (308db82) is deleting that else-if, maybe there was a reason. But without more context, it's hard to tell. If the user wants to keep both changes, the correct resolution is to include the HEAD's addition. Alternatively, if the other branch intentionally removed it, maybe it's a conflict. But since the user instructions say to resolve if possible, and the intent isn't ambiguous, I should keep the HEAD's change. So the resolved code would have both else-if blocks.</think>

                    } else {
                        VideoUtils.playVideo(new WeakReference<Activity>(getActivity()), (Video) item);
                    }
                } else if (item instanceof String && ((String) item).contains(getString(R.string.add_source))) {
                    showAddSourceDialog();
                } else if (item instanceof String && ((String) item).contains(getString(R.string.customization))) {
                    showCustomizeDialog();
                }
            }
        };
    }
