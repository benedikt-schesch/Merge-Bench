Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. So the code snippet shows two versions of a method in Java. The conflict is between the HEAD version and another commit.

Looking at the method `isNotEqualTo`, the HEAD version has the opening curly brace on the same line as the method declaration: `public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected){`, while the other commit has it with a space before the brace: `public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected) {`.

The difference here is just code styleâ€”whether to put the opening brace on the same line or with a space. Since both versions are functionally the same, the intent is identical. The semantic meaning doesn't change. The correct resolution would be to choose one style. But since the surrounding code might have a consistent style, I should check the context.

Looking at the surrounding code, the method above `assertEqualTo` has the brace on the same line in the HEAD version. Wait, the code before the conflict shows `longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);` and the method before that probably has the same style. If the project uses the style where braces are on the same line without a space, then the HEAD version is correct. But the other commit adds a space for consistency maybe.

Wait, actually, in Java, the common convention is to have the opening brace on the same line as the method declaration, with a space before it. So maybe the second version with the space is the correct one. But the HEAD version might be part of a codebase that doesn't use that space. However, since the conflict is only about the brace placement, and both are syntactically correct, the merge should pick one. Since the two changes are conflicting in style, but the rest of the code is the same, the correct resolution would be to take one of the versions. But without more context, perhaps the intended resolution is to have the space, as that's a common Java style. Alternatively, if the existing code in the file uses no space, then HEAD is correct. But the user hasn't provided more context. However, since the conflict is just about the brace, and the change in the other commit is adding a space, maybe the correct resolution is to go with the version that adds the space for consistency with standard Java conventions. Therefore, the resolved method should have the space. So the merged code would take the second version, keeping the space. The rest of the code remains the same. The conflict markers are removed, and the correct method declaration is chosen.</think>
```java
    longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

  public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected) {
    longs.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```
