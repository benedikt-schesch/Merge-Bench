Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The code in question is a Java snippet with a conflict on the line where the boolean array 'inner' is initialized. The HEAD version has `boolean[] inner = {false};` and the other branch has the same line but with a trailing space: `boolean[] inner = {false}; `. 

First, I need to determine if there's a semantic difference here. The trailing space is a whitespace change, which typically doesn't affect the code's functionality. Java ignores trailing spaces in such initializations. So, the intent of both branches is the same: create a boolean array with a single 'false' value.

Since the conflict is purely about whitespace and doesn't change the code's meaning, the correct resolution is to pick either version. However, it's common practice to remove unnecessary trailing spaces for code cleanliness. But the user instructed to preserve context and spacing as is unless there's a semantic conflict. Wait, but the user said to think about the intent and semantics. Since the trailing space doesn't affect semantics, maybe the conflict is trivial. But the user also says if unsure or if ambiguous, leave the conflict. But in this case, the conflict is a whitespace difference. 

The user's instruction says to return the resolved snippet without conflict if the intent is clear. Since both sides are setting the same value, just with a space, it's safe to resolve by choosing either. But maybe the correct approach is to remove the conflict and take one of the versions, perhaps the one without the trailing space as it's cleaner. Alternatively, check if the trailing space is part of the project's coding style. But since we don't have that context, we have to assume it's a trivial difference.

Therefore, resolving the conflict by taking either side is acceptable. Since HEAD is the current branch, maybe that's preferred, but the trailing space might be an accidental addition. However, the commit message from the other branch (88ae4a5) might have introduced it intentionally, but without more context, it's hard to tell. But semantically, both lines are the same. So the merge conflict can be resolved by keeping one of the lines, removing the conflict markers. 

So the resolved code would have the line `boolean[] inner = {false};` without the trailing space, as that's the HEAD version. The trailing space in the other branch is likely insignificant.</think>

        Packager pkgr = new Packager();
        pkg.setPkgr(pkgr);
        pkgr.setKeyType(DataType.CHARARRAY);
        pkg.setNumInps(1);
        boolean[] inner = {false};
        pkgr.setInner(inner);
        mro.reducePlan.add(pkg);

        // Lets start building the plan which will have the sort
        // for the foreach
