Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The HEAD version has "smsReportDelivery" and the other branch has "messageResultsAPIEnable". Both are boolean settings retrieved from the same settings object. The key is to determine if these are two different settings that should both be included or if they're conflicting names for the same thing.

Since the variable names are different (smsReportDelivery vs messageResultsAPIEnable), they probably represent separate features. The user might have added one in each branch. So, the correct resolution is to keep both lines. That way, both settings are read from the configuration. I should remove the conflict markers and place both lines one after the other, preserving the order as per the original branches. Check the surrounding code for any possible duplicates or logical issues, but in this case, they seem distinct. So the merged code should include both lines without conflict.</think>
```java
        enableBlacklist = settings.getBoolean("EnableBlacklist", false);
        enableWhitelist = settings.getBoolean("EnableWhitelist", false);
        enableLog = settings.getBoolean("EnableLog", false);
        batteryLevel = settings.getInt("BatteryLevel", 0);
        alertPhoneNumber = settings.getString("AlertPhoneNumber", "");
        smsReportDelivery = settings.getBoolean("SmsReportDelivery", false);
        messageResultsAPIEnable = settings.getBoolean("MessageResultsAPIEnable", false);
    }
