Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the two versions.

In the HEAD version, the method signature is:
public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, CommandMetadata command, UsagePrinter out) {

And in the other branch (a64795...), the method has an extra parameter: String commandName. The signature there is:
public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, String commandName, CommandMetadata command, UsagePrinter out)

Wait, the first method in the context calls usage with programName, groupName, commandName, command, and a new UsagePrinter. So that's five arguments. The HEAD version's method has four parameters (missing commandName), but the other branch's method has five parameters including commandName. That's a problem because the existing code is trying to call a method with five parameters, but if we take the HEAD version, that method only has four parameters. That would cause a compile error.

So the correct resolution is to keep the method with five parameters, including commandName. Because the existing code in the first method is passing commandName as the third argument. Therefore, the version from the a64795 branch is the correct one. The HEAD version is missing the commandName parameter, which would break the method call. Therefore, the conflict should be resolved by taking the version from the a64795 branch, which includes the commandName parameter. So the merged method should have all five parameters.</think>
```java
    public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, String commandName, CommandMetadata command, StringBuilder out)
    {
        usage(programName, groupName, commandName, command, new UsagePrinter(out, columnSize));
    }

    public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, String commandName, CommandMetadata command, UsagePrinter out)
    {
        //
        // NAME
        //
        out.append("NAME").newline();
```
