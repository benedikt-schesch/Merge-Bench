Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java imports. The HEAD version adds an import for OutputStream, while the other branch doesn't have it. The surrounding context includes other IO and network imports.

First, I need to determine if both changes can be combined without issues. The HEAD adds an import for OutputStream, which is part of java.io. The other branch doesn't have that import. Since OutputStream is a commonly used class in Java IO, it's possible that the code in the HEAD branch uses it, and the other branch might not have any changes related to that import.

Since the two changes are adding an import in one branch and not touching it in the other, the correct resolution would be to keep both. However, in the conflict markers, the HEAD has the OutputStream import, and the other side doesn't. So merging them would just include the OutputStream import. There's no overlap or duplication here. The other side isn't removing it; they just didn't add it. So the resolved code should include the OutputStream import from HEAD. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by keeping the OutputStream import line, removing the conflict markers.</think>
