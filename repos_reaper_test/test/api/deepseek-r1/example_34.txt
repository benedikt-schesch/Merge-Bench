Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java imports. The HEAD version imports Vector3 from org.spout.math.vector, while the other branch imports it from org.spout.api.math and also adds an import for Region from org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.

First, I need to figure out the intent of both changes. The incoming branch (cc07030) is adding an import for Region, which is part of the same package as Chunk and Block, so that makes sense. Also, it's changing the Vector3 import from math.vector to api.math. Maybe there was a package relocation. The HEAD side might have an older version where Vector3 was in a different package.

To resolve this, we should keep both the Region import and the correct Vector3 import. Since the other branch's Vector3 path is under org.spout.api, which seems more consistent with the other imports like WorldSource, LoadOption, etc., that's probably the correct one. So we should take both changes: add the Region import and use the api.math Vector3.

So the resolved imports would include all the existing ones from both sides, making sure there are no duplicates. The order might not matter, but it's good to keep related packages together. So the final imports should be:

import org.spout.api.geo.LoadOption;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.WorldSource;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Block;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.util.StringUtil;

That way, both the added Region and the corrected Vector3 import are included, resolving the conflict without issues.</think>
```java
import org.spout.api.geo.LoadOption;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.WorldSource;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Block;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.util.StringUtil;

/**
 * Represents a position in a World
 */
```

The resolution preserves both semantic changes:
1. Keeps the `Region` import added by the incoming branch
2. Uses the `org.spout.api.math.Vector3` import from the incoming branch which appears to be a package relocation (more consistent with other `org.spout.api` imports)
3. Maintains all original context and spacing
4. Removes duplicate Vector3 import while preserving both branches' essential changes
