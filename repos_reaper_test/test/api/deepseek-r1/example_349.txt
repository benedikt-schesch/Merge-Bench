Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The code in question is the toString method, and there's a conflict between the HEAD version and the branch version. 

Looking at the changes, both sides are trying to check if the application is running as a GraalVM native image. The HEAD version directly uses the string literals for the system property key and value. The other side (from commit 2a9778c) uses constants PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY and PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME instead. 

So the main difference is whether to use string literals or constants. Using constants is generally better for maintainability because if the property names change, you only have to update the constants instead of every occurrence. The branch version is likely introducing these constants to adhere to DRY principles or to centralize configuration.

I need to check if the constants are defined somewhere else in the code. If they exist, then using the constants is the right choice. Since the user provided only this snippet, I have to assume that the constants PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY and PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME are properly declared in the class. The HEAD version might have been using literals before, and the branch is refactoring to use constants. 

Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the branch's version that uses the constants. This maintains the intent of both changes: checking the image code property and appending "-graalvm" when appropriate, but in a cleaner way with constants. 

So, I'll replace the conflict markers with the branch's code, keeping the constants. Also, I need to preserve the spacing and syntax. The code after resolution should use the constants instead of the string literals.</think>
```java
    }

    public String toString() {
      // When running the application as a native image, append `-graalvm` to the
      // version.
      String imageCode = System.getProperty(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY);
      if (imageCode != null && imageCode.equals(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME)) {
        String[] tokens = versionString.split(" ");
        if (tokens.length > 0 && tokens[0].startsWith("gl-java")) {
          tokens[0] += "-graalvm";
          return Joiner.on(" ").join(tokens);
        }
```
