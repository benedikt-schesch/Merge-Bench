Okay, let me look at this merge conflict. The code has a conflict between the HEAD and the other branch. In the HEAD version, they set 'key = pkgr.getKey(k);' and then in the other branch, they added 'keyWritable = k;'. 

The goal here is to merge both changes. Since they are in different lines but within the same block, maybe both lines should be included. The conflict markers are around these two lines. So the correct resolution would be to keep both assignments. The 'key' is being set using pkgr.getKey(k), and 'keyWritable' is directly assigned to k. There's no overlap in variables, so both lines can coexist without issues.

I should check if there's any reason these can't both be present. The code after the conflict is setting inputAttached to true, which is common to both. So merging both lines should resolve the conflict correctly. There's no ambiguity here because both changes are adding separate variables. So the resolved code should include both lines.</think>
```java
     */
    public void attachInput(PigNullableWritable k, Iterator<NullableTuple> inp) {
        try {
            tupIter = inp;
            key = pkgr.getKey(k);
            keyWritable = k;
            inputAttached = true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "Error attaching input for key " + k +
                    " in " + name() + " at location " + getOriginalLocations(), e);
```
