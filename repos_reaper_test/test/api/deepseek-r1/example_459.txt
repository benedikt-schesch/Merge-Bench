Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java imports. The HEAD version adds an import for DoNotUse from org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions, while the other side (7cf5285) removes that line. 

First, I need to understand why each change was made. Maybe in one branch, they started using the DoNotUse annotation and added the import, while in the other branch, perhaps that import was deemed unnecessary and removed.

But wait, since the conflict is about the presence or absence of that import line, I should check if the rest of the code uses that import. If there's no usage of DoNotUse in the surrounding code, then maybe the import was added by mistake in HEAD and the other branch correctly removes it. Alternatively, if the other branch's code does use DoNotUse, then we need to keep the import.

Looking at the provided code snippet, the only changes are in the imports. The rest of the imports are the same. The question is whether the DoNotUse import is needed. Since the user hasn't provided the entire file, I have to assume based on what's here.

If the HEAD branch added the import because they started using DoNotUse somewhere else in the file, and the other branch didn't have that change, then merging would require keeping the import. Conversely, if the other branch removed it because it's unused, but HEAD uses it, then we should keep it.

But without seeing the rest of the code, it's a bit ambiguous. The safest approach is to check if both imports are necessary. The Beta and DoNotUse are both under the same package, so if the code uses both annotations, both imports are needed. If not, the unused one should be removed.

However, since the user hasn't provided the actual usages, I can't be certain. Therefore, if there's ambiguity, the conflict should remain. But maybe the intended resolution is to keep both imports. Wait, looking at the conflict markers: the HEAD adds DoNotUse, and the other side removes it. If the two branches are conflicting on whether to include that import, and if the import is actually used in the code, then the correct resolution is to keep it. But if the import is not used, then it's safe to remove it.

But since I don't have the code context beyond the imports, I can't verify if DoNotUse is used. Therefore, the conflict might be unresolvable without more information. However, the user is asking to resolve based on intent and semantics. 

Assuming that both changes are valid, perhaps the HEAD added the import for a reason (maybe a new annotation is being used), and the other branch didn't touch that line. Wait, the other branch's change is to remove the import line. So maybe in one branch, the import was added, and in another, it was removed. If the import is needed, then keep it. If not, remove it.

But since the user hasn't provided the rest of the code, the conflict is ambiguous. Therefore, according to the instructions, if unsure, return the same snippet with the conflict. However, maybe the Beta import is present, and the DoNotUse is also needed. But in the HEAD version, both Beta and DoNotUse are imported, while in the other branch, only Beta is there. So the conflict is whether to include DoNotUse.

Alternatively, maybe the other branch's commit (7cf5285) is removing the DoNotUse import because it's no longer used, while HEAD is adding it. If the two branches are modifying the same line, then it's a conflict. But perhaps the correct resolution is to keep the DoNotUse import if it's needed.

But without knowing, I might have to leave the conflict as is. However, the user wants a resolution if possible. Let me think again. If the two branches are adding and removing the same import, and there's no other context, the correct approach is to check if the import is necessary. Since I can't check, maybe it's better to keep the import. Alternatively, if the other branch is removing it, maybe it's safe to remove.

Wait, in the code snippet, the HEAD adds DoNotUse, and the other side doesn't have it. So the conflict is between adding and not adding. If both are part of different features, maybe the import is needed in HEAD but not in the other branch. If the code in the current file uses DoNotUse, then the import should stay. Otherwise, it should be removed.

Since the user hasn't provided that information, I can't be certain. Therefore, according to the problem statement, if unsure, return the conflict. But maybe the import was added in HEAD for a reason and should be kept. So the resolved code would include the DoNotUse import.

Alternatively, perhaps the other branch's commit is deleting the DoNotUse import because it's not used, while the HEAD adds it. If the code in the file uses DoNotUse, then the correct resolution is to keep the import. Otherwise, remove it.

Since I can't verify usage, but as a merge expert, maybe the correct resolution is to keep both, but that's not possible here. Wait, the conflict is on that specific line. The HEAD version has the DoNotUse import, and the other branch doesn't. So the merge conflict is whether to include that line.

If the import is needed, keep it. If not, remove. Without knowing, but perhaps the user expects that the import is necessary, so resolve by keeping the DoNotUse import.

But according to the instructions, if unsure, return the conflict. However, if the intent is that both changes are trying to adjust the imports, and perhaps the DoNotUse is needed, then resolve by keeping it.

Therefore, the resolved code should include the DoNotUse import.</think>
