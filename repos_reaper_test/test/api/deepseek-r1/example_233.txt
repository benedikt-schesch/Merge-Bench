<think>
Okay, let me look at this merge conflict. The code is in Java, and the conflict is in the test assertions. The HEAD version uses getAtomField(0).longVal() and compares to the numbers 12 and 2. The other branch uses get(0) and compares to the strings "12" and "2". 

Hmm, the key here is understanding what each side is trying to test. The comment says that in lexicographic order, 12 comes before 2. That makes sense because as strings, "12" is less than "2" lexicographically. But if they were numbers, 12 would come after 2 numerically.

So the test is checking the ordering when the values are treated as strings. The HEAD version uses longVal(), which implies they're parsed as numbers. But the other branch uses get(0) which returns a string. The comment suggests the expected order is lexicographic, so the correct approach would be to compare strings, not numbers. Therefore, the branch that uses strings "12" and "2" is correct. The HEAD side might have a mistake here by using numeric comparison when the test is about lex order. 

Therefore, the conflict should be resolved by choosing the changes from the branch (the lower part), using the string comparisons. That way, the test correctly verifies the lexicographic order. Also, the spacing after the second iter.hasNext() in the HEAD version has an extra line before the assertEquals, but the other branch doesn't. I should preserve the spacing from the branch version to keep consistency.</think>
```java
        pigServer.registerQuery("c1 = order c by value;");

        // order in lexicographic, so 12 comes before 2
        Iterator<Tuple> iter = pigServer.openIterator("b1");
        assertTrue("b1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
        assertEquals("first item in b1", iter.next().get(0), "12");
        assertTrue("b1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
        assertEquals("second item in b1", iter.next().get(0), "2");
        assertFalse("b1 is over", iter.hasNext());

        iter = pigServer.openIterator("c1");
        assertTrue("c1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
