Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict between the HEAD and the other branch regarding the type of mOnScreenControlTexture. In HEAD, it's BitmapTexture, and in the other branch, it's BitmapTextureAtlas. 

First, I need to understand the context. Both branches are declaring a texture variable, but with different types. BitmapTexture and BitmapTextureAtlas might be related classes in the codebase. Maybe one branch updated the type to use a different class for better functionality or compatibility.

Looking at the surrounding code, there are TextureRegion variables, which are often used with texture atlases. If the other branch is changing to BitmapTextureAtlas, that could be part of a refactor to use texture atlases more efficiently. The variable name mOnScreenControlTexture suggests it's a texture resource for on-screen controls. 

Since the rest of the code uses TextureRegions (mOnScreenControlBaseTextureRegion and mOnScreenControlKnobTextureRegion), which are typically parts of a texture atlas, using BitmapTextureAtlas makes sense here. The HEAD version might be using an older or different approach. 

The conflict is straightforward: choosing between BitmapTexture and BitmapTextureAtlas. Since the other branch explicitly changes the type, and assuming that change is intentional (like adapting to a new API or optimization), the correct resolution is to take the BitmapTextureAtlas version from the conflicting branch. 

No other lines are conflicting, so the rest of the code remains as is. The boolean variable below doesn't conflict, so it stays. Therefore, the resolved code should use BitmapTextureAtlas for mOnScreenControlTexture.</think>
```java
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private Scene mScene;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mOnScreenControlTexture;
	private TextureRegion mOnScreenControlBaseTextureRegion;
	private TextureRegion mOnScreenControlKnobTextureRegion;

	private boolean mPlaceOnScreenControlsAtDifferentVerticalLocations = false;
```
