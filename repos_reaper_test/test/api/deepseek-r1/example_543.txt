Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. So, looking at the code snippet, the conflict is in the LOGGER line. The HEAD version has the log message as a single line, while the other branch splits the arguments into separate lines. The rest of the code seems the same.

Hmm, the main difference here is formatting. Both versions are logging the same message and exception, just with different line breaks. The intent is identical: log a severe error and exit. So the conflict is purely stylistic.

In Java, splitting method arguments across lines is common for readability, especially if they're long. The second version breaks the parameters into separate lines, which might be part of a code style preference. Since both achieve the same functionality, I should choose the version that's more consistent with the project's style. But since the user wants a semantic resolution, and both are semantically the same, either could work. However, the conflict markers need to be resolved.

Wait, the user said to preserve context and only resolve the conflict. Since the two changes don't affect functionality, maybe the correct approach is to pick one. But how? Maybe the second version (from the branch 1d97bfa) is better formatted because it aligns parameters vertically, which is a common practice. Alternatively, maybe the HEAD version is more concise.

But without more context on the project's coding standards, it's a bit ambiguous. However, as a merge resolver, I should reconcile the two. Since both are correct, perhaps take the multi-line version for readability. So replace the conflict with the second option, keeping the line breaks. That way, the log statement is formatted consistently if other parts of the code do that.

So the resolved code would have the LOGGER line split into multiple lines as in the branch version. The rest of the code remains the same. Let me check the surrounding context again. The lines after the conflict are the same, so no issues there. The conflict markers are removed, and the chosen code is inserted.</think>
