Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let's look at the two versions.

In the HEAD version, the method declaration is:
public List<InputSplit> getSplits(JobContext jobcontext) throws IOException, InterruptedException {

In the other branch (1cb2531), it's:
public List<InputSplit> getSplits(JobContext jobcontext) 
        throws IOException, InterruptedException {

The difference is the line break after the method parameters. The HEAD version has the throws clause on the same line, while the other branch wraps it to the next line with an indent. 

Semantically, both versions are the same. The only difference is formattingâ€”line wrapping. Since line breaks in method declarations don't affect functionality, this is a style conflict. The correct resolution would be to choose one format. 

Looking at the surrounding code, the rest of the method body starts with the configuration line. The original code's style might prefer either single-line or wrapped lines. However, since the conflict is purely about formatting, either version is acceptable. But maybe the second version (from 1cb2531) is more consistent with a style that breaks long lines for readability. Alternatively, the HEAD might be keeping it compact. 

But the user said to think about intent and semantics. Both changes intend to declare the method correctly. The conflict is stylistic. Since the throws clause is part of the method signature, but the line break doesn't change the meaning. 

To resolve, perhaps take one of the versions. Alternatively, check if there's any other difference. Looking at the code again, the only difference is the line break and the indentation of the throws clause. There's no code change, just formatting. 

In merge conflicts like this, it's safe to pick either version, but maybe the one that's more readable or follows project conventions. Since the user hasn't provided style guidelines, I can choose the version that has better formatting. The second version (from 1cb2531) breaks the line, which might be preferable if the line is long. But the original method name and parameters aren't that long. Let me check the line length. 

In HEAD, the line is:
public List<InputSplit> getSplits(JobContext jobcontext) throws IOException, InterruptedException {

That's a single line. The other version splits it into two lines. If the project's style guide enforces a maximum line length, the split might be necessary. However, without knowing that, the safest approach is to pick one. Since both are correct, perhaps the resolution is to keep the line as in the HEAD, or the split version. Alternatively, maybe the split version was a later change to adhere to line length limits. 

Since the user wants us to preserve intent and semantics, and since both versions are functionally identical, we can choose either. However, in merge conflicts, sometimes the order matters. But here, since it's a simple line break, maybe the correct approach is to accept both changes by adjusting the line break. Wait, but in a merge conflict, you can't have both. You have to pick one or the other, unless you can combine them in a way that satisfies both. 

Wait, no. The two versions are conflicting because they modified the same line in different ways. The conflict markers show that. So the resolution is to choose one of the two versions. But which one? 

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to take the HEAD version, assuming that it's the current branch's change, but that's not semantic. The user wants to resolve based on intent. 

Since there's no functional difference, and the conflict is purely formatting, the merge can take either. However, the user might expect us to prefer one based on conventions. For example, in Java, it's common to have the throws clause on the same line if it fits, or break it if it's too long. 

Looking at the line length: "public List<InputSplit> getSplits(JobContext jobcontext) throws IOException, InterruptedException {". Let's count the characters. Let's see:

"public List<InputSplit> getSplits(JobContext jobcontext) throws IOException, InterruptedException {" 

That's a long line. If the project's line length limit is, say, 80 or 100 characters, this might exceed it. Let's approximate:

The part before 'throws' is about 60 characters (assuming "public List<InputSplit> getSplits(JobContext jobcontext) " is around 60). Then adding "throws IOException, InterruptedException {" adds about 40 more, making the total around 100. If the project uses 100 characters, it's okay. Otherwise, splitting is better. 

But without knowing the project's style, it's hard to say. However, the second version splits the line, which is a common practice to keep lines shorter. So maybe the correct resolution is to take the split version from the other branch. 

Therefore, the resolved code would be the version from 1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81, keeping the line break and indentation. So the method declaration is split into two lines with the throws clause indented. 

Thus, the conflict is resolved by choosing the version from the other branch.</think>
