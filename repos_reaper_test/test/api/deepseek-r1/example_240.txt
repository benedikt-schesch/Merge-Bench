Okay, let's see. I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java imports. The HEAD side has an import for File, FileOutputStream, and IOException. Then there's the other side adding imports for OutputStream, Method, and maybe others. Wait, looking at the code:

The conflict is between the HEAD and the commit 1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81. The HEAD has imports up to IOException, and the other side adds imports for OutputStream, Method, along with the existing ones.

So the task is to merge these import statements correctly. In Java, imports are ordered, but sometimes when merging, you just combine the unique ones. Let me check which imports are unique to each side.

HEAD imports:
- java.io.File
- java.io.FileOutputStream
- java.io.IOException

The other side adds:
- java.io.OutputStream
- java.lang.reflect.Method

Wait, the other side's section shows they added OutputStream and Method. The existing imports from both sides include URI, URISyntaxException, URL, ArrayList, Collection. Those are common, so no conflict there.

So the conflict is in the import block. The correct resolution would be to include all the necessary imports from both branches. Since OutputStream and Method are not present in HEAD, they should be added. The other imports like File, FileOutputStream, IOException are already in HEAD, and the other side doesn't remove them. So combining both sets.

Therefore, the merged imports should include all the imports from both sides. Let's list them:

From HEAD:
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

From the other branch:
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

So combining these, the merged block would have all five imports in order. Java imports are typically ordered, but as long as they're all present, the order might not matter much here. Let's check the original order. The HEAD has File, FileOutputStream, IOException. The other branch adds OutputStream (which is another java.io) and Method from java.lang.reflect.

In Java conventions, java.lang imports come first, then other imports, but in the existing code, the other branch's Method is from java.lang.reflect, which is after the java.io imports. So maybe the correct order would be to group java.io together. Let's arrange them:

Original HEAD order:
File, FileOutputStream, IOException.

Other branch adds OutputStream (which is java.io) and Method (java.lang.reflect). So OutputStream should be grouped with the other java.io imports. So inserting OutputStream after FileOutputStream but before IOException? Or after? Wait, FileOutputStream is a subclass of OutputStream, but in terms of ordering, it's alphabetical. However, in practice, the order might not matter as long as they're all there.

But looking at the code as presented, the other branch's added imports are OutputStream and Method. So in the merged code, the imports would be:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collection;

Wait, but the original code in the conflict shows that after the conflict markers, the common imports are URI, URISyntaxException, URL, ArrayList, Collection. So the merged imports should include all the unique ones from both sides.

Wait, the conflict is only in the imports between the two branches. The code given is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
>>>>>>> 1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81

So the HEAD side has up to IOException, then the other side adds OutputStream and Method. So the correct merge is to include both the existing imports from HEAD and the new ones from the other branch. Therefore, the merged imports would have:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

Then the rest of the imports (URI, etc.) follow.

Therefore, the resolved code should combine all these imports, removing the conflict markers. Since there's no overlap (each side adds unique imports), there's no conflict except the order. But since the user says to preserve spacing as is, but the conflict is in the middle of the imports. Wait, looking at the original code:

The original code in the snippet is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
>>>>>>> 1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81

So the HEAD has:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

The other branch adds:

import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

So merging these would mean inserting the two new imports from the other branch into the HEAD's list. But where? Are they added after the existing ones or before? The other branch's code adds them between the existing imports and the rest. So in the merged code, the order would be:

File, FileOutputStream, IOException, OutputStream, Method, then URI, etc.

But since OutputStream is part of java.io, perhaps it's better to group them. But the user says to preserve the context as is. Wait, the user instruction is to return the entire snippet with the conflict resolved, preserving the spacing as is. So the original code's structure must be maintained. However, in the conflict, the two branches have different imports. The correct way is to take both sets of imports, combining them.

So the merged imports should include all imports from both sides, maintaining the order as per the original code. Let me check the order in the original code.

The original code in HEAD has:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

Then the other branch adds:

import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

So the merged imports would be:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import java.net.URI;
...

Thus, the two new imports are added after the existing ones in the HEAD. Therefore, the conflict is resolved by including all imports from both branches. Since there's no overlap (each side's imports are unique), there's no actual conflict except the merge markers. Therefore, the correct resolution is to combine both sets of imports.</think>
