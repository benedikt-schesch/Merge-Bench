Okay, let's see. There's a merge conflict in this Java code. The method channelConnected has two different conditions in the HEAD and the other branch.

In the HEAD version, the code checks if the system property "org.hbase.async.cdh3b3" is set. If so, it uses headerCDH3b3(), else header090(). Then calls helloRpc.

In the other branch (d543609...), there's an additional check first: if hbase_client.has_root is false, it uses header095(), writes it to the channel, becomes ready, and returns. Otherwise, it checks the system property like in HEAD but with an else if, then proceeds similarly.

So the conflict is between adding the new condition for has_root versus the existing system property check. The user wants to merge these changes without losing either functionality.

The correct resolution would be to include both conditions. The other branch's code adds the check for !hbase_client.has_root first. If that's true, it does some stuff and returns. Otherwise, it proceeds to check the system property. The HEAD version only has the system property check. So merging them would mean including the has_root check first, then the system property check as an else if, followed by the else case.

Looking at the code from both sides, the other branch's code includes the has_root condition, which seems like a necessary check before proceeding. The HEAD's code is part of the else block in the other branch. So combining them, the merged code should first check if has_root is false, handle that case, then check the system property, and else use header090.

So the resolved code would have the if (!hbase_client.has_root) block, then the else if (system property) and else. That way, both conditions are accounted for. The code from both branches is preserved, just structured correctly without conflict.

I need to make sure the syntax is correct, especially the placement of braces and the flow. The other branch's code adds the initial if block, then the else if from HEAD. So the merged code should look like:

if (!hbase_client.has_root) {
  ... header095 ...
} else if (System.getProperty(...)) {
  ... headerCDH3b3 ...
} else {
  ... header090 ...
}

Then call helloRpc. The Channels.write and becomeReady are part of the !has_root case, which returns early, so the helloRpc is only called in the other cases.

Yes, that makes sense. So the resolved code should integrate both changes, keeping the early return for the has_root case and then handling the system property as before.</think>
```java
  @Override
  public void channelConnected(final ChannelHandlerContext ctx,
                               final ChannelStateEvent e) {
    final Channel chan = e.getChannel();
    final ChannelBuffer header;
    if (!hbase_client.has_root) {
      header = header095();
      Channels.write(chan, header);
      becomeReady(chan, SERVER_VERSION_095_OR_ABOVE);
      return;
    } else if (System.getProperty("org.hbase.async.cdh3b3") != null) {
      header = headerCDH3b3();
    } else {
      header = header090();
    }
    helloRpc(chan, header);
