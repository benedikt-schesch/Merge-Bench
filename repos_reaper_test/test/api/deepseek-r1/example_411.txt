Okay, let's see. The user has a merge conflict in a Java import section. The HEAD version adds an import for TemplateModel from org.jbake.template.model, while the other side (d68ddea...) doesn't have that import. My task is to resolve this conflict by understanding the intent of both sides.

First, I need to check if both changes are compatible. The conflict is in the imports, so maybe one branch added a new import that the other didn't touch. Since the other branch just doesn't have that line, it's possible that the import is needed for some code added in HEAD. If the code in HEAD uses TemplateModel, then keeping the import is necessary. If the other branch removed it, but that's not the case hereâ€”it's just absent in one side.

Since merge conflicts in imports often can be resolved by including both changes, but in this case, it's a single line. The conflict is between adding an import (HEAD) and not having it (other branch). Unless the other branch explicitly removed it, which it doesn't seem like here, the correct resolution is to keep the import from HEAD. Because the other branch's version doesn't conflict except by not having that line. So the resolved code should include the TemplateModel import. Therefore, I'll remove the conflict markers and keep the import line.</think>
