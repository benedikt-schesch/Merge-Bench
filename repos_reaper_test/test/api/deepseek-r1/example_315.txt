Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let's look at what's happening here. Both branches are modifying the same part of the code where a ViewHolder is being set up. 

In the HEAD version, they're adding a followBtn by finding the view with R.id.follow_btn. The other branch, from commit 66827e9, is adding a testBtn using R.id.test_btn. 

The conflict is because both changes are in the same location. Now, I need to figure out the intent here. Are these two different buttons that both need to be included, or was one added as a replacement for the other? 

Looking at the variable names, followBtn and testBtn suggest different purposes. Maybe one branch added a follow button while another added a test button for debugging. If the application needs both, then both lines should be kept. But if they're conflicting changes (e.g., renaming or replacing), then one should be chosen over the other.

Since the surrounding code doesn't show any other references to these buttons, I can't be sure if both are needed. However, in merge conflicts, if both changes are additive and don't conflict semantically, including both might be the right approach. 

So the correct resolution would be to keep both lines, adding both holder.followBtn and holder.testBtn. That way, both views are initialized. The commented line for lastStatus is there, but that's commented out, so it's irrelevant. 

Therefore, the resolved code should include both findViewById calls for followBtn and testBtn, maintaining both changes from each branch.</think>
```java
			ViewHolder holder = new ViewHolder();
			holder.profileImage = (ImageView) view.findViewById(R.id.profile_image);
			holder.screenName = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.screen_name);
			holder.userId = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.user_id);
			//holder.lastStatus = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.last_status);
			holder.followBtn = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.follow_btn);
			holder.testBtn = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.test_btn);
		
			view.setTag(holder);
		} else {
			view = convertView;
		}
```

The resolution preserves both UI elements from conflicting branches since they appear to be separate view components (follow button and test button) that likely serve different purposes. Both findViewById calls are needed to properly initialize the ViewHolder with all required views from the layout. The order between them doesn't matter as they're independent assignments.
