Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the two versions. 

The conflict is in the line where `cardData` is initialized. The HEAD version uses `new ArrayList<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>>(playedCards.size())` with the full generic type specification. The other branch, from commit 5adedd2, uses the diamond operator `<>` to simplify it to `new ArrayList<>(playedCards.size())`.

The diamond operator was introduced in Java 7 to avoid redundant type arguments. Since the left side of the assignment already declares the generic type with `List<List<Map<...>>>`, using `<>` should be sufficient and is more concise. The two versions are semantically equivalent; the only difference is syntax. 

I should check if there's any reason the HEAD version might need the explicit type. Maybe if the code was written for an older Java version that doesn't support the diamond operator, but that's unlikely given the context. Since both initializations achieve the same result, using the shorter form from the commit 5adedd2 is better. 

Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the diamond operator from the incoming branch. There's no ambiguity here, so the conflict can be resolved by choosing the second option.</think>
```java
    } else {
      // getPlayerForUser synchronizes on players. This has caused a deadlock in the past.
      // Good idea to not nest synchronizes if possible anyway.
      final Player player = getPlayerForUser(user);
      synchronized (playedCards) {
        final List<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>> cardData = new ArrayList<>(playedCards.size());
        int faceDownCards = playedCards.size();
        if (playedCards.hasPlayer(player)) {
          cardData.add(getWhiteCardData(playedCards.getCards(player)));
          faceDownCards--;
        }
```
