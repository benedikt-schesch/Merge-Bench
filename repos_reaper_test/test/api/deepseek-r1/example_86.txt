Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The method signatures have a conflict between the HEAD and the other branch. Looking at the parameters:

HEAD version has:
final Set<CardSet> newCardSets, final int newMaxBlanks, final String newPassword, final boolean newUseTimer

The other branch has:
final int newMaxSpectators, final Set<CardSet> newCardSets, final String newPassword, final boolean newUseTimer

Wait, the parameters after newMaxPlayers differ. The HEAD includes newMaxBlanks, while the other branch adds newMaxSpectators. Also, the order is different. The code after the conflict sets this.maxSpectators = newMaxSpectators; which comes from the other branch's parameter. But in the HEAD version, there's no newMaxSpectators parameter, but there's newMaxBlanks. However, in the code below, maxSpectators is being assigned, which suggests that the other branch's parameter is needed. So maybe the correct parameters should include both newMaxSpectators and newMaxBlanks? Or perhaps one was added in one branch and the other in another. Wait, looking at the code after the conflict, it's setting maxSpectators, which is from the other branch's parameter. But in the HEAD version, there's newMaxBlanks, which isn't present in the other branch. So perhaps both parameters are needed. Wait, but the code in the method after the parameters is assigning maxSpectators. So the HEAD version's method doesn't have that parameter, but the other branch does. But in the code, the line this.maxSpectators = newMaxSpectators; is present. So if we take the HEAD version, which doesn't have newMaxSpectators as a parameter, that line would cause a compile error because newMaxSpectators isn't defined. Similarly, the other branch's version includes newMaxSpectators as a parameter, so that line would work. But then the HEAD has newMaxBlanks, which isn't present in the other branch. However, in the code after the parameters, there's no line that uses newMaxBlanks. Wait, looking at the code provided: after setting maxPlayers, there's this.maxSpectators = newMaxSpectators;. Then synchronized block. So if the HEAD version is missing the newMaxSpectators parameter, but the code is trying to assign it, that's a problem. Therefore, the correct parameters should include newMaxSpectators. But the HEAD version has newMaxBlanks. So maybe both parameters are needed. Let me check again. The HEAD version's parameters are: newScoreGoal, newMaxPlayers, newCardSets, newMaxBlanks, newPassword, newUseTimer. The other branch's parameters are: newScoreGoal, newMaxPlayers, newMaxSpectators, newCardSets, newPassword, newUseTimer. The code after the parameters sets this.maxSpectators = newMaxSpectators; which is present in the other branch's parameters. So the HEAD version's method doesn't have newMaxSpectators, leading to an error. Therefore, the correct resolution is to include newMaxSpectators. But the HEAD has newMaxBlanks, which isn't present in the other branch. However, in the code after the parameters, there's no line that uses newMaxBlanks. Wait, the code snippet provided ends with the synchronized block. Maybe the line that uses newMaxBlanks is further down, but it's not shown here. If the HEAD version added newMaxBlanks and uses it somewhere else, but the other branch added newMaxSpectators, then the parameters should include both. But the code here is setting maxSpectators, which is from the other branch. So to resolve the conflict, we need to merge both parameters. So the parameters should be in the order: newMaxPlayers, newMaxSpectators, newCardSets, newMaxBlanks, newPassword, newUseTimer. Wait, but how do the two versions differ? Let me list them again:

HEAD parameters after newMaxPlayers:
final Set<CardSet> newCardSets, final int newMaxBlanks, final String newPassword, final boolean newUseTimer

Other branch's parameters after newMaxPlayers:
final int newMaxSpectators, final Set<CardSet> newCardSets, final String newPassword, final boolean newUseTimer

So in the HEAD, after newMaxPlayers comes newCardSets, then newMaxBlanks. In the other branch, after newMaxPlayers comes newMaxSpectators, then newCardSets. So the conflict is that one branch added newMaxBlanks after newCardSets, and the other added newMaxSpectators before newCardSets. The code in the method uses newMaxSpectators, which is from the other branch, so that parameter must be present. But the HEAD's newMaxBlanks may be needed if it's used elsewhere in the method (though not visible here). If both parameters are needed, the correct resolution is to include both. So the parameters should include both newMaxSpectators and newMaxBlanks. The order would need to be determined. The other branch has newMaxSpectators before newCardSets, and the HEAD has newCardSets followed by newMaxBlanks. So perhaps the merged parameters would be: newMaxPlayers, newMaxSpectators, newCardSets, newMaxBlanks, newPassword, newUseTimer. That way, both new parameters are included. Therefore, the resolved method signature would have all the parameters from both branches. Let me check the code again: the line this.maxSpectators = newMaxSpectators; is present, so newMaxSpectators must be a parameter. Similarly, if the HEAD added newMaxBlanks, and it's used in the code (even if not visible here), then it must be included. So the correct merge is to include both parameters. Therefore, the method parameters should be:

final int newScoreGoal, final int newMaxPlayers,
final int newMaxSpectators,
final Set<CardSet> newCardSets, final int newMaxBlanks, final String newPassword,
final boolean newUseTimer

This combines both changes. So the conflict markers are removed, and both parameters are added in the correct order. The code then can assign both maxSpectators and maxBlanks (assuming that's present in the rest of the code). Since the user provided code snippet ends before seeing if newMaxBlanks is used, but the presence of the parameter in HEAD suggests it's needed. Therefore, the correct resolution is to merge both parameters, placing newMaxSpectators from the other branch before newCardSets, and newMaxBlanks from HEAD after newCardSets.</think>

    this.scoreGoal = newScoreGoal;
    this.maxPlayers = newMaxPlayers;

    synchronized (this.cardSets) {
      this.cardSets.clear();
