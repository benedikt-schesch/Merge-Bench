Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. So, looking at the code snippet, the conflict is in the import statements. The HEAD version has some imports, and the a17acec branch adds an import for ResponseErrorJsonParsingException.

First, I need to check if these imports are related or if they're separate. The existing imports are all exceptions from the com.restfb.exception package. The new import is also an exception from the same package. So, both sides are adding exception classes, but in different parts of the file.

In the HEAD version, the imports are:
- FacebookJsonMappingException
- FacebookOAuthException
- FacebookResponseContentException

Then, the a17acec branch adds ResponseErrorJsonParsingException below those. But in the conflict markers, the order might matter. Wait, looking at the code, the HEAD version has those three imports, and the a17acec adds the new one between the existing ones and the device token exceptions.

Wait, the conflict is between the HEAD and the a17acec branch. The HEAD has the three imports, and the a17acec adds the new import after those but before the device token exceptions. So, the correct resolution would be to include both sets of imports, combining them. Since the two changes are adding different imports, there's no actual conflict here. The user probably added a new import in one branch and another in the other, so merging them by including both.

So the resolved code should have all four imports: the three from HEAD and the new one from a17acec. The order might not matter, but it's best to keep them in the order they appear in both branches. Since the new import is added below the existing ones in the a17acec branch, we can place it after the three from HEAD. That way, we preserve both changes without any issues.

Therefore, the merged code should include all four imports in the order they appear, removing the conflict markers. There's no ambiguity here because both changes are adding different exceptions, so combining them makes sense.</think>
```java
import com.restfb.WebRequestor.Response;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookJsonMappingException;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookOAuthException;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookResponseContentException;
import com.restfb.exception.ResponseErrorJsonParsingException;
import com.restfb.exception.devicetoken.FacebookDeviceTokenCodeExpiredException;
import com.restfb.exception.devicetoken.FacebookDeviceTokenDeclinedException;
import com.restfb.exception.devicetoken.FacebookDeviceTokenPendingException;
import com.restfb.exception.devicetoken.FacebookDeviceTokenSlowdownException;
import com.restfb.scope.ScopeBuilder;
```

Rationale: Both branches are adding exception imports from the same package. The conflict can be resolved by simply including both imports while maintaining alphabetical order (though ordering isn't strictly required in Java imports). Since `ResponseErrorJsonParsingException` appears to be a legitimate additional exception type from the same package, and there's no overlap or contradiction between the changes, we safely combine both imports.
