Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java imports. Let me look at what's going on here. The HEAD version has two static imports from ResourceUtil: COLUMN_SELF_PCT and COLUMN_TOTAL_PCT. The other branch, ffd401c, has four different imports: GENERAL_DEPTH, GENERAL_SAMPLECOUNT, GENERAL_THREAD, and GENERAL_UNKNOWN. Both sides are adding different static imports from the same ResourceUtil class.

Since these are static imports of different constants, the correct resolution should be to include all of them. The conflict arises because both branches added different imports, and Git doesn't know which ones to keep. There's no overlap, so combining them makes sense. I should delete the conflict markers and keep both sets of imports. Let me check the order. The original order in the HEAD has the two COLUMN constants, and the other branch adds the GENERAL ones after TIME_SHARE but before the INFO constants. Wait, looking at the code, the HEAD's imports are after the FilterType imports, then the other branch's imports are also after the FilterType. So merging both sets would mean listing all the static imports from ResourceUtil together. However, in the code snippet, the HEAD's COLUMN imports are between the FilterType and the INFO constants, while the other branch's GENERAL imports are in the same place. So the correct way is to merge all the static imports from ResourceUtil, combining both sets.

So the resolved code should include all the imports from both branches. That means keeping COLUMN_SELF_PCT, COLUMN_TOTAL_PCT, GENERAL_DEPTH, GENERAL_SAMPLECOUNT, GENERAL_THREAD, GENERAL_UNKNOWN, and then the INFO constants. The order might matter if there's a specific convention, but since they're all static imports, it's safe to list them all. So I'll remove the conflict markers and include all the imports from both sides.</think>
