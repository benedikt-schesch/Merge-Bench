Okay, let me look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in a Java code snippet. The two versions are around a line that initializes a map called definedCommands. 

In the HEAD version, there's an extra line with just a space after the initialization of definedCommands. Then, the other version from commit 1488b22ce3... has a line with just a space but maybe without the trailing whitespace? Or maybe the difference is in the line endings or whitespace characters. 

Looking at the context, the conflict markers are around those lines. The code before the conflict is the initialization of definedCommands, and after the conflict is the declaration of packageImportList. The two versions seem to have a difference in whitespace or line breaks between the two variable declarations.

Since the user mentioned semantic merge conflicts, I need to determine if there's a semantic difference here. Both sides are probably just adding a line break or adjusting whitespace, which doesn't affect the code's functionality. The intent of both branches is likely the same: to have a line between the two variable declarations. 

So the correct resolution would be to take one of the versions, but since they might be identical except for whitespace, maybe just remove the conflict markers and keep one of the lines. However, looking at the exact code, the HEAD has a line with "    " (four spaces and a line break) and the other side has "    " (maybe four spaces and a line break as well). It's possible that the difference is trivial, like a trailing space or a line ending. 

In such cases, it's safe to resolve by keeping one of the versions, as there's no semantic conflict. Since both are adding a blank line or a line with just spaces, merging them by taking either side would work. The user wants the context preserved as much as possible, so perhaps the resolved code should have the line from HEAD or the other branch. But since the conflict is in the spacing between the two variables, maybe both sides are just adding a line, so the correct resolution is to have a single line there. 

Wait, looking again: the HEAD version has a line with "    " (four spaces) and a line break, and the other side has a line with "    " (same four spaces) but maybe without a trailing space? Or perhaps the conflict is due to a line break difference. In any case, since both are adding a blank line (or a line with just whitespace), the merge can be resolved by keeping one of them. But since the conflict is between the two variable declarations, maybe the intended code is to have a blank line between them. So removing the conflict markers and keeping the blank line from either side would resolve it. 

Therefore, the resolved code should have the line between definedCommands and packageImportList as a single blank line, which both sides probably intended. So the conflict is just a whitespace or line ending issue, so we can merge by taking either version. Since the user wants the context preserved and the spacing as is, perhaps the correct approach is to remove the conflict markers and keep the line from HEAD or the other branch. But in the given code, the HEAD has a line with "    " (four spaces) followed by a line break, and the other side has the same. Wait, looking at the code:

HEAD has:
    
=======
 
>>>>>>> ...

So maybe the difference is that HEAD has a line with four spaces and a line break, while the other side has a line with four spaces and a line break as well. Wait, no, maybe the line in HEAD is a line with four spaces (making it an empty line with indentation), while the other side has a line with just a line break (no spaces). Or maybe it's the other way around. 

In the code provided, the conflict is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    
=======

>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309

So the HEAD version has a line with "    " (four spaces) followed by a line break, and the other branch has a line with "    " (four spaces) but maybe followed by a different line ending, or perhaps the line is just empty. Wait, no: the code between the conflict markers is:

In HEAD:
    
 (which is four spaces, then a line break)

In the other branch:
 (empty line, but in the code shown as "=======" followed by a blank line? Or maybe the line is empty. Wait, the code after the ======= is:

    private static ArrayList<String> packageImportList = new ArrayList<String>();

Wait, no. Let me check again.

The code snippet as given is:

    /**
     * a table mapping names to streaming commands.
     */
    private Map<String, StreamingCommand> definedCommands = 
        new HashMap<String, StreamingCommand>();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    
=======

>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    private static ArrayList<String> packageImportList = new ArrayList<String>();

    public boolean debug = true;
    
    // List of paths skipped for automatic shipping

So between the conflict markers, the HEAD has a line with four spaces (indentation) and a line break, and the other branch has a line with nothing (maybe a blank line with no spaces). But looking at the code, the line after the HEAD marker is "    " (four spaces) and the line after ======= is nothing (maybe a blank line). So the conflict is about whether there's a line with four spaces or a completely blank line between the two variable declarations.

But in Java, the whitespace between variable declarations doesn't affect functionality. So semantically, both are the same. The intent is to have a blank line between them. However, in the code, one side added an indented line (four spaces) and the other added a blank line. But that might not be the case. Maybe in the HEAD, there's a line with four spaces (which would be a line containing four spaces, but in Java, that's allowed but not necessary), and the other branch just has a blank line.

Wait, but in Java, the code formatting is up to the developer. But in terms of merge conflict resolution, if both changes are trying to add a blank line, but one has trailing spaces, that's a whitespace difference. However, in Git, sometimes whitespace changes can cause conflicts. But since the user is asking for semantic resolution, the correct approach is to recognize that both sides intended to have a blank line there, so the conflict can be resolved by keeping either version, as the difference is purely stylistic.

But since the user wants the context preserved, maybe the correct approach is to take one of the versions. However, in the absence of any functional difference, the resolver can choose either. Alternatively, perhaps the correct resolution is to have a single blank line without any spaces, which would be the case in the other branch. But the HEAD has a line with four spaces. Maybe that's a mistake, but without more context, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the conflict is due to a line break difference. But in any case, the user wants the entire snippet with the conflict resolved, preserving context as is. So if the conflict is about whitespace, and the intent is the same (a blank line), then resolving by taking either side is acceptable. But since the user's instruction says to return the resolved code only if the intent is clear, otherwise leave the conflict.

In this case, the conflict is in the whitespace between the two variable declarations. Since both sides are adding a blank line (one with four spaces, one without), the intent is the same: to separate the variables with a blank line. The difference in whitespace is not semantic. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by choosing either version. However, in the original code, the line after the conflict in the HEAD is four spaces, which is probably a formatting error (an empty line with indentation), while the other branch has a normal blank line. So the correct resolution would be to take the version without the four spaces, i.e., the other branch's version, as having a blank line without unnecessary indentation is more standard.

Therefore, the resolved code would remove the conflict markers and keep the line from the other branch, which is a blank line. So the line between the two variable declarations would be a single blank line without any spaces. So the resolved code would look like:

    private Map<String, StreamingCommand> definedCommands = 
        new HashMap<String, StreamingCommand>();

    private static ArrayList<String> packageImportList = new ArrayList<String>();

But wait, looking at the original code, after resolving, the line from the other branch (======= side) is the line with nothing, so the resolved code would have the line from the other branch. So in the merged code, between the two variable declarations, there's a single blank line.

Thus, the answer should return the entire snippet without the conflict markers, choosing the version from the other branch (the ======= side), resulting in a blank line between the two variables.</think>
