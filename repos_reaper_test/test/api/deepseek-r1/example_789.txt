Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The HEAD side has the serializeInto method and the return statement, while the other branch (d543609) adds a deserialize method after the return. The conflict is because both branches are adding code in the same area.

The key is to see if the methods can coexist. The HEAD version ends the method with serializeInto and returns buf. The other branch adds a deserialize method. Since these are separate methods, they shouldn't interfere. The deserialize method is an override, so it's valid to have both methods in the class.

So the correct resolution is to keep both the serializeInto and the new deserialize method. The conflict markers should be removed, placing the deserialize method after the return statement but before the serializeInto method. Wait, looking at the code structure, the original code after the return would be the closing of the method. Then the deserialize method is a new method added. But in the conflict, the deserialize is added after the return, which is inside the same method? Wait, no. Let me check again.

Original code from HEAD: after serializeInto(buf); comes return buf; and then the method ends. Then the conflict shows the other branch adding the deserialize method after that. So in the code, the correct order would be the serializeInto method is part of one method, then the deserialize is a separate method. But the way the conflict is presented, the deserialize is added between the return and the serializeInto method. Wait, the code snippet shows:

  serializeInto(buf);

    return buf;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
  @Override
  Object deserialize(...) {
    ...
  }

>>>>>>> d543609...
  
  /** Serialize the raw ... */
  void serializeInto(...) {
    ...

So the HEAD side has nothing between the closing } of the method and the serializeInto method. The other branch adds the deserialize method there. Therefore, the correct resolution is to include the deserialize method between the two methods. Since the serializeInto method is a separate method, the deserialize should be placed after the previous method's closing brace. Therefore, merging both by keeping the deserialize method in that spot. There's no overlap in logic, so the conflict can be resolved by keeping both changes. The markers should be removed, and the deserialize method added where the other branch placed it. The HEAD doesn't have anything there, so accepting the incoming change. Thus, the resolved code will have the deserialize method after the return buf; method and before the serializeInto method's comment and definition.</think>
```java
    serializeInto(buf);

    return buf;
  }

  @Override
  Object deserialize(final ChannelBuffer buf, int cell_size) {
    HBaseRpc.ensureNoCell(cell_size);
    final MutateResponse resp = readProtobuf(buf, MutateResponse.PARSER);
    return null;
  }

  /** Serialize the raw underlying `Put' into the given buffer.  */
  void serializeInto(final ChannelBuffer buf) {
    buf.writeByte(CODE); // Code for a `Put' parameter.
    buf.writeByte(CODE); // Code again (see HBASE-2877).
    buf.writeByte(1);    // Put#PUT_VERSION.  Stick to v1 here for now.
