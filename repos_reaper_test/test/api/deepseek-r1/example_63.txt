Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The code in question is a Java method that creates a HashMap for events. The conflict is between the HEAD version, which uses the explicit type parameters in the constructor, and the other branch which uses the diamond operator.

First, I need to understand the intent of both changes. The HEAD version specifies the generic types when creating the HashMap, while the other branch uses the diamond operator (<>), which was introduced in Java 7 to simplify code by inferring the types from the left-hand side.

Since the method's return type and the declared type of 'data' is HashMap<ReturnableData, Object>, using the diamond operator here is safe and reduces redundancy. The diamond operator should work because the type parameters can be inferred correctly. Therefore, the change in the branch is a valid improvement that modernizes the code without altering functionality.

There's no semantic conflict here; both versions aim to create the same HashMap. The diamond operator is just a syntactic improvement. So the correct resolution is to keep the version with the diamond operator from the branch, as it's more concise and up-to-date.</think>
```java
  /**
   * @return A HashMap to use for events dispatched from this game, with the game id already set.
   */
  public HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> getEventMap() {
    final HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> data = new HashMap<>();
    data.put(LongPollResponse.GAME_ID, id);
    return data;
  }
