Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The HEAD version adds two menu items with specific icons and resource IDs. The other side, from commit ddf3e5f, seems to remove those menu items entirely. The conflict is because the two branches have different changes in the same part of the code.

I need to figure out the intent of both sides. The HEAD adds menu items for replies and direct messages. The other branch might be simplifying the menu by removing those items. But maybe the other branch didn't intend to remove them but had some other changes that caused this conflict.

Wait, the other side's code is just deleting those lines. So perhaps in one branch, the menu items were added, and in the other branch, they were removed. The correct resolution depends on which change should take precedence. If both changes are valid but conflicting, maybe the user wants to keep both. But in this case, they can't both be kept because one adds and the other removes.

If the user wants to preserve the menu items, they should keep the HEAD version. If they want to remove them, they should take the other side. Since the assistant isn't sure of the intent, but the problem says to resolve if possible. However, the user instructions say if unsure, leave the conflict. But the answer here needs to resolve it if possible.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "If you are not sure on how to resolve the conflict or if the intent is ambiguous, please return the same snippet with the conflict." So if the intent is ambiguous, leave it as is. In this case, since one side adds items and the other removes them, unless there's a way to merge, but they are conflicting changes. There's no way to merge them automatically because they are modifying the same lines. So unless there's a semantic way to combine, but in this code, it's either adding or not adding those items.

Therefore, the correct approach here is that if we can't determine which change is desired, we should leave the conflict. But maybe the user expects the expert to figure out the intent. However, without more context, it's ambiguous. So the answer should retain the conflict as is.</think>
