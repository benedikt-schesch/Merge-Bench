Okay, let me look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the constructor arguments for CSSURLEmbedder. The HEAD version has maxurilength and maximagesize, while the other branch has uriLength. I need to figure out the intent here.

First, I'll check if the parameters are related. The names maxurilength and uriLength seem similar, maybe they're the same parameter but renamed. The other branch doesn't have maximagesize. Maybe one side added a new parameter, or perhaps one removed it. 

Looking at the surrounding code, both branches are setting options based on skipMissingFiles. The parameters after verbose are different. If the other branch (790b69a) removed maximagesize and changed maxurilength to uriLength, then maybe the correct version is to use uriLength and drop maximagesize. Or perhaps the HEAD added maximagesize, and the other branch changed the name of another parameter.

Wait, maybe the parameters were refactored. If the other branch simplified the constructor by removing maximagesize and just using uriLength, then merging would require keeping the new parameter. Alternatively, maybe the HEAD version introduced both maxurilength and maximagesize, while the other branch introduced a single uriLength. 

Without more context, it's hard to tell. But semantically, if the intent was to rename maxurilength to uriLength and remove maximagesize, then the correct line would use uriLength. But if maximagesize is a necessary parameter added in HEAD, then we need to include both. However, since the other branch doesn't have it, maybe it's a conflict that can't be resolved automatically. 

Alternatively, maybe the parameters were consolidated. For example, uriLength in the other branch could be a combination of both maxurilength and maximagesize. But without knowing the class definition, it's risky to assume. 

Since the user said to resolve if intent is clear, otherwise leave the conflict. If I'm not sure, I should leave it as a conflict. But maybe the parameter was renamed, and maximagesize was removed. So the correct line would be using uriLength and dropping maximagesize. So the resolved line would be:

CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, uriLength);

But wait, the HEAD has two parameters, and the other branch has one. That's a problem. Unless maximagesize was a new addition in HEAD that's conflicting with a change in the other branch. In that case, it's a true conflict that needs manual resolution. So the correct approach is to present the conflict as is because the parameters differ in number and name, making the intent ambiguous.</think>

                options = options | CSSURLEmbedder.SKIP_MISSING_OPTION;
            }
