Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in a Java try block where they're processing a rawMessageTagsObject. The HEAD version uses rawMessageTagsObject.names() directly in the for loop, while the other branch (a17acec) uses getNames(rawMessageTagsObject). 

I need to figure out the intent behind both changes. The HEAD version is using the method names() from JsonObject, which probably returns the keys. The other side is calling a helper method getNames(). Maybe getNames() is a utility method that handles nulls or provides a different way to extract keys, perhaps for compatibility with different versions of the JSON library.

If the getNames() method is designed to replace direct calls to names(), maybe to handle cases where the object is null or to abstract the key retrieval, then using getNames() would be better. Alternatively, if the HEAD version's names() is correct for the current JSON library version, but the other branch is adapting to a different version, the resolution depends on which library version is correct now.

Assuming that the getNames() method was introduced to handle a scenario where rawMessageTagsObject might be null or to encapsulate the key retrieval logic (like handling a deprecated method), merging to use getNames() would incorporate that improvement. However, if the method names() is valid and getNames() is unnecessary, then HEAD is correct.

But without more context on what getNames() does, it's a bit ambiguous. However, since the branch changed it to use a method, perhaps that's a refactor to improve code maintainability or handle edge cases. So resolving the conflict by choosing the getNames() version would merge both intents, assuming that method is correctly implemented elsewhere.</think>
```java
      // message tags not in Graph API 2.5 format, ignore this exception and try another way
    }

    try {
      JsonObject rawMessageTagsObject = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(rawMessageTags, JsonObject.class);
      for (String key : getNames(rawMessageTagsObject)) {
        String tagArrayString = rawMessageTagsObject.get(key).toString();
        messageTags.addAll(jsonMapper.toJavaList(tagArrayString, MessageTag.class));
      }
      return;
    } catch (FacebookJsonMappingException je) {
