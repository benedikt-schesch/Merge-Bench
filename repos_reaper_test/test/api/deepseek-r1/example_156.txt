Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The code snippet is in Java, and the conflict is between the HEAD version and the commit 2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea. The conflicting lines are the instantiation of GruntParser.

In the HEAD version, the line is:
GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));

In the other branch, it's:
GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);

So the difference is the second argument 'myPig' in the constructor. I need to figure out which one is correct or if both changes can be incorporated. 

Looking at the surrounding context, after creating the parser, there's a line where myPig is used: myPig.getPigContext()... This suggests that 'myPig' is an existing variable in the scope, probably an instance of PigContext or similar. 

The GruntParser constructor might have been changed to require a Pig instance as a second parameter. The HEAD version might be using an older version of the constructor that only takes the StringReader, while the other branch is using a newer or updated constructor that includes the Pig instance. 

If the Pig instance is necessary for the parser to function correctly, especially if there are subsequent operations that rely on it (like parser.parseStopOnError()), then including 'myPig' would be the correct approach. The HEAD version might be outdated or missing a necessary parameter, leading to potential issues. 

Alternatively, maybe the constructor in HEAD is valid in some contexts, but the other branch's change is a necessary update. Since the code after the conflict uses 'myPig', it's likely that the constructor now requires that parameter to properly configure the parser with the Pig instance. 

Therefore, resolving the conflict by taking the version that includes 'myPig' as the second argument makes sense. This ensures that the parser is correctly initialized with the necessary Pig instance, which is used later in the code. 

So the resolved line should be:
GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);</think>
```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "illustrate b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            myPig.getPigContext().getProperties().setProperty("pig.usenewlogicalplan", "true");
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
