Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java code between two versions of the method `isNotEqualTo`. The HEAD version has the method declaration as `public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected){` while the other branch has `public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {`. The difference is the spacing before the opening curly brace.

In Java, the placement of curly braces is a style choice. Some people put the opening brace on the same line as the method declaration, others put it on the next line. Here, both versions have the brace on the same line, but HEAD doesn't have a space before it, while the other branch adds a space. 

The semantic intent of both versions is the same: to declare a method that asserts the byte is not equal to the expected value. The only difference is code formatting. Since the rest of the code is identical, this is a style conflict. 

The correct resolution would be to choose one style. Looking at the surrounding context, the method above `isEqualTo` is written as `public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected){` without a space. Wait, actually, looking at the code provided, the method before the conflict is `assertEqualTo`, which in the HEAD version is written with the brace on the same line without a space. The other branch's version of `isNotEqualTo` adds a space. But perhaps the project's coding style prefers one over the other.

However, in the conflict, the HEAD version has no space, and the other branch adds a space. Since the code around it (like the `assertEqualTo` method) in the HEAD might follow the same style, maybe without the space. But the user hasn't provided the full context of other methods. However, in the given snippet, the method before the conflict in the HEAD is written as:

  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected){

And the other branch's version is:

  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {

So, the conflict is purely about the space before the curly brace. Since both versions are functionally the same, the resolution is to pick one. If the project's existing code uses one style consistently, we should follow that. If not sure, maybe go with the more common style, which often includes a space before the opening brace in Java. Alternatively, check the surrounding code in the snippet. 

Looking at the code above the conflict, the method `assertEqualTo` is written as:

    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected){

So, in HEAD, the `isNotEqualTo` method has the opening brace without a space. The other branch's version adds a space. However, in the code after resolving the conflict, if the project uses the style without space, then keep HEAD's version. But if the other branch is correcting the style to add a space, then adopt that. 

But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, since the user said to resolve the conflict by considering the intent and semantics, and since the only difference is formatting, the correct approach is to pick one style. If both branches are making style changes, but in this case, it's a single method. Since the conflict is between two styles, perhaps the correct resolution is to include the space, as it's a common Java convention to have a space before the opening brace for method definitions. 

Wait, but in the code above, the method before the conflict (from HEAD) is written without the space. So maybe the existing code in HEAD uses the style without the space. If that's the case, then to maintain consistency, we should keep the HEAD version. However, the other branch's change is adding a space, perhaps as part of a code style cleanup. 

But since the user's instruction is to resolve the conflict based on intent and semantics, and the actual code inside the method is the same, the correct resolution is to accept one of the versions. Since the conflict is about formatting, the merge should choose whichever is the project's standard. If we can't determine that, maybe follow the HEAD version if that's the existing style. But the user hasn't provided more context. 

Alternatively, since the other branch's change adds a space, which is a minor style improvement, perhaps that's acceptable. However, without knowing the project's guidelines, it's risky. 

But the user says if unsure, leave the conflict. But in this case, the intent is the same, so the correct resolution is to pick either version. Since the conflict is trivial, perhaps the best way is to take the version with the space, as it's more common in Java to have a space there. 

Wait, Java's standard convention is to have the opening brace on the same line as the method signature, with a space before it. For example:

public void method() {
    // code
}

So the other branch's version with the space is correct according to standard Java style. Therefore, resolving the conflict by taking the version with the space would be appropriate. 

Thus, the resolved code should be:

  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

So, the merge conflict markers are removed, and the method is written with the space before the curly brace.</think>
```java
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```
