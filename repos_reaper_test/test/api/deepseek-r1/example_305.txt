Okay, let's see. The user provided a Java code snippet with a merge conflict. The task is to resolve the conflict by understanding the intent of both changes without modifying the surrounding context.

The conflict is in the onResume() method. The HEAD version calls qrCodeReaderView.startCamera(); while the other branch checks if myDecoderView is not null before calling myDecoderView.startCamera();.

Hmm, the key here is that both changes are about starting the camera, but they're using different variables. Maybe the variables were renamed or represent different components. The HEAD uses qrCodeReaderView directly, assuming it's non-null. The other branch uses myDecoderView with a null check, which is safer.

Wait, but are qrCodeReaderView and myDecoderView the same thing? Maybe they were refactored or renamed. If they're supposed to be the same, perhaps one branch updated the variable name. But if they're different components, then both might need to be called. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe one branch replaced the use of qrCodeReaderView with myDecoderView. For example, if the code was refactored to rename the variable, then the correct resolution would be to use myDecoderView with the null check. But if both variables are separate and both need their cameras started, then we should call both, but that might not be intended.

But looking at the surrounding code, the onPause() method is there but empty. Maybe in other parts of the code, these variables are initialized. If the HEAD version removed the null check, while the other branch added it for safety, the correct approach would be to keep the null check but with the correct variable.

Wait, but the HEAD uses qrCodeReaderView, and the other branch uses myDecoderView. That suggests that the two changes are conflicting in terms of which component is being used. This might be a case where the variable was renamed. For example, maybe in one branch, qrCodeReaderView was renamed to myDecoderView. So if the correct variable is myDecoderView now, then the resolved code should use that with the null check. But if qrCodeReaderView is still the correct variable, then maybe the null check should be added to it.

But without knowing which variable is correct, it's ambiguous. The user says if unsure, leave the conflict. But maybe the intent is that the variable was renamed, so the correct code is using myDecoderView with the null check. Alternatively, maybe both variables exist and both need their cameras started. But that's less likely.

Alternatively, maybe the two changes are from different features: one starts the QR code reader, the other starts a decoder view. But that would be a semantic conflict. In that case, both lines should be kept. But the code would call both methods. However, in the given code, only one of the lines is present in each branch.

Wait, but the code is in the same method. So maybe the correct approach is to check if both variables need to have their cameras started. But if that's the case, then the resolved code would have both calls. But the user didn't provide the full context. Alternatively, maybe the two variables are the same, just renamed. For example, in one branch, the variable was renamed from qrCodeReaderView to myDecoderView. So the correct code is to use the new name with the null check.

But how can I be sure? The user says to think in terms of intent. Both sides want to start the camera, but one adds a null check. The HEAD doesn't have a null check, which could lead to a crash if qrCodeReaderView is null. The other branch adds a null check for myDecoderView. So perhaps the intended code is to start the camera for myDecoderView with a null check, assuming that's the correct variable now. But if the variable name in HEAD is correct, then maybe the null check should be added to qrCodeReaderView.

But without knowing which variable is the right one, it's ambiguous. The user says if unsure, return the conflict. But maybe the variables are supposed to be the same, and the correct resolution is to use myDecoderView with the null check, assuming that the variable was renamed in one branch. Or maybe the correct code is to have both checks. But that would require more context.

Alternatively, perhaps the two changes are from different features that both modify the same line. For example, one branch renames the variable and adds a null check, while the other branch doesn't. In that case, the correct resolution is to take the renamed variable with the null check.

But I'm not sure. The user's instruction is to resolve if possible, otherwise leave the conflict. Since the variable names differ, and it's unclear if they refer to the same component, it's ambiguous. Therefore, the conflict remains.</think>
```java
  }

  @Override protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();

<<<<<<< HEAD
    qrCodeReaderView.startCamera();
=======
    if (myDecoderView != null) {
      myDecoderView.startCamera();
    }
>>>>>>> cb961dc3d5c704340d8ab747637d1c475bedc03d
  }

  @Override protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();


``` 

The conflict remains unresolved due to ambiguity between `qrCodeReaderView` and `myDecoderView` references. Without additional context to determine if these represent the same component with a rename, or distinct components requiring separate handling, we preserve both intents (direct camera start vs null-checked start) for human judgment.
