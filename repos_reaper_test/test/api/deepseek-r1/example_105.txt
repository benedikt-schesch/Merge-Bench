Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code snippet. Let me look at the changes from both branches.

In the HEAD version, the static imports are using wildcards: junit.framework.Assert.* and org.fest.test.ExpectedException.none. Then there's the import for ErrorMessages.descriptionIsNull.

In the other branch (06e8633), they're importing specific methods from Assert: assertEquals and assertSame. They also include the same static imports for TestData.someDescription, ErrorMessages.descriptionIsNull, and ExpectedException.none.

Wait, the conflict is in the static imports. The HEAD uses wildcards, while the other branch lists specific methods. But when merging, using wildcards can cause issues if there are overlapping method names. However, in this case, the other branch is adding explicit imports for assertEquals and assertSame, which might be because they want to avoid wildcard imports for clarity or to prevent conflicts.

But in Java, static imports are resolved based on specificity. If both branches are modifying the same area, I need to combine them. However, wildcard imports and specific imports can coexist, but it's redundant. The specific imports would take precedence, but including both might not be necessary.

Wait, looking at the code, the HEAD version has:

import static junit.framework.Assert.*;
import static org.fest.test.ErrorMessages.descriptionIsNull;
import static org.fest.test.ExpectedException.none;

The other branch has:

import static junit.framework.Assert.assertEquals;
import static junit.framework.Assert.assertSame;
import static org.fest.assertions.test.TestData.someDescription;
import static org.fest.test.ErrorMessages.descriptionIsNull;
import static org.fest.test.ExpectedException.none;

So the conflict is between the wildcard import of Assert.* and the specific imports of assertEquals and assertSame. Also, the other branch adds TestData.someDescription, which is present in both versions after the conflict markers.

The goal is to merge these without conflicts. The best approach here is to replace the wildcard import with the specific imports from both branches. Because using wildcard imports can lead to including unnecessary classes, while specific imports are clearer.

So, the merged imports should include both assertEquals and assertSame from junit.framework.Assert, as well as any other necessary static imports. Wait, but the HEAD's wildcard includes all static methods from Assert, while the other branch only imports two. However, if the code in both branches uses only those two methods, then replacing the wildcard with the specific imports would be correct. But if there are other methods from Assert used elsewhere that aren't shown here, that could be a problem. But given the context provided, we have to assume that the specific imports are the correct ones.

Additionally, the other branch adds the import for TestData.someDescription, which is present in both versions after the conflict, but in the HEAD version, it's after the conflict. Wait, looking at the code:

In the HEAD, after the conflict markers, there's:

import static org.fest.assertions.test.TestData.someDescription;
import static org.fest.test.ErrorMessages.descriptionIsNull;
import static org.fest.test.ExpectedException.none;

In the other branch, the same line is present. So that line is common to both. Therefore, the conflict is only in the junit imports and the order of the static imports.

So the correct resolution would be to take the specific imports from the other branch (assertEquals and assertSame) and remove the wildcard import from HEAD. Then include all other static imports as they appear.

Therefore, the merged code should have:

import static junit.framework.Assert.assertEquals;
import static junit.framework.Assert.assertSame;
import static org.fest.assertions.test.TestData.someDescription;
import static org.fest.test.ErrorMessages.descriptionIsNull;
import static org.fest.test.ExpectedException.none;

That way, both the specific methods are imported, and the other static imports are preserved. Also, the order in the merged code should maintain the static imports from junit first, followed by the others. Since in the other branch, the TestData import comes after the junit ones, and in the HEAD, it's after the conflict. So combining them, the order should be junit imports, then TestData, then ErrorMessages, then ExpectedException.

Therefore, the resolved code would merge both changes by replacing the wildcard with the specific imports and keeping the TestData import line as is.</think>
