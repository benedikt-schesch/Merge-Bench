Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java code where two different changes were made to how the spectatorsCopy array and spectatorNames list are initialized.

In the HEAD version, they're using spectators.toArray(new User[spectators.size()]) to convert the spectators collection to an array. Then initializing the ArrayList with spectatorsCopy.length. The other branch (from commit 5abbe...) is using new User[0] in the toArray call and using the diamond operator <> in the ArrayList initialization.

I need to figure out which of these changes are compatible or if there's a semantic reason to choose one over the other. Let's recall that in Java, using toArray(new User[0]) is actually considered a good practice because it's type-safe and can be more efficient in some cases, as the runtime can optimize the array size. The other approach, using spectators.size(), might be slightly less efficient because it creates an array of the exact size, but that's not a big issue here.

As for the ArrayList initialization, the HEAD version explicitly specifies the initial capacity as spectatorsCopy.length, which is correct because the array's length is known. The other branch uses the diamond operator, which is a Java 7+ feature that allows omitting the type arguments if they can be inferred. Since both sides are initializing the list with the same capacity, the diamond operator is just a syntax improvement and doesn't change functionality.

So the changes from both branches can be merged without conflict. The toArray can take the User[0] approach, which is better practice, and the ArrayList can use the diamond operator. Therefore, the resolved code should use both changes. Let me combine those: spectators.toArray(new User[0]) and new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length). That way, we incorporate both improvements.</think>
```java
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      playerNames.add(player.getUser().getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.PLAYERS, playerNames);

    final User[] spectatorsCopy = spectators.toArray(new User[0]);
    final List<String> spectatorNames = new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length);
    for (final User spectator : spectatorsCopy) {
      spectatorNames.add(spectator.getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.SPECTATORS, spectatorNames);
