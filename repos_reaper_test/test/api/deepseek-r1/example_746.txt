Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the notifySidebarSlideClose method. Both sides are setting the translationX with an animate, and the duration is using SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS. The difference is in how the setDuration is formatted.

In HEAD, the line is all on one line: .setDuration(SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();

In the other branch, it's split into two lines with a line break after setDuration(. So the code is the same semantically, just formatted differently. 

Since the only difference is formatting, the intent is the same. The correct resolution would be to pick either formatting style. But since the surrounding code might have a style preference, I should check the context. Looking at the surrounding lines, in the HEAD version, the method notifySidebarSlideOpen has the code starting without a line break. The other method here in the conflict has the animate call. If the project uses a style where method chaining is on the same line, then HEAD's version is better. Alternatively, if they prefer breaking lines for readability, the other branch's version is better.

But since the conflict is purely about formatting and both achieve the same thing, we can choose either. However, in merge conflicts, if both changes are equivalent, it's safe to pick one. Alternatively, maybe the second branch's line break is to adhere to a line length limit. Without more context, but since the user said to resolve based on intent and semantics, and both are the same, we can merge by choosing one. But the user might want to keep the line break for readability. Wait, but the original code in the HEAD has it on one line, and the other branch splits it. However, maybe the correct resolution is to keep the line break as it's just formatting. But since the user says to preserve spacing unless sure, but the task is to resolve the conflict.

Alternatively, perhaps the line was split to make it more readable. Since both are valid, but the conflict is about formatting, the correct resolution is to accept one of them. Since the line is not too long, maybe keeping it on one line is fine. Alternatively, the other branch's split might be preferred. But without project-specific style guidelines, it's hard to say. However, the semantic meaning is identical. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by taking either version. Since the user instructed to resolve the conflict by considering intent and semantics, and both are the same, the correct approach is to remove the conflict markers and choose either version. But the answer needs to return the resolved code. Since the user's example shows that the assistant should resolve it if possible, here the conflict is purely formatting, so it's safe to pick one. Let's go with the version that splits the line for better readability, as it might adhere to line length conventions. So the resolved code would have the setDuration on the next line, as in the second branch. Therefore, the merged code would be:

animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(
        SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();

But wait, in the original conflict, the HEAD version is on one line, and the other branch splits it. So the resolution is to take the split line version. However, looking at the surrounding code, in the notifySidebarSlideOpen method, the code after the conflict is:

public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {
    FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
<<<<<<< HEAD

There's no code after that in the provided snippet. But in the existing code, maybe other methods have similar formatting. Since the user hasn't provided more context, but the conflict is about line breaks, the resolution should be to accept both changes by combining them? Wait, no. The conflict is between two versions of the same line. The correct way is to choose one. Since both are semantically the same, perhaps the resolved code should take the version with the line break, as it's more readable. Therefore, the merged code would have the line split as in the second branch. So the final code after resolving would be:

        animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(
                SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();

Thus, the conflict markers are removed, and the code from the second branch is kept. The other parts of the context remain unchanged.</think>
```java
        setTranslationX(finalX);
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideClose() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
        animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(
                SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
