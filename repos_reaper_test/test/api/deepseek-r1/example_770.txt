Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The conflict is in the JavaDoc comment for the DeleteRequest class. The HEAD version says that the DeleteRequest will delete values with timestamps less than or equal to the specified one. The other branch adds an exception when setDeleteAtTimestampOnly is called, which makes it delete only the exact timestamp.

Hmm, so the intention here seems to be that by default, the delete affects all entries up to and including the given timestamp. But if you call setDeleteAtTimestampOnly, it changes the behavior to only delete that exact timestamp. The conflict is in the documentation comment, so both sides are trying to describe the behavior accurately.

The correct resolution would be to combine both pieces of information. The HEAD version is missing the part about the method, and the other branch adds that detail. So the merged comment should include the default behavior and the exception when the method is called. That way, the documentation is complete.

Looking at the structure, the original text from HEAD ends with "less than or equal to that of the DeleteRequest." The conflicting part adds "unless..." followed by the method explanation. So merging them would involve adding the "unless" clause from the other branch into the HEAD's text, making sure the sentence flows correctly.

So the resolved line should read: "or equal to that of the {@code DeleteRequest} unless {@link #setDeleteAtTimestampOnly} is also called, in which case only the value at the specified timestamp is deleted."

This way, both intents are captured: the default behavior and the exception when the method is used. I don't see any ambiguity here because the two changes are complementary. The method modifies the behavior, so the documentation needs to mention both cases. Therefore, combining both parts makes the documentation accurate and complete.</think>
