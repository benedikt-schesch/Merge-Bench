Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java import statements. Let me look at the two versions.

In the HEAD version, the imports are:
- org.apache.commons.configuration.ConfigurationException
- org.jbake.app.FileUtil
- org.jbake.app.JBakeException
- org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfiguration
- org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfigurationFactory

Then the conflicting part from the other branch adds:
- org.jbake.util.ConfigurationPrinter
- org.kohsuke.args4j.CmdLineException
- org.kohsuke.args4j.CmdLineParser

The rest of the imports after the conflict are the same in both branches: org.slf4j and picocli stuff.

So the conflict is about adding these three new imports from the other branch. The HEAD doesn't have them, and the other branch does. Since these are separate imports, there's no overlap in the lines except where they were added. Merge conflicts in imports usually just require combining both sets, as long as there's no duplication.

Let me check if any of the imports are duplicates. The HEAD has JBakeConfiguration and JBakeConfigurationFactory. The other branch adds ConfigurationPrinter, CmdLineException, and CmdLineParser. These are all distinct packages, so no duplicates. Therefore, the correct resolution is to include all the imports from both branches.

Now, I should order them properly. Typically, Java imports are ordered with standard libraries first, then third-party, then project-specific. But looking at the existing order, they might be grouped by package. Let's see:

The existing imports after the conflict are org.slf4j and picocli. The added ones from the other branch are org.jbake.util and org.kohsuke.args4j. So, perhaps group the org.jbake imports together. The HEAD already has org.jbake.app and org.jbake.app.configuration. The other branch adds org.jbake.util.ConfigurationPrinter, which is a different subpackage. So inserting that after the existing org.jbake imports would make sense.

Similarly, the org.kohsuke.args4j imports are new. Those are third-party libraries, so they should be grouped with similar ones. The existing imports have picocli.CommandLine, which is another command-line parsing library. However, the other branch is adding args4j, which is a different library. Maybe they're transitioning from args4j to picocli? But the user might have both for some reason. However, since the conflict is in the imports, and the code might be using both, we should include all.

But wait, the HEAD version has picocli imports, while the other branch has args4j. That might indicate a conflict in dependencies. But from the user's code snippet, both sets of imports are present. The merge should include all necessary imports. Since the conflict is just about adding those three imports, and the rest are the same, the resolution is to include all imports from both sides, ordered appropriately.

So the merged imports should be:

import org.apache.commons.configuration.ConfigurationException;
import org.jbake.app.FileUtil;
import org.jbake.app.JBakeException;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfigurationFactory;
import org.jbake.util.ConfigurationPrinter;
import org.kohsuke.args4j.CmdLineException;
import org.kohsuke.args4j.CmdLineParser;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.slf4j.bridge.SLF4JBridgeHandler;
import picocli.CommandLine;
import picocli.CommandLine.MissingParameterException;

This way, all the necessary imports from both branches are included. There's no duplication, so this should resolve the conflict without issues.</think>
