Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code is in Java. The conflict is between the HEAD version and the branch version. Both sides are trying to create a query for PyxCardSet where the ID is in a list of IDs from options.

In the HEAD version, the code is formatted with the session.createQuery call split into multiple lines. The query is "from PyxCardSet where id in (:ids)", then setting the parameter list. The branch version has the same code but written in a single line, without the line break after createQuery.

The semantic difference here is just formatting. Both versions are doing the same thing: creating a query, setting the parameter list with the same IDs. The intent is identical; only the code style differs. 

So, the conflict arises from a formatting change. To resolve this, we can choose either version, but since the HEAD version has more readable formatting with the method calls on separate lines, maybe that's preferred. Alternatively, maybe the branch version is a refactor to make it concise. But since the user hasn't specified a style guide, we need to pick one.

Wait, but the user said to think about the intent and semantics. Since both are semantically the same, the resolution is to pick one. Since the conflict is just about code formatting, merging them by choosing either would work. However, perhaps the branch version is a simplification. Alternatively, maybe the HEAD version was a formatting improvement. 

But looking at the code, the HEAD version has the session.createQuery on a new line, which might be part of a code style that breaks lines for readability. The branch version puts it all in one line. Since the actual code functionality is the same, the merge conflict can be resolved by choosing one of the two. 

In such cases, it's safe to pick either, but perhaps the more readable one. Alternatively, maybe the branch version is from a commit that optimized code formatting. Without more context, it's hard to say. However, since the user asked to resolve based on intent and semantics, and since both versions do the same thing, the correct resolution is to take either version. 

But wait, maybe there's a different approach. Perhaps the line breaks were added for readability, so keeping the HEAD version's formatting is better. Alternatively, the branch might have a reason to put it in one line, but that's unlikely. Since there's no functional difference, the merge can be resolved by keeping one of the versions. 

The user's instruction says to preserve spacing as is if unsure. Wait, no: the user says if not sure or intent is ambiguous, return the same snippet with conflict. But in this case, the intent is clear: both versions are doing the same thing, just formatting differs. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by choosing either version. However, the assistant should make a decision here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to combine both? No, because they are the same line, just formatted differently. So the resolution is to pick one. Since the assistant is supposed to resolve the conflict, it should choose the version that best maintains code style consistency. If the surrounding code uses multi-line method chaining, then HEAD is better. If it's more concise, then the branch version. 

Looking at the surrounding code: in the original context, the code after the conflict has cardSets.addAll(pyxCardSets); and comments. The line before the conflict is session.createQuery(...) in HEAD split into two lines, and in the branch it's one line. 

In Java, it's common to break lines for readability when method chaining. So the HEAD version might be preferred. Therefore, the resolved code would take the HEAD version. Alternatively, perhaps the branch version is a later change that reformats the code. But since we don't have the commit messages, it's hard to tell. 

But according to the problem statement, the user wants the conflict resolved based on intent and semantics. Since both versions are semantically the same, the correct resolution is to accept either. However, since the assistant needs to make a decision, perhaps choosing the HEAD version is better as it's more readable. 

So, the resolved code would be the HEAD version. The branch version's code is the same but in a single line. So, the conflict markers are removed, and the HEAD code is kept. Alternatively, maybe the branch version is correct. But without more context, the assistant has to make a choice. 

Wait, the user said to return the same snippet with conflict if unsure. But in this case, the intent is clear, so the assistant should resolve it. Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the HEAD version's formatting.</think>
