Okay, let's see. The user provided a Java code snippet with a merge conflict. My task is to resolve this conflict by understanding the intent of both changes while preserving the context.

Looking at the conflict, the HEAD version has both ScanCallback and AdvertiseCallback declarations with a comment mentioning API 21+. The other side, from commit e9e8024, only keeps the ScanCallback with a comment "Scan Callback".

I need to figure out why these changes were made. The HEAD side probably added support for advertising, which is an API 21+ feature, hence the comment. The other side might have simplified or removed the advertising part, maybe considering it's not needed or moving it elsewhere.

Wait, the surrounding code has a TODO about preventing something from running on KitKat (API 19). The pluginInitialize method checks for SDK < LOLLIPOP (API 21), so it returns on lower versions. That suggests that the code in HEAD is correct because AdvertiseCallback is indeed for API 21+, which aligns with the SDK check. The other branch might have removed AdvertiseCallback by mistake or as part of a refactor, but since the pluginInitialize is guarding against lower APIs, keeping both callbacks makes sense if they're used elsewhere in the code.

But why would the other side remove AdvertiseCallback? Maybe it's not used, or perhaps there was a merge error. Without more context, it's safer to assume that both callbacks are necessary for the functionality related to API 21+. The comment in HEAD is more specific, which is better. Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep both ScanCallback and AdvertiseCallback from HEAD and discard the conflicting change from the other branch.</think>
```java
        scanCallbackContext.sendPluginResult(pluginResult);
      }
    }
  };

  //API 21+ Scan and Advertise Callbacks
  private ScanCallback scanCallback = null;
  private AdvertiseCallback advertiseCallback = null;

  //TODO Is there a cleaner way to prevent this from running on KitKat
  protected void pluginInitialize() {
    if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
      return;
``` 

Reasoning: The conflict resolution preserves both callback declarations while maintaining the API level documentation. The HEAD version's comment about API 21+ directly aligns with the version guard in pluginInitialize() that references LOLLIPOP (API 21). The advertising callback is relevant for API 21+ functionality and should be retained since the version check prevents it from running on lower APIs.
