Okay, let me look at this merge conflict. The code has two versions between HEAD and the other branch. The conflict is about the position of the 'roundPermalinkFormatProvider' field and a comment.

In the HEAD version, the field is declared right after the comment about moving delays to pyx.properties. The other branch has the comment first, then the field. Both versions include the same line, just in a different order.

Wait, the comment is the same in both. The HEAD has the field before the comment, and the other branch has the comment before the field. But looking closer, actually, in HEAD, the field is before the comment, and in the other branch, the comment is above the field. But the comment line is identical in both. So the conflict is about where the field is placed relative to the comment.

The intent here seems to be that both branches added the 'roundPermalinkFormatProvider' field, but one placed it before the comment and the other after. But actually, maybe one branch added the comment and the other added the field. Wait, looking at the context:

In HEAD:
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private final Provider<String> roundPermalinkFormatProvider;

  // All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.
=======

  // All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.
  private final Provider<String> roundPermalinkFormatProvider;
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a

So the conflict is between the two versions. In HEAD, the field is declared first, then the comment. In the other branch, the comment is first, then the field. Both are adding the same line but in different order. Since the comment is the same, it's likely that one branch added the comment and the field in one order, and the other branch maybe moved the comment or added it. But since both have the comment and the field, the correct resolution is to have the comment once and the field once. But since the order is conflicting, we need to decide which order makes sense.

Looking at the surrounding code, before the conflict, there are several Provider fields declared. Then in the conflict area, both versions have the comment and the field. The order in HEAD is field then comment, and the other branch is comment then field. But the comment says "All of these delays could be moved...", which probably refers to the configuration options. The fields are likely configuration parameters, so having the comment above the fields makes more sense, as comments usually precede the code they describe. So the other branch's version (comment above the field) is more appropriate.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the comment first, then the field. So we should take the version from the other branch, which places the comment before the field declaration. That way, the comment explains the fields that follow. So we remove the conflict markers, keep the comment once, followed by the field, and ensure no duplication.

So the resolved code would have:

  private final Provider<String> roundPermalinkFormatProvider;
  // All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.

Wait, no. Wait, looking at the two sides:

HEAD has:

  private final Provider<String> roundPermalinkFormatProvider;

  // All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.

The other branch has:

  // All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.
  private final Provider<String> roundPermalinkFormatProvider;

But the comment is the same. So the conflict is between placing the field before or after the comment. Since the comment is about the delays (which might refer to the fields), it's better to have the comment before the fields it's describing. Therefore, the correct order is comment followed by the field. Hence, we should choose the other branch's version.

So the resolved lines would be:

  // All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.
  private final Provider<String> roundPermalinkFormatProvider;

Thus, merging the two by taking the comment first, then the field, and eliminating the duplicate comment. The other lines (like the 'allowBlankCardsProvider') follow as before.</think>
