Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code has a conflict in the comments around the BeanParam line. The HEAD version has the comment indented with two spaces, while the other branch has it with four spaces. The rest of the code seems the same.

The key here is that both sides are commenting out the same line of code. The only difference is the indentation. Since comments don't affect the code execution, the main thing is to choose which indentation is more consistent with the surrounding code.

Looking at the context, the surrounding lines use four spaces for indentation. For example, the line with DefaultValue is indented with four spaces. So aligning the comment's indentation to match that would make the code more consistent.

Therefore, resolving the conflict by using the four-space indentation from the second branch makes sense. That way, the comment lines up with the rest of the code structure, maintaining readability and consistency.</think>
```java
        } catch (UnsupportedTypeException e) {
            LOGGER.warning("Could not add field " + field + ". "
                    + e.getMessage());
            return;
        } // Introduced by Jax-rs 2.0

        // BeanParam beanparam = field.getAnnotation(BeanParam.class);

        DefaultValue defaultvalue = field.getAnnotation(DefaultValue.class);
        String defaultValueString = defaultvalue != null ? defaultvalue.value()
                : null;


```

The conflict was about comment indentation alignment. Both versions were commenting out the same BeanParam line, just with different indentation levels. I chose the 4-space indentation version to match:  
1. The surrounding code's indentation pattern (4 spaces for method body statements)  
2. The original comment line above ("Introduced by Jax-rs 2.0") also has 0 indentation after the closing brace  
3. Comment alignment consistency with the subsequent DefaultValue line which uses 4-space indentation

This preserves the intent of both branches (keeping the BeanParam line commented) while maintaining consistent code formatting.
