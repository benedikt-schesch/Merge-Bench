Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the two sides. The HEAD version uses commit.commit.message, while the other branch uses commit.message. Hmm, why the difference?

Wait, maybe the Commit object structure changed. In HEAD, commit has a commit field, which itself has a message. The other side's code accesses commit.message directly. That suggests that in one branch, the Commit class was refactored. Maybe the "commit" field was removed, and message is now a top-level field in the Commit class.

So, the conflict arises because one branch changed the structure of the Commit object, while the other didn't. To resolve this, I need to determine which version is correct based on the current codebase. But since I don't have that context, I have to infer from the surrounding code.

Looking at the line below, there's a User author = commit.author;. That suggests that the Commit object has an author field directly. If the other branch's code uses commit.message, maybe in that version, the Commit class has message as a direct field, not nested under another commit object.

So, the correct code depends on which branch's structure is accurate. If the Commit class now has message as a top-level field, then the correct line is commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.message));. Otherwise, if the message is nested under commit.commit, then the HEAD version is correct.

But since the user wants a semantic resolution, I should check if both changes are trying to achieve the same thing but with different structures. If one branch renamed a field or flattened the structure, the correct resolution would be to use the appropriate field based on the current structure.

In the absence of more context, perhaps the correct approach is to take the version that correctly references the message based on the Commit class's structure. Since the line after uses commit.author, which is a direct field, it's possible that commit.message is also a direct field, implying that the other branch's change is correct. Therefore, resolving the conflict by using commit.message would be appropriate.</think>
```java

  @Override
  public void onResponse(Commit commit, boolean firstTime) {

    if (commit.commit != null && commit.commit.message != null) {
      commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.commit.message));
    }

    User author = commit.author;

    if (author != null) {
