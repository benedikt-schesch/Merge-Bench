Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the method signature of registerFunction. The HEAD version uses a String for the functionSpec parameter, while the other branch uses a FuncSpec object. 

Hmm, the comment above mentions that functionSpec is a FuncSpec object representing the name of the function class and arguments. So the incoming change from the branch (1488b22) seems correct because it's using the actual FuncSpec type. The HEAD version might be an older version where perhaps it was a String, but that doesn't align with the comment.

Also, looking at the method body, they check if functionSpec is null, then either remove or put into definedFunctions. The map is probably storing FuncSpec instances. If the HEAD version used a String, then putting a String into a map expecting FuncSpec would cause issues. Therefore, the correct parameter type should be FuncSpec as in the branch version. 

So the resolution is to keep the branch's version of the method signature. The conflict markers should be removed, and the method should take FuncSpec as the parameter type.</think>
```java
     * @param function - the new function alias to define.
     * @param functionSpec - the FuncSpec object representing the name of 
     * the function class and any arguments to constructor.
     * 
     */
    public void registerFunction(String function, FuncSpec functionSpec) {
        if (functionSpec == null) {
            definedFunctions.remove(function);
        } else {
            definedFunctions.put(function, functionSpec);
        }
```
