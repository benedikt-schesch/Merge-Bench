Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code has a conflict between the HEAD and the other branch's version. Both sides are defining a variable called inpLimitLists, but there's a difference in the spacing. The HEAD version has "List<Long> inpLimitLists =" with no space before the equals sign, while the other branch has "List<Long> inpLimitLists = " with a space after the equals sign. 

Wait, actually, looking closer, maybe it's a space after the equals sign. The HEAD version has the equals sign followed by a line break, and the other branch has a space after the equals sign before the line break. But in Java, trailing whitespace usually doesn't matter. The actual code being assigned is the same on both sidesâ€”it's a deserialization of the same configuration property.

So the conflict here is purely stylistic, just a difference in whitespace. Since both changes are trying to achieve the same thing semantically, the intent is identical. The only difference is formatting. In such cases, it's safe to pick either version. But since the code is the same except for the space, maybe the correct resolution is to remove the conflict by choosing one. But which one?

Looking at Java conventions, usually, the equals sign is followed by a space. So the version from the other branch (with the space after =) might be the correct one. However, the original code in HEAD might have a different style. Alternatively, maybe the space is just a typo or an insignificant difference.

But since the user wants to resolve the conflict by considering intent, and both sides are declaring the same variable with the same type and assignment, the conflict is trivial. The correct resolution would be to take one side, preferably the one with the space for consistency if that's the project's style. But since the user hasn't provided style guidelines, either version would work. However, the conflict markers need to be removed. Since there's no semantic difference, resolving by choosing either is okay. 

But wait, maybe the other branch's version has a trailing space that's unnecessary. But in Java, that's not an issue. The code would compile the same way. So the merge conflict can be resolved by keeping one of the versions. Since the user's example shows that the only difference is the space after the equals sign, I can choose the version with the space, as that's more common in Java coding conventions. Alternatively, perhaps the HEAD version is correct. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, since the user says to resolve the conflict if possible, and the intent is the same, the correct approach is to remove the conflict markers and pick one line. 

Therefore, the resolved code would take one of the versions. Let's go with the one that has the space after the equals sign for better readability, as per common Java style guides. So the line would be:

        List<Long> inpLimitLists = 
                (ArrayList<Long>)ObjectSerializer.deserialize(
                        conf.get("pig.inpLimits"));

That way, the conflict is resolved by choosing the version with the space, which is likely the intended change from the other branch. The rest of the code remains the same. So the final code snippet after resolving the conflict would have the line from the other branch, since it's adding a space which is a minor style adjustment, and doesn't affect functionality.</think>
```java
        // for backward compatibility
        PigInputFormat.sJob = conf;

        InputFormat inputFormat = loadFunc.getInputFormat();

        List<Long> inpLimitLists = 
                (ArrayList<Long>)ObjectSerializer.deserialize(
                        conf.get("pig.inpLimits"));

        return new PigRecordReader(inputFormat, pigSplit, loadFunc, context, inpLimitLists.get(pigSplit.getInputIndex()));
    }
```
