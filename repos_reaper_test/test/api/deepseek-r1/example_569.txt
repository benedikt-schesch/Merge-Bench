Okay, let's see. The user provided a Java code snippet with a merge conflict and wants me to resolve it. The conflict is between the HEAD and a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe branches. The conflict is about an import statement. 

In the HEAD version, there's no import of JsonObject.NULL, while the other branch adds that static import. My job is to figure out if these two changes can be merged without issues.

Looking at the import statements, both sides are adding static imports. The HEAD has several imports, and the other branch adds another one: import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.NULL;. Since static imports can coexist as long as they don't conflict, adding this new import from the other branch should be safe. There's no duplication or conflicting imports here. 

So the correct resolution would be to include both imports. The order might not matter, but it's best to keep them in the order they were added. So the merged code should have the NULL import first, then the MAPPER_LOGGER, followed by the others. That way, both changes are incorporated without any issues. I don't see any semantic conflicts here because adding an additional static import doesn't interfere with the existing ones. Therefore, the conflict markers can be removed, and both imports included.</think>

package com.restfb;

import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.NULL;
import static com.restfb.logging.RestFBLogger.MAPPER_LOGGER;
import static com.restfb.util.ReflectionUtils.*;
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.isBlank;
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.trimToEmpty;
import static java.lang.String.format;

``` 

The conflict is resolved by keeping both static imports since they don't conflict semantically. The NULL import from the feature branch is added alongside the existing MAPPER_LOGGER import from HEAD, maintaining alphabetical order of static imports which is a common Java convention. There's no ambiguity since these are independent static imports serving different purposes.
