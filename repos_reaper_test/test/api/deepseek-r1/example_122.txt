Okay, let's see. The user provided a Java code snippet with a merge conflict and wants me to resolve it. The conflict is between two different superclasses for ContentEditorActivity. In the HEAD version, it's extending BackActivity, while in the other branch (f8f91f1d455f6842ca57b8294f6a263ff0cde1e4), it's extending RepositoryThemeActivity. 

First, I need to understand the intent behind both changes. The HEAD branch probably introduced BackActivity as the superclass, maybe for handling back navigation or some common functionality. The other branch uses RepositoryThemeActivity, which might be related to theming or repository-specific features.

Since the user mentioned semantic merge conflicts, I should think about what each side is trying to achieve. If both activities are part of the same hierarchy or if one is a replacement for the other, merging them requires knowing which one is correct. But without additional context, it's ambiguous. 

If RepositoryThemeActivity is a subclass of BackActivity, then using RepositoryThemeActivity might be acceptable as it would include BackActivity's functionality. Alternatively, maybe one of the branches is outdated. However, since the user hasn't provided more context, I can't be certain. 

Since the conflict is about the superclass and there's no clear way to determine which one is correct without more information, the safest approach is to leave the conflict as is. The user should decide which superclass is appropriate based on their project's structure and requirements. Therefore, the resolved code would keep the conflict markers because the intent is ambiguous.</think>
```java
import rx.Subscriber;
import rx.android.schedulers.AndroidSchedulers;
import rx.functions.Func1;
import rx.schedulers.Schedulers;

<<<<<<< HEAD
public class ContentEditorActivity extends BackActivity
=======
public class ContentEditorActivity extends RepositoryThemeActivity
>>>>>>> f8f91f1d455f6842ca57b8294f6a263ff0cde1e4
    implements Toolbar.OnMenuItemClickListener, QueryTokenReceiver, ContentEditorPresenter.Callback {

  public static final String CONTENT = "CONTENT";
  private static final String HINT = "HINT";
  private static final String PREFILL = "PREFILL";
```

I've preserved the conflict because:
1. The base class change represents a fundamental architectural decision
2. Without domain knowledge about the relationship between BackActivity and RepositoryThemeActivity
3. This could impact navigation behavior vs theming/capability inheritance
4. The implements clause remains identical in both versions, showing compatible interfaces

The developer needs to determine whether:
- These activities are in a hierarchy (e.g. RepositoryThemeActivity extends BackActivity)
- If this represents a refactoring/renaming
- Which parent class provides the required functionality for this context
