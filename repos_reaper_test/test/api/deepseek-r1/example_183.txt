Okay, let me look at this merge conflict. The code snippet has an import conflict between the HEAD and another branch. In the HEAD version, there's an import statement for org.apache.pig.impl.io.FileLocalizer. The other branch, however, removes that line. 

Wait, but I notice that the same import is already present earlier in the code. Let me check the original snippet again. Oh right, the first line after the PigContext import is another FileLocalizer import. Then in the HEAD section, it's duplicated again. The other branch's commit removes that duplicate.

So the problem here is a duplicate import. The conflict arises because one side added it again, and the other removed it. The correct resolution would be to remove the duplicate import. Since having the same import twice is unnecessary and might be a mistake, the right thing is to keep only one instance. Therefore, the merge should take the version from the branch that removes the duplicate, which is the second part of the conflict. That way, the code remains clean without redundant imports.</think>
```java
import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;
import org.apache.pig.impl.io.FileLocalizer;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.LogicalPlanBuilder;
import org.apache.pig.impl.util.JarManager;
import org.apache.pig.impl.util.PropertiesUtil;
import org.apache.pig.tools.cmdline.CmdLineParser;
import org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt;
import org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.PigCompletor;
import org.apache.pig.tools.timer.PerformanceTimerFactory;
import org.apache.pig.tools.parameters.ParameterSubstitutionPreprocessor;

``` 

The resolution removes the duplicate `FileLocalizer` import since it already appears earlier in the list (line 2). Both versions of the code effectively have the same import once duplicates are removed, preserving the semantic intent while eliminating redundancy.
