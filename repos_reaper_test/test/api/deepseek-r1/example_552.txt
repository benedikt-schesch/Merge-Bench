Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Javadoc comment for the isNullOrEmpty method. The two versions differ in the @return line. The HEAD version ends with "empty string" and the other branch adds a period at the end. 

Hmm, in Javadoc, it's standard practice to end sentences with periods. The HEAD version is missing the period, while the other branch adds it. The semantic intent of both sides is the sameâ€”they both want to return true if the string is null or empty. The only difference is the punctuation.

Since adding the period is a minor formatting improvement and follows Javadoc conventions, the correct resolution is to take the version with the period. There's no functional conflict here, just a documentation style difference. So I'll keep the context as is but choose the version with the period in the @return line.</think>
```java
     * you won't need special null-safe forms of methods like
     * {@link String#toUpperCase} either.
     * 
     * @param string
     *            a string reference to check
     * @return {@code true} if the string is null or is the empty string.

    public static boolean isNullOrEmpty(String string) {
        return string == null || string.isEmpty();
    }
