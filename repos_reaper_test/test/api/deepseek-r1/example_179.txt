Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The user wants me to resolve it by understanding the semantics and intent of both sides. The code snippet is in Java, and the conflict is between the HEAD and another commit (1488b22). 

Looking at the conflict, the HEAD version has an import statement for org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.parser.QueryParser. The other side adds an import for org.apache.pig.impl.plan.OperatorKey. 

Since Java imports are independent of each other, unless there's a naming conflict, both imports can coexist. The surrounding context doesn't show any changes except these two lines. The rest of the code, like the class comment, remains the same.

So the correct resolution would be to include both imports. The conflict markers should be removed, keeping both import statements. There's no overlap or reason to exclude either. The order might matter for style, but the user didn't specify, so preserving the order from both branches as they appeared makes sense. HEAD's import comes first, then the other commit's import.

I should check if there are any other changes in the context, but the given code snippet only shows these two import lines conflicting. The rest of the code is the same. Therefore, merging both imports is the right approach here. No ambiguity detected. The resolved code should have both imports without conflict markers.</think>
