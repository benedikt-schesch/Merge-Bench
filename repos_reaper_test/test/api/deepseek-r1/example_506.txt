Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict between the HEAD version and the other branch. The HEAD side only has the try-catch block for loading the explosion sound. The other branch adds loading a texture after the try-catch block.

So, the conflict is between adding a sound in one branch and a texture in another. Since these are two separate operations—loading a sound and loading a texture—they probably don't interfere with each other. The intent of both branches is to initialize different resources. Therefore, the correct resolution would be to keep both changes. 

The try-catch block ends with a closing brace, and then the other branch adds loading the texture. So, the code after resolving should first handle the sound, then load the texture. The order might matter, but unless there's a specific reason they can't be together, both should be included. 

I should make sure the syntax is correct. The HEAD doesn't have the texture loading line, and the other branch adds it after the try-catch. So, placing the texture load line after the try-catch block but before the closing method brace makes sense. 

There's no ambiguity here since both changes are in different parts of the code and don't overlap. So the resolved code would include both the sound loading and the texture loading.</think>
```java
		try {
			this.mExplosionSound = SoundFactory.createSoundFromAsset(this.mEngine.getSoundManager(), this, "explosion.ogg");
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```
