Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java imports. Let's look at what's happening here. The HEAD version has some imports, and the other side (from commit 1488b22ce3138...) adds more. The conflict is between the existing imports in HEAD and the new ones added in the other branch.

First, I'll list out the imports from both sides. HEAD has:
- java.io.InputStream
- java.util.HashMap
- java.util.Iterator
- java.util.Map
- java.util.Properties
- junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
- org.junit.Test

The other branch adds:
- java.net.URL
- java.util.List
- java.util.ArrayList
- java.util.Set

So, the goal is to combine these without duplication. Let me check each import. The existing ones from HEAD are all valid. The new ones from the other branch are URL, List, ArrayList, Set. Since these are different from the existing ones, there's no overlap. Therefore, the correct resolution is to include all the imports from both sides, merging them into a single list. There's no ambiguity here because none of the imports conflict; they're all distinct. So the merged code should have all the imports combined, maintaining alphabetical order or the original order as per the existing structure. Since the original order isn't strictly alphabetical, I'll just combine them. So the final imports will include all from both sides without any conflicts.</think>
