<think>
Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the changes from both branches.

In the HEAD version, there's the declaration of the qualifiers array and then the constructor comment starts. The other branch (d543609) adds a new field 'at_timestamp_only' with a comment. The conflict is because both branches are adding different things in the same area.

The HEAD branch doesn't have the new field, while the other branch adds it right after the qualifiers declaration. Since these are separate fields, they can coexist. The correct resolution would be to include both the qualifiers and the new at_timestamp_only field. The order might matter, but looking at the code, the new field is a boolean with a comment, so placing it after the qualifiers makes sense. The conflict markers should be removed, keeping both parts. I should make sure the spacing is preserved as per the original. So the merged code should have the qualifiers declaration, then the new field and its comment from the other branch, followed by the constructor comment. That way both changes are incorporated without ambiguity.</think>
```java

  /** Special value for {@link #family} when deleting a whole row.  */
  static final byte[] WHOLE_ROW = new byte[0];

  private final byte[][] qualifiers;

  /** Whether to delete the value only at the specified timestamp. */
  private boolean at_timestamp_only = false;

  /**
   * Constructor to delete an entire row.
   * <strong>These byte arrays will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @param table The table to edit.
```
