Okay, let's see. I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. The conflict is in the method getClassForAlias. The HEAD version declares String className and funcSpec as null. The other branch declares className as null and funcSpec as a FuncSpec type initialized to null.

First, I should understand what both sides are trying to do. The HEAD side has funcSpec as a String, maybe? Or maybe it's a typo. Wait, looking at the code after the conflict: in both cases, they check if funcSpec is not null. Then, in the HEAD version, perhaps funcSpec was a String, but in the other branch, it's a FuncSpec object. That's a significant difference.

Wait, the line after the conflict: if (funcSpec != null) { ... }. So both versions are using funcSpec, but in HEAD, funcSpec is a String, and in the other branch, it's a FuncSpec. That might affect how the code works. The other branch's change is more substantial because it changes the type of funcSpec from String to FuncSpec. 

Looking at the surrounding code: definedFunctions is a map that's being queried with the alias. In HEAD, definedFunctions.get(alias) returns a String (funcSpec is String), but in the other branch, it's a FuncSpec. So the type of definedFunctions must have changed between the branches. 

The conflict arises because one branch changed the type of funcSpec. Merging these would require reconciling the type. However, since the two changes are incompatible (different types for funcSpec), simply combining the declarations won't work. 

Wait, the user wants a semantic merge. So maybe the correct resolution is to take the version that uses FuncSpec, as that's a more specific type, assuming that the other branch introduced a new class FuncSpec. The HEAD version might have had funcSpec as a String, but the other branch refactored it to use a FuncSpec object. Therefore, the correct merge would be to take the incoming change from the other branch, which changes funcSpec to be of type FuncSpec and initializes it to null. The className is declared as String className = null in the other branch, which might be a good practice to initialize explicitly, whereas HEAD had it uninitialized. However, in Java, local variables must be initialized before use, so the other branch's approach is correct. 

Therefore, the resolved code should take the second version: declare className as String = null and funcSpec as FuncSpec = null. That would fix the initialization issue and the type change. So the merged code would have both declarations from the second branch. The conflict markers are removed, and the code uses the FuncSpec type. 

So replacing the conflict lines with the second version's declarations. The rest of the code remains the same. The surrounding context is preserved, and the spacing is kept as is.</think>
