Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The code in question is a Java method that's handling some game state logic. The conflict is between the HEAD version and a commit labeled 5adedd2. 

Looking at the conflicting lines, both versions are logging a message using logger.info. The difference is in the formatting of the string passed to String.format. The HEAD version has the message split into two lines with a line break after the opening parenthesis, while the other version has it all on one line.

The key here is to determine if the line break is significant or just a formatting preference. Since Java allows splitting string literents across lines as long as they're properly concatenated, but in this case, the string is a single literal split by a line break. Wait, no—actually, looking closer, the HEAD version has the string split into two lines without a concatenation operator. That would actually cause a compile error because in Java, a string literal can't be split across lines like that without using + to concatenate.

Wait, let me check again. The HEAD code is:

logger.info(String.format(
    "Resetting game %d due to insufficient players after removing %d idle players.",
    id, playersToRemove.size()));

And the other branch is:

logger.info(String.format("Resetting game %d due to insufficient players after removing %d idle players.", id, playersToRemove.size()));

So the HEAD version has the format string split into two lines, but since it's within the same set of quotes, that's not valid Java syntax. Wait, no—the line break inside the string literal would actually be part of the string, which is probably not intended. But looking at the code, the HEAD version's String.format call is split across two lines, but the string itself is a single line. Wait, no—the opening quote is on the first line, then the next line is the continuation of the string. But in Java, that's not allowed. You can't have a string literal span multiple lines without closing the quotes and using + to concatenate.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding the code. Let me look again. The HEAD version's code is:

logger.info(String.format(
    "Resetting game %d due to insufficient players after removing %d idle players.",
    id, playersToRemove.size()));

So the first line is String.format(, then the second line is the format string, followed by the arguments. The string itself is on a single line, just split across two lines in the code for readability. But the actual string doesn't have a line break. Oh wait, no—the way it's written in the HEAD version, the string is split into two lines in the source code. That would result in a compile error because in Java, a string literal cannot be split across lines without using + to concatenate. So the HEAD version's code is actually invalid Java syntax. The other version, on the other hand, has the entire string on one line, which is correct.

Therefore, the commit from 5adedd2 is correcting a syntax error by putting the entire format string on one line. The HEAD version's code is broken. So the correct resolution is to take the version from the other branch, which fixes the syntax error. The intent of both branches is to log the message, but the HEAD version has a syntax error. Therefore, the correct merge is to use the single-line string to avoid the compile error.

So the resolved code should use the version from 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a, replacing the HEAD version. Therefore, the conflict markers should be removed, and the line from the other branch should be kept.</think>
```java

    synchronized (playedCards) {
      if (state == GameState.PLAYING || playersToRemove.size() == 0) {
        // not sure how much of this check is actually required
        if (players.size() < 3 || playedCards.size() < 2) {
          logger.info(String.format("Resetting game %d due to insufficient players after removing %d idle players.", id, playersToRemove.size()));
          resetState(true);
        } else {
          judgingState();
        }
      }
