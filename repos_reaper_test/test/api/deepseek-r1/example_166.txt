Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The user provided a Java import section with a conflict between HEAD and another branch. The conflict is about adding an import for java.util.List.

First, I need to look at both sides. The HEAD version doesn't have the import for List, while the other branch (1488b22) adds it. The goal is to resolve this by including both necessary imports without duplication.

Looking at the existing imports: there's java.util.ArrayList, which is part of the List hierarchy. Since ArrayList implements List, if the code uses List somewhere, it's necessary to import it. The other branch is adding that import.

Now, checking if there's any duplication. The existing imports include ArrayList, but not List. So adding the List import from the other branch is safe. There's no conflicting import here, just an additional one.

The conflict markers are around the import lines. The correct resolution would be to include both the existing imports from HEAD and the new import from the other branch. Since the order might not matter, but typically imports are sorted, but the user's existing order has ArrayList before Random. The conflicting import for List is added in the other branch. So merging them by including the List import.

So the resolved code should have both imports: java.util.ArrayList and java.util.List. Therefore, the conflict markers can be removed, keeping the List import from the other branch and preserving the existing ones from HEAD.

No ambiguity here since both changes are adding necessary imports, and they don't conflict with each other. So the final code will include all the necessary imports without any duplicates.</think>
