Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java imports between the HEAD version and the a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe branch. 

Looking at the HEAD side, they have "import com.restfb.json.*;" which imports all classes from the com.restfb.json package. Then they import "com.restfb.types.Comments;" directly.

On the other side, the branch is importing specific classes from com.restfb.json: JsonArray, JsonException, JsonObject. And for the Comments class, it's "com.restfb.types.Post.Comments;", which suggests that Comments is an inner class of Post in that branch.

So the conflict is between using a wildcard import for json classes versus explicit ones, and the location of the Comments class.

First, for the json imports: Using wildcard imports can be frowned upon in some coding standards because it's less explicit. The branch side is explicitly importing the needed classes. If both sides added different classes, we need to check if there's any overlap or if all are needed. The HEAD uses the wildcard, which includes all, but the branch lists specific ones. If the specific ones are the only ones needed, maybe it's better to list them explicitly. But if the HEAD's wildcard is necessary for other classes not listed in the branch, then we might need both. However, in merge conflicts, we usually take both changes. Wait, but the conflict is between the two versions. So the HEAD has the wildcard, and the branch has specific imports. Since they are modifying the same line, we need to decide which one to keep.

Alternatively, maybe the branch is adding more specific imports, replacing the wildcard. But in Java, if you import specific classes, you don't need the wildcard. So if the branch is replacing the wildcard with explicit imports, we should take the explicit ones. But we need to check if all necessary classes are covered. The HEAD's wildcard would include JsonException, JsonObject, JsonArray, etc., and the branch's explicit imports include those three. So maybe the branch is refactoring to avoid wildcard imports. In that case, taking the explicit imports from the branch is better.

Then, for the Comments import: HEAD has com.restfb.types.Comments, while the branch has com.restfb.types.Post.Comments. This suggests that in one branch, Comments is a top-level class, and in the other, it's an inner class of Post. That's a more significant conflict. This could be due to a refactoring where Comments was moved into Post or vice versa. 

If both changes are valid, depending on the codebase's current state, we need to know which one is correct. Since this is a merge conflict, the resolver needs to determine which import is correct. If the code in the rest of the file uses Comments as a top-level class, then the HEAD version is correct. If it's used as Post.Comments, then the branch version is correct. Without more context, it's hard to tell. But since this is a conflict, the user might expect us to resolve it by choosing the correct one. However, if we can't determine, we should leave the conflict. But the user asked to resolve if possible based on intent.

Alternatively, maybe the two changes are compatible. For example, maybe the Comments class was moved in one branch, and the other branch added the wildcard. But that's unlikely. So, in this case, the two changes are conflicting.

But the user wants us to resolve semantically. Let's think: if one side is importing specific json classes and the other uses wildcard, but the specific ones are a subset, then combining them would be redundant. So we should pick either the wildcard or the specific imports. If the branch's intention was to replace the wildcard with explicit imports (best practice), then we should take the explicit ones. So for the json imports, take the branch's lines.

For the Comments import: if one branch moved the Comments into Post, and the other kept it as a top-level class, this is a breaking change. Without knowing which is correct, it's ambiguous. However, in the branch's version, the import is Post.Comments, which suggests that the Comments class is now an inner class of Post. If the HEAD version is older and the branch is newer, maybe the Comments was moved. But again, without context, it's hard. Since the user asked to resolve if possible, maybe we can check if both imports are needed. But in Java, you can't have both. So it's a conflict unless one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the two changes are independent: the json imports and the Comments import. But they are in the same conflict block. So the user has both changes conflicting.

Wait, looking at the code:

The HEAD has:
import com.restfb.json.*;
import com.restfb.types.Comments;

The branch has:
import com.restfb.json.JsonArray;
import com.restfb.json.JsonException;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
import com.restfb.types.Post.Comments;

So, the conflict is between the two sets of imports. The solution would be to take the explicit json imports from the branch (since they are more specific and replace the wildcard) and then decide which Comments import is correct. If both branches are adding different Comments imports, and only one is correct, we need to choose. But without knowing the code structure, perhaps the correct approach is to take both changes. Wait, but in the code, the lines are in conflict. So the user is probably moving from using the wildcard to specific imports, and also changing the Comments import location. If the branch is the incoming change, maybe that's the intended one. Alternatively, perhaps the Comments import in the branch is correct because it's part of Post now. But again, without knowing the code, it's ambiguous.

But the user wants us to resolve based on intent and semantics. The branch might have a more specific import for Comments, indicating that the class structure changed. If we can assume that the branch is correct in moving Comments into Post, then we should take that. Alternatively, maybe the HEAD is adding a new import for Comments as a top-level class, while the branch has it under Post. This is a real conflict. If we can't resolve it, we should leave the conflict markers. But the user wants us to try.

Alternatively, maybe both imports are needed. But in Java, you can't import two classes with the same simple name unless you use fully qualified names in the code. So if the code uses Comments, and both a top-level and an inner class exist, that would cause a conflict. But in the given code, it's an import conflict. So perhaps one of the imports is correct, and the other is outdated.

Since this is a merge conflict, the correct resolution depends on which change is the correct one. If we can't determine, we should leave the conflict. But the user is asking to resolve if possible. If the branch's version is more recent, perhaps that's the intended one. Alternatively, maybe the Comments class was moved, and both changes are incompatible. 

In this case, perhaps the best way is to take the explicit json imports from the branch and the Comments import from the branch as well, assuming that the branch is the incoming change that correctly moved Comments into Post. So the resolved code would have the three explicit json imports and the Post.Comments import. Alternatively, if the HEAD's Comments import is correct, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the Comments import from both sides are different, but perhaps the correct one is the HEAD's. However, without knowing, this is a guess. But since the user asked to resolve based on intent and semantics, perhaps the branch's change is more precise (explicit imports) and the Comments is now part of Post. So the resolution would be to take the branch's imports for both json and Comments.

So the resolved code would be:

import com.restfb.json.JsonArray;
import com.restfb.json.JsonException;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
import com.restfb.types.Post.Comments;

Thus, merging both changes by replacing the wildcard with explicit imports and using the Post.Comments import from the branch.</think>
