Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java code between the HEAD version and the other branch. Both sides are trying to add a video to an adapter, but they're using different adapter types.

In the HEAD version, they're using SortedArrayObjectAdapter. The other branch uses SortedObjectAdapter. I need to figure out which one is correct or if they can be reconciled. 

First, I should check if these adapters are compatible. Maybe one is a subclass of the other, or perhaps they have the same interface. If both adapters have an add method that works the same way, maybe the code can be adjusted to use a common type.

Looking at the constructors: HEAD's SortedArrayObjectAdapter takes a comparator and a presenter. The other branch's SortedObjectAdapter does the same. So maybe SortedObjectAdapter is a superclass or a renamed class. Alternatively, one might be a replacement for the other due to a refactor.

If the project recently renamed SortedObjectAdapter to SortedArrayObjectAdapter, then the HEAD version is the correct one. Alternatively, if the other branch introduced a new SortedObjectAdapter that's supposed to replace the old one, then maybe that's the right choice.

But without more context, it's hard to know. The user might have intended to switch to SortedObjectAdapter in the branch, while the HEAD still uses SortedArrayObjectAdapter. Since both changes are in the same part of the code, it's a conflict that can't be automatically resolved without knowing the intent.

Since the user said to resolve based on semantics and intent, but here both adapters are similar, maybe the correct approach is to choose one. But if the two adapters are incompatible, merging them would cause errors. However, since the user is an expert, maybe they intended to replace SortedArrayObjectAdapter with SortedObjectAdapter. Alternatively, maybe one branch is outdated.

Wait, the else block creates a new adapter. In HEAD, when creating a new row, it's SortedArrayObjectAdapter, while the other branch uses SortedObjectAdapter. If the code is supposed to use the same adapter type in both cases, then the conflict is because one branch changed the type in both places, and the other didn't. But here, the adapter types in the if and else are different between the branches.

Wait, in the HEAD version, the if block casts to SortedArrayObjectAdapter, and the else creates SortedArrayObjectAdapter. In the other branch, the if block casts to SortedObjectAdapter, and the else creates SortedObjectAdapter. So each branch is consistently using their own adapter type. Therefore, the conflict is due to a rename or a change in the adapter type used.

If the two branches are modifying the same lines to use different adapter types, this is a semantic conflict. The resolver needs to determine which adapter is correct. Since the user can't provide more context, and the problem states to resolve if possible, but if unsure, leave the conflict.

But the user is asking me to resolve it if possible. Maybe the correct approach is to check if SortedObjectAdapter is a superclass of SortedArrayObjectAdapter. If so, casting to the superclass would work. Alternatively, maybe one branch is a refactor.

Alternatively, perhaps the two adapters are the same, but one branch has a typo. But SortedArrayObjectAdapter vs SortedObjectAdapter are different names. Without knowing which is correct, it's ambiguous. Therefore, the conflict cannot be safely resolved automatically. So the correct answer is to leave the conflict as is, since the intent is unclear.</think>
```java
                    ListRow row = findListRow(category);

                    // if found add this video
                    // if not, create a new row and add it
                    if (row != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
                        ((SortedArrayObjectAdapter) row.getAdapter()).add(video);
                    } else {
                        SortedArrayObjectAdapter listRowAdapter = new SortedArrayObjectAdapter(
=======
                        ((SortedObjectAdapter) row.getAdapter()).add(video);
                    } else {
                        SortedObjectAdapter listRowAdapter = new SortedObjectAdapter(
>>>>>>> 308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5
                                videoNameComparator, mCardPresenter);
                        listRowAdapter.add(video);

                        HeaderItem header = new HeaderItem(0, category, null);
                        mAdapter.add(0, new ListRow(header, listRowAdapter));
``` 

The conflict remains unresolved due to ambiguous intent - both sides appear to be using different adapter implementations (`SortedArrayObjectAdapter` vs `SortedObjectAdapter`) that likely represent different semantic approaches to sorting/adapting. Without additional context about which adapter type the system should use, this represents a true semantic conflict that requires human judgment to resolve.
