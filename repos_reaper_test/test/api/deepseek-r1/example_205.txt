Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java imports. The HEAD version includes ExecPhysicalPlan and MapReduceLauncher, while the other branch adds BinStorage and removes some others.

First, I need to check if the imports are being added or removed. The HEAD side has ExecPhysicalPlan and JOB_STATUS from ExecJob, and MapReduceLauncher. The other side has JOB_STATUS but also adds BinStorage and removes ExecPhysicalPlan and MapReduceLauncher.

Wait, in the HEAD, they import ExecPhysicalPlan and JOB_STATUS as separate lines. The other branch imports JOB_STATUS from ExecJob, which is the same as the HEAD's second import. So JOB_STATUS is present in both, so we can keep that once.

Then, the HEAD has MapReduceLauncher import, and the other branch doesn't. The other branch adds BinStorage. So maybe both imports are needed. The conflict is between the two sets of imports.

The correct resolution would be to include all necessary imports without duplication. So combining both sides: keep ExecPhysicalPlan, MapReduceLauncher from HEAD, and add BinStorage from the other branch. Also, since JOB_STATUS is imported in both, we only need it once.

So the merged imports should be:

import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecException;
import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecJob;
import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecPhysicalPlan;
import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecJob.JOB_STATUS;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapreduceExec.MapReduceLauncher;
import org.apache.pig.builtin.BinStorage;
import org.apache.pig.builtin.PigStorage;

That way, all the necessary imports from both branches are included. Checking for duplicates, JOB_STATUS is imported once. So the conflict markers can be removed, and the imports ordered appropriately, perhaps alphabetically or as per the original order, but the user said to preserve spacing. Looking at the original code, the order might be important. The HEAD has ExecPhysicalPlan, then JOB_STATUS, then MapReduceLauncher. The other branch has JOB_STATUS and BinStorage. So combining them in order, keeping the HEAD's order but adding BinStorage where the other branch placed it.

Wait, the original code after the conflict is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecPhysicalPlan;
import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecJob.JOB_STATUS;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapreduceExec.MapReduceLauncher;
=======
import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecJob.JOB_STATUS;
import org.apache.pig.builtin.BinStorage;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309

So in the merged code, we need to include both the ExecPhysicalPlan, JOB_STATUS, MapReduceLauncher from HEAD, and BinStorage from the other branch. The JOB_STATUS is already in both, so we can include it once. So the merged lines would be:

import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecPhysicalPlan;
import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecJob.JOB_STATUS;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapreduceExec.MapReduceLauncher;
import org.apache.pig.builtin.BinStorage;

But in the original code, the order might matter. The HEAD's order is ExecPhysicalPlan, then JOB_STATUS, then MapReduceLauncher. The other branch replaces those lines with JOB_STATUS and BinStorage. But since BinStorage is a different package, it's okay to add it after. So the merged imports should have all of them, combining both sides. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by including all the imports from both branches, removing duplicates. So the final imports would be the union of both sets, maintaining the order from HEAD and adding the new import from the other branch.

Therefore, the resolved code would have:

import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecPhysicalPlan;
import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecJob.JOB_STATUS;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapreduceExec.MapReduceLauncher;
import org.apache.pig.builtin.BinStorage;

So replacing the conflict markers with these four lines. The original context before and after the conflict markers should remain as is. So the final code snippet would merge both sets of imports.</think>
