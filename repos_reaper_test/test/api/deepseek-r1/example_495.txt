Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the changes. The conflict is between HEAD and the other branch regarding the texture loading.

In HEAD, the code is loading this.mBitmapTexture, while in the other branch, it's this.mBitmapTextureAtlas. The method called is loadTexture, which probably takes a texture object. 

I should figure out which one is correct. Maybe the variable name was changed in one branch. If one branch renamed the variable from mBitmapTexture to mBitmapTextureAtlas, then the correct one would be the latter. Alternatively, perhaps the other branch introduced a texture atlas instead of a single texture.

Looking at the surrounding context, the variable names should be consistent. If the other branch is using a texture atlas, maybe that's part of a larger change where they switched from individual textures to an atlas. The HEAD might be outdated. Alternatively, maybe the method expects a texture atlas, so the correct variable is mBitmapTextureAtlas.

If both changes are valid but conflicting, I need to check the intent. If the variable name was updated in one branch, that's the correct one. But if both exist and are used elsewhere, perhaps it's a conflict. However, without more context, the safest assumption is that one branch renamed the variable. Since the other branch uses Atlas, which is a common term for a collection of textures, maybe that's the intended change. So I should pick the version with mBitmapTextureAtlas.</think>
```java

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
