Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. So, looking at the code snippet, there's a conflict in the variable declarations. The HEAD side has a BitmapTexture called mBitmapTexture, while the other branch has a BitmapTextureAtlas named mBitmapTextureAtlas. Both are followed by a TextureRegion variable, mFaceTextureRegion.

Hmm, I need to understand what each side is doing. BitmapTexture and BitmapTextureAtlas might be related but different classes. Maybe one is a more recent change where they refactored the code to use an atlas instead of a single texture. Or perhaps different features were added in each branch that use different types.

Looking at the surrounding context, there's a Camera and Scene, which might be part of a graphics or game framework. The MenuScene suggests it's part of a UI or menu system. The TextureRegion could be part of either the BitmapTexture or the BitmapTextureAtlas, depending on how the framework works.

If the intent is that one branch replaced BitmapTexture with BitmapTextureAtlas, then keeping the latter makes sense. Alternatively, maybe both variables are needed if they serve different purposes. But the conflict is in the same place, so it's likely that one was modified to use the atlas instead of the regular texture.

Since the two changes are conflicting on the same line, it's probably a case where one branch renamed or changed the type. If the correct approach is to use the atlas, then resolving it by choosing BitmapTextureAtlas would be right. But without more context, it's a bit risky. However, the user asked to resolve based on intent and semantics. If both branches are modifying the same line for the same purpose, the correct resolution would be to pick the appropriate one. Since the conflict markers are around these variables, and assuming that the atlas is the newer or correct version, the merge should take the BitmapTextureAtlas from the incoming branch. But I need to make sure that the TextureRegion is compatible. In some frameworks, a TextureRegion is part of an atlas, so if the other branch is adding that, then using the atlas makes sense. Therefore, resolving the conflict by selecting the BitmapTextureAtlas and keeping the TextureRegion as is would be the correct merge. So the resolved code would have the mBitmapTextureAtlas declaration from the lower part and remove the conflict markers.</think>
```java

	protected Camera mCamera;

	protected Scene mMainScene;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	protected MenuScene mMenuScene;
