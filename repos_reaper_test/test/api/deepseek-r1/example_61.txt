Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java code between the declarations of two ArrayLists. The HEAD version uses the older syntax with explicit type parameters in the ArrayList constructors, specifying `<User>` and `<Player>`. The other branch, from commit 5adedd2, uses the diamond operator `<>` which is allowed in Java 7 and later, allowing the compiler to infer the type.

First, I need to understand if there's a semantic difference here. Both versions are declaring the same types for the lists. The diamond operator is just a shorthand and doesn't change the actual type of the list. So both sides are trying to create an ArrayList of User and an ArrayList of Player. The intent is the same; it's just a syntax preference.

Now, looking at the surrounding code, there's no other changes in the conflict area. The rest of the code is the same. So the conflict is purely about whether to use the explicit type parameters or the diamond operator.

Since Java 7+ allows the diamond operator, using `<>` is more concise and reduces redundancy. The branch using the diamond operator is probably updating the code to use modern Java conventions, while the HEAD version might be from an older codebase that hasn't adopted the diamond operator yet.

The correct resolution here would be to accept the diamond operator from the incoming branch (5adedd2) because it's syntactically correct and aligns with current best practices. There's no functional difference, so merging by choosing the diamond operator version should be safe.

I should make sure that only the conflicting lines are resolved, keeping the rest of the context as is. The synchronized block and the loop that follows are unchanged, so no modifications there. The key is to remove the conflict markers and keep the version with the diamond operator.</think>

  private void skipIdlePlayers() {
    killRoundTimer();
    final List<User> playersToRemove = new ArrayList<>();
    final List<Player> playersToUpdateStatus = new ArrayList<>();
    synchronized (roundPlayers) {

      for (final Player player : roundPlayers) {
        final List<WhiteCard> cards = playedCards.getCards(player);
        if (cards == null || cards.size() < blackCard.getPick()) {
