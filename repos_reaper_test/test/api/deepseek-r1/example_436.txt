Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The user wants me to resolve it by understanding the intent of both sides. The conflict is in a Java method, probably in an Android fragment or activity. Both sides are trying to unregister receivers in the onStop method.

In the HEAD version, there's a try-catch block unregistering videoUpdateReceiver. The other branch (308db82) has a similar block for libraryUpdateReceiver. The conflict arises because both changes are adding unregister calls, but they're for different receivers.

The original code probably had one unregister call, and each branch added another. Since they're different receivers, both should be kept. The correct resolution is to include both try-catch blocks. The order might matter, but unless there's a specific reason, keeping both in the order they appeared in the conflict makes sense. The super.onStop() call should come after both, as in both versions.

So, the resolved code should have both try blocks, one after the other, followed by super.onStop(). That way, both receivers are unregistered, and the conflict is resolved without ambiguity.</think>
```java
        try {
            getActivity().unregisterReceiver(videoUpdateReceiver);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            // do nothing
        }
        try {
            getActivity().unregisterReceiver(libraryUpdateReceiver);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            // do nothing
        }
        super.onStop();
    }

    @Override
    public void onAddClicked(CharSequence user, CharSequence password,
``` 

Rationale: Both sides are attempting to safely unregister different BroadcastReceivers before calling super.onStop(). Since these are distinct receivers (videoUpdateReceiver vs libraryUpdateReceiver), both unregister calls should be preserved. The order of unregistration doesn't appear semantically significant here, and both exception handlers serve the same safety purpose.
