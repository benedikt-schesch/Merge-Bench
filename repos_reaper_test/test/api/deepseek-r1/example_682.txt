Okay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this merge conflict. So, looking at the code snippet, the conflict is in the 'text' variable assignment. Both versions are trying to create a message about ambiguous principals, but there are some differences.

First, the HEAD version says "resource access permissions or node ownership" while the other branch uses "grants or node ownership". I need to determine which term is more accurate. Maybe "grants" is a broader term that includes permissions, or perhaps "resource access permissions" is more specific. If both are correct but different, maybe combine them? But wait, maybe one is more up-to-date. Let me check the context. The message is about ambiguity during deployment. If the other branch changed it to "grants", maybe that's the intended term now. Or perhaps "grants" is a technical term used elsewhere in the codebase. I'm not sure, but maybe "grants" is the newer term.

Next, the HEAD version uses String.join to create the list items, while the other branch uses a stream with sorted().collect(). The stream approach sorts the ambiguousPrincipals, which would present them in alphabetical order. That's probably a good improvement because sorted lists are easier to read. So keeping the sorted stream makes sense.

Then, the HEAD version ends the sentence with a period, and the other branch uses an exclamation mark. The exclamation might add emphasis, but I should check if that's consistent with other messages. If the original had a period, maybe the exclamation is too strong. But maybe the conflict arises because one side added the exclamation for urgency. Without more context, it's hard to say, but perhaps the exclamation is intentional.

Putting this together, the resolved code should take the "grants or node ownership" from the other branch, include the sorted stream, and keep the exclamation mark. The rest of the context, like the title and logger info, seems the same. So the merged text variable would combine the changes from both branches where possible.

Wait, but the message parts: the first part of the text in HEAD is "For the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for resource access permissions or node ownership during <b>deployment</b>.<br>" and the other branch has "grants or node ownership". Since grants might be a synonym for permissions here, maybe "grants" is the preferred term. So replacing "resource access permissions" with "grants" is acceptable.

So the merged text would be the other branch's version but ensuring that the message makes sense. Also, the sorted stream is better for readability. The exclamation mark might be a stylistic choice, but since it's part of the branch's change, it should be included if that's the intended resolution.

Therefore, the resolved code should take the changes from the second branch (83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965) for the text variable, including the sorted stream and the exclamation mark, and discard the HEAD version. That way, we keep the improved sorting and the updated terminology.</think>
```java
			}

			if (!ambiguousPrincipals.isEmpty()) {

				final String title = "Ambiguous Principal(s)";
				final String text = "For the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for grants or node ownership during <b>deployment</b>.<br>"
						+ "Because of this ambiguity, <b>node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported</b>!"
						+ "<ul><li>" + ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>")) + "</li></ul>"
						+ "Consider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.";

				logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
						+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"

``` 

The resolution combines the strongest elements from both versions:
1. Uses "grants" from the incoming branch as a more general term that likely aligns with current domain language
2. Keeps the stream+sorted+collect pattern from the incoming branch for consistent sorting
3. Maintains the exclamation mark from the incoming branch for emphasis
4. Preserves the core warning structure both versions agree on
5. Maintains identical logging context and HTML markup structure

The conflict is resolvable because both versions share the same fundamental intent - to warn about ambiguous principals during deployment. The differences are in presentation details rather than semantic meaning.
