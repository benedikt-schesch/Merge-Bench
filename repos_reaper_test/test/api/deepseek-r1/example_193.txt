Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the changes from both branches.

In the HEAD version, they're converting the args list to a String array using toArray(new String[0]). Then they create an Object array wrappedArgs with size 1 and assign the first element to argArr. 

In the other branch (1488b22), they directly assign args to wrappedArgs[0] without converting it to a String array. Wait, but args is probably a List<String> or similar, since in HEAD they're calling toArray on it. 

The constructor being called is getConstructor(String[].class), which expects a single parameter of type String[]. So when creating the Object array wrappedArgs, the first element should be a String array. 

In the HEAD branch, they correctly convert args to a String array. The other branch is passing args directly, which might be a List, leading to a type mismatch. That would cause a runtime error because the constructor expects a String array, not a List. 

So the correct approach is to use the HEAD version, converting args to a String array. The other branch's change is incorrect because it doesn't convert the list to an array. Therefore, the resolution should keep the HEAD code. 

Wait, but maybe the other branch's args is already a String array? Let me check the context. The code in HEAD has args.toArray, which suggests args is a collection, like a List<String>. So converting it to a String array is necessary. The other branch is trying to pass args directly, which would be a List, not a String array. That's a problem. 

Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the HEAD version. The conflict markers should be removed, keeping the code that converts args to a String array and wraps it correctly.</think>

        }
        catch(NoSuchMethodException nme) {
            // Second channce. Try with var arg constructor
            try {
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(String[].class);
                String[] argArr = args.toArray(new String[0]) ;
                Object[] wrappedArgs = new Object[1] ;
                wrappedArgs[0] = argArr ;
                ret =  c.newInstance(wrappedArgs);
            }
            catch(Throwable e){
                // bad luck
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
