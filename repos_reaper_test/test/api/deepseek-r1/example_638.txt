<think>
Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in a Java class, specifically around the declarations of some fields. The two branches have different versions of the contentType and fieldName variables.

In the HEAD version, the contentType is declared without an initial value, and then there's a @Getter annotation followed by the fieldName. In the other branch (a17acec), the contentType is initialized to null, and the fieldName line is present but without the @Getter annotation above it. Wait, no, looking again: the conflict markers show that in the HEAD side, there's a @Getter above fieldName, and in the other side, after contentType = null, the fieldName is declared with the @Getter. Wait, let me parse the code again.

The conflict is between:

HEAD:
  private String contentType;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

And the other branch:
  private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

Wait, no. The code as presented has:

<<<<<<< HEAD
  private String contentType;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;
=======
  private String contentType = null;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

Wait, so in the HEAD, the lines are:
- private String contentType;
- @Getter
- private String fieldName;

In the other branch, the lines are:
- private String contentType = null;
And then after the conflict marker, the code continues with:
  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

So the conflict is that in HEAD, contentType is declared without an initial value, and the @Getter is on fieldName. In the other branch, contentType is initialized to null, and then the @Getter is on fieldName as well. Wait, but in the code after the conflict, the @Getter and fieldName are present in both cases. Wait, the code after the conflict markers shows that both sides have the @Getter and fieldName. Wait, the way the conflict is presented is that the HEAD has the contentType declaration, then @Getter and fieldName. The other side has contentType = null, and then outside the conflict, the @Getter and fieldName are present. Hmm, perhaps the conflict is only on the contentType line and the presence of the @Getter in HEAD versus not in the other branch? Or maybe the other branch's code after the conflict includes the @Getter and fieldName. Let me look again.

The full code snippet is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
  private String contentType;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;
=======
  private String contentType = null;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

So in the HEAD, the lines are:
private String contentType;
@Getter
private String fieldName;

In the other branch, the lines are:
private String contentType = null;

And then after the conflict marker, the code continues with:
  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

Wait, but that would mean that in the other branch, after setting contentType to null, they also have the @Getter and fieldName. But the HEAD side also has the @Getter and fieldName. So the conflict is between the two versions of contentType (with or without initial null) and the placement of the @Getter annotation.

Wait, but looking at the code after the conflict, both sides have the @Getter and fieldName. So maybe the conflict is only about the contentType line. The HEAD version declares contentType without an initial value, while the other branch initializes it to null. Then, both have the @Getter on fieldName. But in the conflict, the other branch's code after the conflict marker includes the @Getter and fieldName again. Wait, that's confusing. Let me parse the exact lines.

The code as presented is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
  private String contentType;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;
=======
  private String contentType = null;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

So in the HEAD, the lines between <<<<<<< and ======= are:
private String contentType;
@Getter
private String fieldName;

In the other branch (between ======= and >>>>>>>), the line is:
private String contentType = null;

Then, after the conflict marker, the code continues with:

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

But that seems like the code after the conflict in the other branch would have the @Getter and fieldName duplicated. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the code in the other branch is that after setting contentType to null, they have the @Getter and fieldName. But in the current code, the conflict is that the HEAD has the @Getter and fieldName inside the conflict section, and the other branch has the @Getter and fieldName outside the conflict. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to reconstruct the original files.

Original HEAD version:

The code before the conflict starts with:

  private byte[] data;

  private InputStream dataStream;

  private String contentType;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

  /**
  
Then, the other branch's version would have:

  private byte[] data;

  private InputStream dataStream;

  private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

  /**
  
So when merging, the conflict arises because both branches modified the same area. The HEAD added the @Getter above fieldName and declared contentType without initialization. The other branch initialized contentType to null and perhaps added the @Getter as well, but maybe in a different position.

Wait, but looking at the conflict markers again, the other branch's code (after =======) is only the line private String contentType = null; and then the >>>>>>> line. Then, after that, the code continues with:

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

  /**

So that suggests that in the other branch's file, after the line private String contentType = null;, there is the @Getter and fieldName. But in the HEAD's version, the @Getter and fieldName are part of the conflict. So when merging, the conflict is between the HEAD's three lines (contentType, @Getter, fieldName) and the other branch's one line (contentType = null) followed by the same @Getter and fieldName.

Wait, but that would mean that in the other branch, the @Getter and fieldName are present both inside and outside the conflict? That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in how the conflict is presented.

Alternatively, perhaps the code in the other branch after the conflict marker is not part of the conflict. Let me think again. The code snippet given is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
  private String contentType;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;
=======
  private String contentType = null;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

So the code from the other branch (a17acec) is only the line private String contentType = null; and then after the conflict is resolved, the code continues with the @Getter and fieldName. But wait, that would mean that the other branch's version has the contentType line, and then the @Getter and fieldName are after the conflict, which would be part of the base code. That's possible if, for example, in the other branch, the @Getter and fieldName were added outside the conflicting region.

Alternatively, perhaps the conflict is that the HEAD has contentType without initialization and the @Getter on fieldName, while the other branch has contentType initialized to null, and the @Getter on fieldName is present in both branches but outside the conflict. Wait, that's not possible because the conflict markers include the @Getter in the HEAD's version but not in the other branch's version. Hmm.

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to outline both versions:

In HEAD:
- private String contentType;
- @Getter
- private String fieldName;

In the other branch:
- private String contentType = null;
- @Getter
- private String fieldName;

So the conflict is between the two versions of contentType (with or without = null) and the @Getter placement. But in the code after the conflict, both have the @Getter and fieldName. Wait, but in the presented code, after resolving the conflict, the code has the @Getter and fieldName again. So maybe the user's code had a duplication here. That's possible if the merge resulted in both branches adding the same lines, leading to a conflict.

Wait, but looking at the full context, the original code after the conflict is:

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

  /**

Which is present in both branches. So perhaps the conflict is only about the contentType line and the @Getter line. Let me check.

In the HEAD, the lines are:

private String contentType;

@Getter
private String fieldName;

In the other branch, the lines are:

private String contentType = null;

Then, after the conflict, there's another @Getter and fieldName. So that would result in duplication. But that's not possible unless there was a mistake in the merge.

Alternatively, perhaps the conflict is only on the contentType line, and the @Getter and fieldName are in both branches, leading to a conflict because they are in the same area.

Wait, maybe the actual situation is that both branches added the @Getter and fieldName, but in slightly different positions. For example, the HEAD added the @Getter above fieldName, while the other branch added it elsewhere. But in this case, both have @Getter on fieldName, so perhaps that's not conflicting.

The main conflict here is the contentType declaration: one side initializes it to null, the other doesn't. The @Getter on fieldName is present in both versions. However, in the HEAD's conflict block, the @Getter is included, while in the other branch's conflict block, it's not, but it's present after the conflict marker. Wait, no. The other branch's code in the conflict is only the line private String contentType = null;. The code after the conflict marker is:

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

Which is part of the original code that's not conflicting. So in the other branch's version, after the line private String contentType = null;, the code continues with the @Getter and fieldName, which are the same as in the HEAD's version. Therefore, the conflict is only about the contentType line: whether to initialize it to null or not. The @Getter and fieldName are the same in both branches, so they should not be part of the conflict.

Wait, but according to the conflict markers, the HEAD's version includes the @Getter and fieldName as part of the conflict, while the other branch's version does not. That would suggest that in the other branch, the @Getter and fieldName are not part of the conflicting lines but exist outside. So merging would result in either keeping the HEAD's lines (contentType without initialization, @Getter, fieldName) or the other branch's lines (contentType = null) followed by the existing @Getter and fieldName.

But that would cause duplication of the @Getter and fieldName lines. That's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the conflict is due to both branches modifying the same lines. Let's consider the original code before the merge:

Suppose the original code before any changes was:

  private String contentType;

  private String fieldName;

Then, in the HEAD branch, someone added the @Getter annotation above fieldName, and perhaps removed an initializer from contentType (if it had one). In the other branch, someone added the initializer = null to contentType and also added the @Getter to fieldName. So when merging, both branches modified the lines around contentType and fieldName, leading to a conflict.

In that case, the correct resolution would be to take both changes: set contentType to null (from the other branch) and include the @Getter (from both branches). However, since both branches added the @Getter, there's a duplication. But in the code after the conflict, the @Getter and fieldName are present outside the conflict markers, which might be a mistake.

Wait, looking at the code provided:

The conflict is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
  private String contentType;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;
=======
  private String contentType = null;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

So after resolving the conflict, the code would have:

private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

But then, after that, there's another @Getter and fieldName, leading to duplication. That can't be right. So the user's original code after the conflict has a duplication, which is a problem. Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the contentType line from the other branch (with = null) and keep the @Getter and fieldName once, avoiding duplication.

Therefore, the merged code should be:

  private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

Because both branches agree on having the @Getter and fieldName, but differ on the contentType initialization. So the conflict is only about whether to initialize contentType to null or not. The @Getter and fieldName are added in both branches, but since they're the same, they can be kept once.

In the original conflict, the HEAD's version includes the @Getter and fieldName as part of the conflict, while the other branch's version only changes the contentType line. Therefore, when merging, we should take the contentType = null from the other branch, and keep the @Getter and fieldName from the HEAD, but since they are already present after the conflict, perhaps it's a duplication.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me look at the exact code again.

The code provided by the user is:

<<<<<<< HEAD
  private String contentType;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;
=======
  private String contentType = null;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

So after the conflict markers, there's another @Getter and fieldName. That suggests that in the file being merged, after the conflicting lines, there's another occurrence of @Getter and fieldName. But that's likely a mistake because you can't declare the same field twice. Therefore, the correct resolution is to merge the contentType line and ensure that the @Getter and fieldName are present once.

In this case, the other branch's change is adding = null to contentType, and the HEAD adds the @Getter to fieldName. Both branches have the fieldName declaration. So the merged code should have:

private String contentType = null;

@Getter
private String fieldName;

But in the user's code, after resolving the conflict, there's another @Getter and fieldName, which would cause a duplication. Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the contentType line from the other branch and the @Getter from the HEAD, ensuring that the @Getter and fieldName are only present once.

But how does that fit into the code as presented? The user's code after the conflict has:

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

Which is outside the conflict markers. So perhaps in the base code, those lines were already present, and both branches modified the lines above. Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the contentType line from the other branch (with = null) and remove the duplicate @Getter and fieldName from the HEAD's side.

Therefore, the merged code should be:

  private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

Because the other branch's change is adding = null, and the HEAD's change is adding the @Getter. But if the base code already had the @Getter and fieldName, then the HEAD's addition is redundant. Alternatively, perhaps both branches added the @Getter, leading to a conflict.

This is a bit ambiguous, but based on the code provided, the conflict is between the HEAD's three lines (contentType without init, @Getter, fieldName) and the other branch's one line (contentType = null). Then, after the conflict, the code has another @Getter and fieldName. That would result in duplicate declarations, which is invalid.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the contentType line from the other branch (with = null) and keep the @Getter and fieldName once. Since the HEAD's version includes the @Getter and fieldName inside the conflict, and the other branch's version doesn't, but the code after the conflict has them again, it's likely that the @Getter and fieldName were added by both branches. Hence, the correct merge is to have contentType = null and include the @Getter once.

Therefore, the resolved code should be:

  private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

With the duplicate @Getter and fieldName after the conflict removed. However, in the user's code, the lines after the conflict include another @Getter and fieldName, which would be a mistake. Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the @Getter from the HEAD and the contentType from the other branch, and remove the duplicate lines.

But the user's instruction says to return the entire snippet including full context as provided, modifying only the conflict. So the conflict is between the two versions of contentType and the presence of the @Getter and fieldName in the HEAD's side. The other branch's code has contentType = null and then the @Getter and fieldName are outside the conflict.

Wait, perhaps the actual scenario is that in the other branch, after setting contentType = null, the @Getter and fieldName are already present in the code. So when merging, the conflict is about whether to have the @Getter and fieldName in the same place as the HEAD or not. But this is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the @Getter and fieldName lines are the same in both branches, so they can be merged automatically. The only conflict is the contentType line.

In that case, the correct resolution is to take both changes: set contentType to null (from the other branch) and keep the @Getter (from HEAD), but since both branches have the @Getter and fieldName, they are kept once.

But according to the user's code, after the conflict, there's another @Getter and fieldName, which is likely a mistake. Therefore, the correct resolution is to resolve the conflict by taking the contentType line from the other branch and the @Getter and fieldName from the HEAD, and remove the duplicates.

However, given the user's instruction to preserve the context as provided and only modify the conflict lines, we need to look at how the code is structured.

The original code snippet has:

<<<<<<< HEAD
  private String contentType;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;
=======
  private String contentType = null;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

So after resolving the conflict, the code would have:

private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

Which is invalid because of duplicate field declarations.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to merge the two changes by taking the contentType = null from the other branch and the @Getter from the HEAD, and ensure that the @Getter and fieldName are only present once.

But in the current structure, the code after the conflict includes another @Getter and fieldName, which is a mistake. Therefore, the conflict resolution should remove the duplicate.

But the user's instruction says to preserve the surrounding context as is. Wait, the user says: "make sure you do not modify the context at all and preserve the spacing as is." So the surrounding lines outside the conflict markers should not be changed. However, in this case, the code after the conflict markers includes another @Getter and fieldName, which is part of the context. Therefore, the user is showing that after the conflict, those lines exist. So the full code after the conflict would have:

private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

Which is invalid. Therefore, the correct resolution requires removing the duplicate. But according to the user's instruction, we should not modify the context outside the conflict. So the conflict is between the HEAD's three lines and the other branch's one line. The lines after the conflict (the @Getter and fieldName) are part of the context and must be preserved as is. But that would lead to duplication.

This is a problem. Therefore, perhaps the original code in the other branch does not have the @Getter and fieldName lines after the conflict, but the user's code snippet shows that they do. This suggests that the merge has introduced a duplication because both branches added the same lines.

In this case, the semantic intent is that both branches want to add the @Getter for fieldName. The HEAD branch adds it inline with the contentType declaration, while the other branch may have it elsewhere. But given the code structure, the correct resolution is to keep the @Getter once.

But given the user's instruction to not modify the context and only resolve the conflict, the solution is to take both changes: contentType = null and the @Getter from HEAD, and then the context after (the duplicate @Getter) is preserved. But that's invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps the conflict is only about the contentType line, and the @Getter lines are the same in both branches and can be merged without conflict. However, the way the conflict is presented includes them, so the user needs to decide.

Given the ambiguity, the safest resolution is to take both changes: set contentType to null and include the @Getter from HEAD. However, since the code after the conflict includes another @Getter and fieldName, that's a problem. Therefore, the correct resolution is to remove the duplicate.

But according to the user's instruction, we must not modify the context. So if the context includes the @Getter and fieldName after the conflict, we have to leave them as is. But that would create a duplication.

This is a tricky situation. The user's example may have a mistake in the code snippet. But assuming the code is as presented, the conflict is between the HEAD's three lines and the other branch's one line. The code after the conflict includes the @Getter and fieldName again. Therefore, the merged code should have:

private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

But that's invalid. Therefore, the correct resolution is to realize that the @Getter and fieldName lines are duplicated and should appear only once. Hence, the conflict should be resolved by taking the contentType = null from the other branch and keeping the @Getter and fieldName once, removing the duplication.

However, the user's instruction says to preserve the context as is. If the lines after the conflict are part of the context, then we cannot remove them. Therefore, the conflict resolution must include both the @Getter from the HEAD and the contentType from the other branch, and leave the rest as is, leading to duplication. But that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the @Getter and fieldName lines after the conflict are not part of the conflict and should be retained. In that case, the conflict resolution is to take the contentType line from the other branch (with = null) and discard the @Getter and fieldName from the HEAD, because they are already present after the conflict.

But how to determine that? The user's code snippet shows that after the conflict, there are @Getter and fieldName lines. Therefore, in the other branch's version, those lines are already present. Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the contentType line from the other branch and omit the @Getter and fieldName from the HEAD's version, as they are redundant.

So the merged code would be:

private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

Because the other branch's code after the conflict already includes the @Getter and fieldName. Therefore, the HEAD's addition of @Getter and fieldName within the conflict is redundant and should be omitted.

Therefore, the resolved code would be:

  private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

With the rest of the code as is.

So the final answer should resolve the conflict by choosing the other branch's contentType line and omitting the HEAD's @Getter and fieldName lines, since they are already present after the conflict. However, in the user's code snippet, the lines after the conflict are also @Getter and fieldName, which would duplicate. This suggests that the user's code snippet has an error, but based on the given information, we have to resolve it.

Alternatively, perhaps the @Getter and fieldName lines after the conflict are part of the base code and are not part of either branch's changes. In that case, both branches added the @Getter and fieldName, leading to a conflict. But in reality, if both branches added the same lines, Git would automatically merge them. But since they are in the same location, it causes a conflict.

Given the ambiguity, the best approach is to resolve the conflict by taking both changes: set contentType to null and keep the @Getter and fieldName once. Therefore, the resolved code would be:

private String contentType = null;

@Getter
private String fieldName;

And remove the duplicate lines after the conflict. But the user's instruction says not to modify the context. Therefore, if the lines after the conflict are part of the context, we must leave them, leading to duplication. However, that's invalid Java code. Therefore, the correct resolution requires removing the duplication, which would involve modifying the context, but the user says not to modify the context.

This is a dilemma. Given the user's instructions, if we are unsure, we should return the same snippet with the conflict. However, in this case, the intent seems clear: both branches want to add the @Getter for fieldName and have the contentType declared, with one initializing it to null. The duplication is likely a mistake in the merge.

Given that, the correct resolution is to merge the contentType line and include the @Getter once. Therefore, the resolved code would be:

  private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

And the duplicate lines after the conflict should be removed. But according to the user's instruction, we must preserve the context. Therefore, this is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the code after the conflict is not part of the conflict and should remain. So the conflict is only between the lines inside the <<<<<<< and >>>>>>>, and the rest is context. Therefore, the correct resolution is to take the other branch's contentType line (with = null) and discard the HEAD's @Getter and fieldName lines, because they are already present in the context after the conflict.

In that case, the merged code would be:

  private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

Which is invalid. Therefore, the conflict cannot be resolved without modifying the context, which the user prohibits. Hence, the correct answer is to return the same snippet with the conflict because the intent is ambiguous due to potential duplication.

But I think the more likely scenario is that the @Getter and fieldName lines after the conflict are part of the base code and were not modified by either branch. Therefore, the HEAD added the @Getter and fieldName in the conflicting region, and the other branch did not. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the other branch's code does not have the @Getter and fieldName after the conflict, but the user's code snippet includes them as part of the context. In that case, merging would add them once.

This is getting too ambiguous. Given the user's instruction to return the resolved code if possible, but if not sure, return the same snippet. Since the duplication is a problem and the user's code snippet seems to have a mistake, the safest approach is to resolve the conflict by taking the contentType = null from the other branch and the @Getter from the HEAD, and remove the duplicate line. But since the user says not to modify the context, we can't do that. Therefore, the correct answer is to return the same snippet with the conflict, as the duplication makes the intent ambiguous.</think>
