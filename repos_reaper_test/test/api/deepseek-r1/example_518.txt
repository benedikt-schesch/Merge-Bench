Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the two versions.

In the HEAD version, the ADVANCED group has Example.SPLITSCREEN, Example.BOUNDCAMERA, Example.SCRIPTING. The other branch has SPLITSCREEN, BOUNDCAMERA, and HULLALGORITHM. The comment about AUGMENTEDREALITY is the same in both, just trailing after the comma.

So the conflict is between SCRIPTING and HULLALGORITHM. I need to figure out if these are conflicting changes or if they can be merged. Since they're both adding different examples to the same list, maybe both should be included. But wait, are they mutually exclusive? The original code might have had one, and each branch added a different one. Or perhaps one branch replaced the other.

Looking at the surrounding context, each group is a list of examples. The conflict is in the ADVANCED group. The comment at the end is the same in both, so that's just a comment. The actual change is the third element: SCRIPTING vs HULLALGORITHM.

If both examples are valid and intended to be added, the correct resolution would be to include both. But the way the conflict is presented, it's either one or the other. So maybe one branch added SCRIPTING and the other added HULLALGORITHM. To resolve this, we need to know if both should be present. If the intent is to combine both changes, then the line should have both, separated by commas. However, the user hasn't provided information about whether these are additions or replacements. Since the conflict markers show that in HEAD it's SCRIPTING and in the other branch it's HULLALGORITHM, perhaps the correct resolution is to include both. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe one was a typo fix or a replacement.

Alternatively, maybe the HULLALGORITHM was added in one branch and SCRIPTING in another, and both should be included. In that case, the resolved line would be Example.SPLITSCREEN, Example.BOUNDCAMERA, Example.SCRIPTING, Example.HULLALGORITHM), // ...

But the original code in both sides has three elements. So maybe each branch replaced the third element. For example, perhaps the original had Example.AUGMENTEDREALITY, but one branch changed it to SCRIPTING and another to HULLALGORITHM. Wait, looking at the comment, both sides have // Example.AUGMENTEDREALITY..., which is commented out. So the active code is the three examples before the comment.

So the conflict is between SCRIPTING and HULLALGORITHM. If both are valid and should be included, then the line should have both. But if they are alternatives, then perhaps the user needs to choose. Since the user asked to resolve based on intent and semantics, and if unsure, leave the conflict. But as an expert, I need to infer.

Assuming that both changes are valid and meant to add different examples, the correct resolution is to include both. So the line would be:

Example.SPLITSCREEN, Example.BOUNDCAMERA, Example.SCRIPTING, Example.HULLALGORITHM),

But wait, the original lines in the conflict have only three elements each. HEAD has three, the other branch has three. So combining them would make four. But maybe that's correct. However, without knowing the project's context, it's possible that one was a replacement. Alternatively, maybe one branch added SCRIPTING and another added HULLALGORITHM, both appending to the list. If the original line before the conflict had two elements, and each branch added one, then merging would result in three. But in this case, both branches have three elements. Wait, looking at the code:

HEAD version:
Example.SPLITSCREEN, Example.BOUNDCAMERA, Example.SCRIPTING), // ...comment

Other branch:
Example.SPLITSCREEN, Example.BOUNDCAMERA, Example.HULLALGORITHM), // ...comment

So both sides have three elements. So the conflict is replacing the third element. Therefore, it's a true conflict where each branch modified the same line in a different way. The user must decide which one to keep. Since the user asked to resolve based on intent and semantics, but without more context, it's ambiguous. Therefore, the conflict cannot be automatically resolved, and the merged code should include both options, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps HULLALGORITHM was a correction or a new feature, and SCRIPTING was another. Without knowing, the safe answer is to present the conflict as is. But the user instructed to resolve if possible.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to include both, but since the original code had three, maybe one of them is correct. Alternatively, check if HULLALGORITHM and SCRIPTING can coexist. If they can, then include both. But the user's example groups have varying numbers of examples. For example, the TEXT group has several. So maybe adding both is acceptable. Therefore, the resolved line would be:

Example.SPLITSCREEN, Example.BOUNDCAMERA, Example.SCRIPTING, Example.HULLALGORITHM),

But since both branches are changing the same line, perhaps the correct merge is to take both changes. However, merge tools would mark this as a conflict. Since the user wants semantic resolution, if both examples are valid and intended to be in the ADVANCED group, then include both. But if they are mutually exclusive (e.g., one was a rename), then pick the correct one. Without more info, it's ambiguous, so the conflict remains. However, given the user's instruction to resolve if possible, maybe the correct approach is to include both, adding HULLALGORITHM after SCRIPTING. But I need to check if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the HULLALGORITHM was added in one branch and SCRIPTING in another, and both should be present. In that case, the line would have both. But since the conflict is on the same line, it's a modify-modify conflict. So the user's instruction says to think in terms of intent. If both are valid features, then include both. But without knowing, perhaps the conflict should remain. However, the user is asking to resolve if possible. Since both are in the same part of the code, maybe the correct resolution is to combine them. So the resolved line is:

			Example.SPLITSCREEN, Example.BOUNDCAMERA, Example.SCRIPTING, Example.HULLALGORITHM), // Example.AUGMENTEDREALITY, Example.AUGMENTEDREALITYHORIZON),

But the original lines had three examples each. So combining them would make four. However, maybe that's the right approach. Since the user is a semantic expert, perhaps they can infer that both examples are intended to be included. Therefore, the resolved code includes both.</think>
