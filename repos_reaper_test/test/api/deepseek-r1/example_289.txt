Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The code has a conflict between the HEAD version and another branch. The conflicting parts are around the code that comes after the closing braces of some if statement.

In the HEAD version, there's nothing between the closing braces and the next if statement. The other branch adds some code initializing numInputs, creating a boolean array readOnce, and setting all its elements to false. Then comes the if (isInputAttached()) block where they create DataBag arrays based on numInputs.

Wait, the code after the conflict in both branches is the same: the if (isInputAttached()) block. But in the other branch, they have the numInputs variable declared and initialized before that if statement. In the HEAD version, that variable isn't declared there. So the problem is that the code from the other branch is adding some setup that's necessary for the subsequent code, which uses numInputs. If we just take the HEAD version, which doesn't have that setup, the code would fail because numInputs isn't defined. But the other branch's code adds that setup. So the correct resolution would be to include the code from both branches, but in the right order.

Wait, but the conflict markers show that the HEAD side doesn't have the code, and the other branch adds it. So the merge conflict is because one side added code in that spot and the other didn't. The code after the conflict (the if statement) is present in both, but in the other branch, it's using numInputs which is declared in their added code. Therefore, the code from the other branch is necessary for the subsequent code to work. The HEAD version might have a different implementation, but without the numInputs declaration, the code would have a compile error.

Therefore, to resolve the conflict, we need to include the code from the other branch that declares numInputs and initializes readOnce. Because the code that follows (the if block) uses numInputs, which is declared in the other branch's code. The HEAD version might have removed that code or not included it, but since the other branch adds it, and it's needed for the subsequent code, we should keep it.

So the correct resolution is to take the code from the <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= sides. Wait, the HEAD side is the top part, and the other branch is the bottom part. The conflict is between the code after the closing braces. The HEAD side doesn't have the code, the other branch adds the numInputs and readOnce variables. Then, both sides have the if (isInputAttached()) block. But the code in the if block uses numInputs, which is declared in the other branch's code. Therefore, the other branch's code is necessary here. The HEAD version's code would be missing the declaration of numInputs, leading to an error. Therefore, the correct resolution is to include the code from the other branch (the part between ======= and >>>>>>>), and then the subsequent if block. So the merged code should include the numInputs declaration and the readOnce array, followed by the if statement.

So the resolved code should have the code from the other branch inserted in place of the conflict markers. Therefore, the merged code would be:

                if (bagType != null && bagType.equalsIgnoreCase("default")) {
                    useDefaultBag = true;
                }
            }
        }
        int numInputs = pkgr.getNumInputs(keyWritable.getIndex());
        boolean[] readOnce = new boolean[numInputs];
        for (int i = 0; i < numInputs; i++)
            readOnce[i] = false;

        if (isInputAttached()) {
            // Create numInputs bags
            DataBag[] dbs = null;
            dbs = new DataBag[numInputs];

Because the code after the conflict (the if block) needs numInputs, which is declared in the code added by the other branch, that code is necessary. The HEAD version may have removed that code, but since the other branch adds it and the following code depends on it, we need to keep it. Therefore, the conflict is resolved by taking the code from the other branch and placing it there.</think>

                    useDefaultBag = true;
                }
            }
        }
        int numInputs = pkgr.getNumInputs(keyWritable.getIndex());
        boolean[] readOnce = new boolean[numInputs];
        for (int i = 0; i < numInputs; i++)
            readOnce[i] = false;

        if (isInputAttached()) {
            // Create numInputs bags
            DataBag[] dbs = null;
            dbs = new DataBag[numInputs];
