Okay, I need to resolve this merge conflict in the Java imports. Let's look at the two sides. The HEAD version imports LogManager and Logger from org.apache.logging.log4j, while the other branch imports Logger from org.apache.log4j. These are different logging frameworksâ€”Log4j 2.x vs Log4j 1.x. The classes are not compatible, so just keeping both isn't right. The developer probably switched logging frameworks. Which one should be used?

Looking at the context, the rest of the code might depend on one or the other. If the project moved from Log4j 1.x to 2.x, the HEAD version is correct. The other branch's import is from the older package. Since HEAD is the current branch, maybe that's the intended one. But I need to make sure there's no ambiguity. If both are present, it's a conflict. Since the user didn't provide more code, it's unclear. But the conflict is between two different Logger imports. They can't both be there. So, the correct resolution is to pick the one that's compatible with the rest of the code. Without more info, perhaps HEAD is the right choice. So, remove the conflict markers and keep the HEAD imports. Delete the other import. That would resolve the conflict by choosing Log4j 2.x. But if the user intended to use Log4j 1.x, then it's wrong. But since the conflict is between the two, and the user is asking to resolve based on intent, maybe they upgraded to Log4j 2.x. So the resolved code should have the LogManager and Logger from org.apache.logging.log4j.</think>
