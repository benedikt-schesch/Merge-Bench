Okay, let's tackle this merge conflict. The code snippet has a conflict in the import statements between the HEAD version and the branch 88fb3d4. 

Looking at the HEAD side, they're importing ApiTokenProperty and SecurityListener from jenkins.security. On the other side, the branch is importing BasicApiTokenHelper from the same package. 

I need to figure out if these imports are conflicting or if they can coexist. Both sides are adding different classes from jenkins.security. Since they're different classes, maybe both imports are needed. The user probably added both classes in different contexts, so including both would resolve the conflict without issues.

So the correct approach is to keep both import statements. That means removing the conflict markers and having all three imports: ApiTokenProperty, SecurityListener, and BasicApiTokenHelper. This way, all necessary classes are included, and there's no duplication or overlap. I should make sure the order is maintained as per the original context, but since they're from the same package, the order might not matter. Let me check the original code again. The HEAD has ApiTokenProperty and SecurityListener, while the other branch adds BasicApiTokenHelper. So combining them would have all three imports under the jenkins.security package.

No other changes are needed in the surrounding context. The rest of the code remains the same. There's no ambiguity here because the imports are for different classes, so the merge should include all of them.</think>
