Okay, let me look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java method getPlayerForUser. Both sides are trying to convert the players collection to an array, but they're using different approaches.

In the HEAD version, they're using players.toArray(new Player[players.size()]). This creates an array of the exact size needed. The other side, from commit 5adedd2, is using players.toArray(new Player[0]). I remember that in Java, using a zero-length array can be more efficient because the toArray method can then allocate the right size itself, avoiding a potential array copy. 

Wait, but why the difference here? Maybe one branch was optimizing based on best practices. The zero-length array approach is considered better in modern Java because it's cleaner and might be faster. The size approach might be older code. 

Since both approaches achieve the same result—converting the collection to an array—the intent is the same. The conflict is about the method used. The semantic meaning doesn't change; it's just a matter of which array creation pattern to use. 

The correct resolution would be to pick the more modern, efficient approach. So the version with new Player[0] is better. Therefore, I should resolve the conflict by choosing the second option and remove the conflict markers. The rest of the code remains the same. Let me make sure there's no other changes around, but the loop and return logic are identical. So the resolved line should be final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);.</think>
```java
   * @return The {@code Player} object representing {@code user} in this game, or {@code null} if
   * {@code user} is not in this game.
   */
  @Nullable
  public Player getPlayerForUser(final User user) {
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      if (player.getUser() == user) {
        return player;
      }
    }
