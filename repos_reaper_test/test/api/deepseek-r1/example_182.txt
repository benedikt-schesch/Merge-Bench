Okay, let's look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in the Java imports. The HEAD version is importing `org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType` while the other side is importing `org.apache.pig.ExecType`. 

I remember that in Apache Pig, the `ExecType` class might have moved. Let me check. Oh right, in older versions, `ExecType` was an inner class of `PigServer`, so the import would be `org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType`. But in newer versions, it was moved to be a top-level class in `org.apache.pig`, so the correct import is `org.apache.pig.ExecType`. 

So the conflict arises because one branch is using the old structure and the other the new. The correct import depends on the Pig version being used. If both branches are updating to the new version, we should use the top-level import. Alternatively, if one branch is using an older version, there might be a problem.

But since the conflict shows that one side changed from PigServer.ExecType to ExecType, it's likely that the correct resolution is to use the top-level import. So we should pick the version from the incoming change (the one in the branch being merged), replacing the HEAD version. That way, both changes are resolved by using the correct, updated import statement.</think>
```java
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.apache.log4j.Level;
import org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender;
import org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout;
import org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator;
import org.apache.pig.ExecType;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.HExecutionEngine;
import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;
import org.apache.pig.impl.io.FileLocalizer;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.LogicalPlanBuilder;
import org.apache.pig.impl.util.JarManager;
```

The conflict resolution chooses `org.apache.pig.ExecType` because this appears to reflect a package reorganization where:
1. The incoming change (1488b22) shows the modern import path
2. Apache Pig versions after 0.7 moved ExecType to be a top-level class
3. Both sides are trying to import the same logical class, just from different package locations
4. The remaining imports all relate to Pig's internal implementation details that would align with the newer package structure
