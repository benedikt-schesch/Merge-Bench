Okay, let's see. The user wants me to resolve a merge conflict in this Java code. The conflict is between the HEAD version and the other branch (47d0018...). 

Looking at the conflicting parts:

HEAD side has:
- assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
- A String expectedMessage that combines "403", the method, and the URL.
- Asserts that the message equals expectedMessage.

The other branch has:
- assertNull(ge.getDetails());
- Asserts that the message starts with "403".

First, I need to understand what each side is trying to do. The HEAD is checking the full message, including the method and URL. The other branch is checking if the message starts with 403 and uses 'ge' instead of 'responseException'. Wait, but in the code above, the variable is named responseException. So the other branch uses 'ge', which might be a typo or a different variable name. That's a problem because 'ge' isn't declared here. The correct variable is responseException. So the other branch's code has a mistakeâ€”using 'ge' instead of 'responseException'. 

So, the line assertNull(ge.getDetails()); is incorrect because 'ge' isn't defined. The correct variable is responseException. Therefore, the other branch's code is wrong here. However, maybe 'ge' is a typo and should be responseException. If that's the case, then perhaps the intent is to check that getDetails() is null and the message starts with 403. 

The HEAD's code checks the exact message, including the method and URL, while the other branch just checks the start. Maybe the other branch's change is to make the test less brittle, not depending on the full message, just the status code. But the variable name is wrong. 

So, to resolve this, we need to correct the variable name in the other branch's code. Then, decide whether to check the exact message or just the start. 

Looking at the surrounding code: the test is about creating a GoogleJsonResponseException from a response. The HEAD's expectedMessage includes "GET" and the URL, which might be part of the exception's message. The other branch's change simplifies the check to just the status code. 

If both changes are valid but conflicting, we need to combine them. However, since the variable name in the other branch is incorrect, we should fix that. Then, perhaps keep both assertions: check that the message starts with 403 and also includes the method and URL. But wait, the HEAD's expectedMessage is "403\nGET ...", so the message starts with "403" followed by a newline. The other branch's assertTrue checks if the message starts with "403". 

So maybe the correct resolution is to keep the assertNull for getDetails(), check that the message starts with "403", and also check the rest of the message if possible. However, the two branches have different approaches. Alternatively, the other branch's change might be an improvement by making the test less fragile, not checking the entire message. 

But since the variable name in the other branch is wrong, that's a mistake. So the correct code should use responseException, not ge. Therefore, the other branch's code should have assertNull(responseException.getDetails()); and assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));. 

But in the conflict, the HEAD has assertNull(responseException.getDetails()); and checks the full message, while the other branch has assertNull(ge.getDetails()); and checks startsWith. 

So the resolution would be to take the corrected version of the other branch's assertions but using the correct variable name. However, the user might have intended to check the full message in HEAD and just the status code in the other branch. 

Alternatively, maybe the two tests can coexist. But looking at the code, they are both asserting on the same exception. So perhaps the intended resolution is to check that getDetails() is null, the message starts with 403, and also includes the rest of the message as in HEAD. But that's conflicting. 

Wait, the HEAD's expectedMessage is "403\nGET " + URL. So the message starts with "403\n". The other branch's check is message.startsWith("403"), which would be true because "403\n" starts with "403". So maybe the other branch's check is redundant if we have the exact message check. However, if the other branch is trying to make the test less strict on the message, only checking the status code part, then perhaps we should combine both: check that the message starts with "403" and also check the details are null. 

But in the conflict, the two branches are modifying the same lines. So the correct resolution would be to take both changes but correct the variable name. 

Wait, the conflict is between:

HEAD:
assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
String expectedMessage = "403\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());

Other branch:
assertNull(ge.getDetails());
assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

So the variable name in the other branch is 'ge', which is incorrect. So that line is wrong. Therefore, the correct code would be to use responseException, and perhaps combine both checks. But since they are conflicting, maybe the intended resolution is to take the HEAD's exact message check and the other branch's startsWith, but that's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the other branch's code is wrong because of the variable name, so we should discard it and keep the HEAD's version. 

But the user asked to resolve the conflict by considering the intent. If the other branch intended to check that the message starts with 403 (maybe to make the test less brittle), but mistakenly used 'ge', then the correct code would be to correct that to responseException and keep the startsWith check. However, the HEAD's code checks the exact message. 

Which one is better? The HEAD's test is more precise, ensuring the entire message is correct. The other branch's test is more lenient, only checking the status code part. If both are valid, perhaps we should keep both assertions. But that's not possible here because they are modifying the same lines. 

Alternatively, maybe the other branch's change is meant to replace the exact message check with a startsWith, perhaps because the exact message might vary in different contexts, and they only care about the status code. 

In that case, the correct resolution would be to keep the assertNull(responseException.getDetails()); from HEAD (since the other branch's line has a typo) and take the assertTrue from the other branch, but correct 'ge' to 'responseException'. 

So the resolved code would be:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

But the HEAD also has the exact message check. So we need to decide which one to keep. If the intent of the other branch is to relax the message check, then we should replace the assertEquals with the assertTrue. However, if the exact message is important, we should keep the HEAD's version. 

Alternatively, maybe the other branch's code is a fix for a test that was too strict, and the exact message isn't important, just the status code. 

In the absence of more context, perhaps the correct resolution is to take the other branch's startsWith check but correct the variable name, and drop the exact message check. So:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

But the user's example shows that the original code in HEAD had the exact message, and the other branch is changing it to startsWith. So resolving the conflict would require choosing between the two. 

Alternatively, maybe the two changes can be merged by keeping both assertions. But that would require adding both lines. However, in the conflict, the two versions are on the same lines. 

Wait, the conflict is between:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "403\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
=======
    assertNull(ge.getDetails());
    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("403"));
>>>>>>> 47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613

So the lines are replacing the three lines (two asserts and a variable) with two lines. To resolve, we need to decide which assertions to keep. 

But given that the other branch has a typo (ge instead of responseException), but the intent is to check that getDetails() is null and the message starts with 403, the correct resolution would be to correct the variable name and keep both assertions. 

Wait, but the other branch's code has:

assertNull(ge.getDetails());
assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

But 'ge' is not defined. The correct variable is responseException. So fixing that, the code becomes:

assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

But the HEAD's code has:

assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
String expectedMessage = "403\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());

So the conflict is between checking the exact message vs. checking it starts with 403. 

If we can preserve both intents, perhaps check that the message starts with 403 and also contains the method and URL. But the HEAD's expectedMessage includes a newline after 403. 

Alternatively, the other branch's change might be a fix because the exact message changed, and the test was failing. So they relaxed the check to just the status code. 

Without more context, it's hard to tell. But since the user is asking to resolve the conflict considering the semantics, I need to see if both changes can be compatible. 

The other branch's code (after fixing the variable name) is checking that the message starts with 403. The HEAD's code is checking the entire message. These are conflicting unless we combine them. 

But how? For example, check that the message starts with 403 and also contains the method and URL. But the HEAD's expected message is "403\nGET ...", so the startsWith "403" is true. 

So perhaps the other branch's intent is to check the status code part, while the HEAD's intent is to check the entire message. But these are conflicting changes. 

In a merge conflict, if both changes modify the same lines, you have to choose one or the other or find a way to combine them. 

If the other branch is correct in relaxing the check, then we should take their change but fix the variable name. Otherwise, keep the HEAD's change. 

Alternatively, maybe the other branch's code is a mistake, given the variable name error. Since the variable name is incorrect, perhaps the HEAD's code is correct, and the other branch's code is erroneous. Therefore, the conflict should be resolved by keeping the HEAD's version. 

But the user said to think in terms of intent. The other branch's intent is to check that getDetails() is null and the message starts with 403. The HEAD's intent is to check the entire message. If the message in the exception is expected to have the exact format, then the HEAD's version is better. If the exact message isn't important and just the status code is, then the other branch's version is better. 

Without knowing which is correct, but considering that the other branch's code has a typo (ge), which is incorrect, the correct resolution is to keep the HEAD's code. But if the typo is a mistake and the intended code is to check startsWith, then we should correct the variable name and use the other branch's assertion. 

But the user might have intended to correct the test to check for the status code prefix. 

In conclusion, the best approach is to correct the variable name in the other branch's code and keep their assertion, replacing the exact message check. So the resolved code would be:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, check the line endings and syntax. 

So the resolved code snippet would be:

    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));
  }

  public void testFrom_detailsArbitraryJsonContent() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport("{\"foo\":\"bar\"}", Json.MEDIA_TYPE);
    HttpRequest request =

But wait, the original conflict ends with the line from the other branch. So the merge would remove the HEAD's lines and take the other branch's lines, but corrected. 

So in the merged code, the conflict markers are removed, and the correct lines are kept. 

Therefore, the final code after resolution would have:

    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

But the user's example shows that the other branch's code uses 'ge', which is wrong. So correcting that to 'responseException' is necessary. 

Thus, the resolved code should be as above, with the variable name fixed.</think>

        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);

        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));
  }
