Okay, let's take a look at this merge conflict. The conflict is in a JavaDoc comment for a constructor of a DeleteRequest class. The HEAD version has the parameters table, key, and family documented, but the other branch (2d0abace41a98eccdcd180deee15181c7238898d) adds a @since tag indicating version 1.1.

The goal here is to resolve the conflict by combining both changes. The @since tag is probably added to indicate when this constructor was introduced, which is useful information. The HEAD version doesn't have it, so the merge should include that addition.

Looking at the code structure, the conflict markers are around the @since line. The correct resolution would be to keep the @since tag from the incoming branch while preserving the rest of the parameters. Since the parameters in both versions are the same (table, key, family), there's no conflict there. The only difference is the addition of the @since tag.

So, the resolved JavaDoc should have all the existing parameters and include the @since 1.1 from the other branch. The constructor's code itself doesn't have any conflicting changes beyond the comment, so the method definition remains as is.

I need to make sure that the merged code includes the @since tag without any other modifications. The spacing and order of the parameters in the constructor don't change, so the final code after resolving should have the @since line added after the @param family line.</think>

   * <strong>These byte arrays will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @param table The table to edit.
   * @param key The key of the row to edit in that table.
   * @param family The column family to edit in that table.
   * @since 1.1

  public DeleteRequest(final byte[] table,
                       final byte[] key,
                       final byte[] family) {
