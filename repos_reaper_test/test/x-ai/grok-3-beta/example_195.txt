Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context, in markdown code syntax. I have not modified the context or spacing in any way. Following the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the conflict and propose a resolution.

```java
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }
    
    
    public Class getClassForAlias(String alias) throws IOException{
<<<<<<< HEAD
        String className, funcSpec = null;
=======
        String className = null;
        FuncSpec funcSpec = null;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        if (definedFunctions != null) {
            funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias);
        }
        if (funcSpec != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

Let's break down the merge conflict to understand the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (First Side):**
  - Declares two variables, `className` and `funcSpec`, in a single line using `String className, funcSpec = null;`.
  - The type of `funcSpec` is inferred to be `String` due to the combined declaration.
  - This suggests the intent is to treat `funcSpec` as a `String` (likely a string representation of a function specification) and initialize it to `null`.
  - The simplicity of this declaration might indicate that `funcSpec` doesn't require a more specific type or complex structure at this point in the codebase's evolution on this branch.

- **1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309 (Second Side):**
  - Declares the two variables separately: `String className = null;` and `FuncSpec funcSpec = null;`.
  - Notably, `funcSpec` is typed as `FuncSpec`, which is likely a custom class or interface representing a function specification more explicitly than a simple `String`.
  - This suggests the intent on this branch is to use a more structured or type-safe representation of a function specification, possibly indicating a refactoring or enhancement where `FuncSpec` was introduced or is being utilized.

- **Common Intent:**
  - Both sides agree on the existence of two variables: `className` (as a `String`) and `funcSpec` (though differing in type).
  - Both sides initialize the variables to `null`.
  - The subsequent code (outside the conflict) shows that `funcSpec` is assigned a value from `definedFunctions.get(alias)`, implying that `definedFunctions` is likely a map or collection. The key semantic question is the expected type of the value returned by `definedFunctions.get()`.

- **Conflict Resolution Challenge:**
  - The primary difference is the type of `funcSpec`: `String` in HEAD versus `FuncSpec` in the other branch.
  - If `definedFunctions` is a map that returns `FuncSpec` objects, then the second side (using `FuncSpec funcSpec = null;`) is likely the intended or more accurate type.
  - If `definedFunctions` returns a `String`, then HEADâ€™s approach might be correct in the context of that branch.
  - Without additional context about the type of `definedFunctions` or the broader codebase, there is ambiguity. However, the use of a custom type `FuncSpec` suggests a deliberate design choice, likely indicating that the codebase has evolved to use a dedicated type for function specifications rather than raw strings.

### Proposed Resolution

Given the semantics and intent, I propose resolving the conflict by adopting the type `FuncSpec` for `funcSpec`, as it likely represents a more structured or modern approach in the codebase. The declaration of `className` as a separate variable initialized to `null` also aligns with better readability and clarity. Therefore, the resolved code within the conflict markers would favor the second side (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`).

However, since the instruction specifies to return the snippet unchanged if the intent is ambiguous or resolution is uncertain, and to preserve the original context, I am returning the snippet as provided above without resolving the conflict in the code block. My analysis and proposed resolution are included here as commentary.

If you have additional context about the type of `definedFunctions` or the purpose of `FuncSpec`, I can refine the resolution further. For now, the original conflicted snippet is preserved as requested.
