Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as I will analyze the intent and semantics of both sides before proposing a resolution. The context and spacing are unchanged, presented in markdown code syntax as requested.

```java
        mResponse = null;
        return is;
    }

    public String asString() throws ResponseException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    	if (TwitterApplication.DEBUG){
    		DebugTimer.betweenStart("AS STRING");
    	}
>>>>>>> cbb20c83a4abae0550321f56101bb216b5c8f5bb

        String str = null;
        InputStream is = asStream();
        if (null == is) {
            return str;
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics:
- **HEAD (left side)**: The HEAD version does not include any additional code or logic in the `asString()` method at the point of conflict. It appears to represent the original or baseline state of the code without modifications in this section.
- **cbb20c83a4abae0550321f56101bb216b5c8f5bb (right side)**: The incoming change adds a debug logging mechanism using `TwitterApplication.DEBUG` and `DebugTimer.betweenStart("AS STRING")`. The intent here is to introduce debugging or timing functionality to measure performance or log events when the `asString()` method is called, but only if debugging is enabled.

### Resolution Rationale:
The intent of the right side (`cbb20c83a4...`) is clear: it aims to add conditional debugging logic to the `asString()` method. The HEAD side does not introduce conflicting logic or modifications in this area; it simply lacks the additional debugging code. Since there is no semantic conflict (i.e., no competing or contradictory changes), the resolution should incorporate the debugging logic from the right side, as it represents an enhancement without negating any existing functionality.

### Resolved Code Snippet:
```java
        mResponse = null;
        return is;
    }

    public String asString() throws ResponseException {
    	if (TwitterApplication.DEBUG){
    		DebugTimer.betweenStart("AS STRING");
    	}

        String str = null;
        InputStream is = asStream();
        if (null == is) {
            return str;
```

This resolution adopts the debugging addition from the right side while maintaining the integrity of the surrounding context. If there are any concerns or if the intent of the debugging code is not as assumed, please provide further context or clarification.
