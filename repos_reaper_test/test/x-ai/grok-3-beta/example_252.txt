Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict but, due to ambiguity in the intent, I am returning the snippet unchanged.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.io.SequenceInputStream;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.SocketException;
import java.net.SocketImplFactory;
import java.net.URL;
=======
>>>>>>> 1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Enumeration;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Iterator;
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics:
- **HEAD Side**: The `HEAD` side includes imports related to networking functionality (`java.net.Socket`, `java.net.SocketException`, `java.net.SocketImplFactory`, `java.net.URL`). This suggests that the code in this branch likely deals with network operations or connectivity.
- **Incoming Side (1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81)**: The incoming side removes these networking imports entirely, which might indicate that the networking functionality is no longer needed or has been refactored out in this branch. However, there are no additional imports or context provided to suggest an alternative focus.
- **Ambiguity**: Without further context about the purpose of the code or the changes in the incoming branch, it is unclear whether the removal of the networking imports is intentional (e.g., due to refactoring or feature removal) or accidental. Additionally, there is no way to confirm if the `HEAD` side's imports are still required for the overall functionality of the code.

### Conclusion:
Due to the lack of sufficient context to determine the intent of the merge (e.g., whether networking functionality is still relevant or has been intentionally removed), I am unable to resolve the conflict. The snippet is returned as is with the conflict markers intact. If additional context or clarification about the purpose of the changes on either side is provided, I can revisit the resolution.
