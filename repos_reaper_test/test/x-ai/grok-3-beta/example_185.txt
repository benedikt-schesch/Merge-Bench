Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, since the intent of both sides of the merge is ambiguous without additional context about what changes were intended in the conflicting lines. I've enclosed it in markdown code syntax as requested and preserved all spacing and context.

```java
                                paramFiles.size() > 0 ? paramFiles.toArray(type2) : null);
        return new BufferedReader(new StringReader(writer.toString()));
    }
}
    
<<<<<<< HEAD

private static String getVersionString() {
	String findContainingJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(Main.class);
	  try { 
		  StringBuffer buffer = new  StringBuffer();
          JarFile jar = new JarFile(findContainingJar); 
```

### Explanation:
- **Intent Analysis**: The merge conflict appears to be between two branches, `HEAD` and the commit `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`. However, the conflicting section itself is empty on the `HEAD` side, and no content is provided on the other side within the snippet. Without additional context or content in the conflicting region, it is unclear what changes or features each side of the merge is trying to introduce or preserve.
- **Ambiguity**: Since the conflict markers do not show any specific code changes (e.g., differing implementations or additional logic), I cannot deduce the semantic intent of either side. Resolving the conflict without understanding the purpose of the changes risks introducing errors or omitting critical functionality.
- **Decision**: As per the instruction, when the intent is ambiguous or unclear, the snippet is returned with the conflict markers intact for further manual resolution by someone with access to the full repository or additional context about the changes.

If you can provide more details about the conflicting changes or the surrounding commits, I would be happy to assist in resolving the conflict based on the intended semantics.
