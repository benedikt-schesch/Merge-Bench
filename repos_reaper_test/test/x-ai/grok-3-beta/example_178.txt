Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and spacing. Following the snippet, I will explain my analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict and provide a resolution.

```java

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.util.Map;

import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.VisitorException;
import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.PlanException;
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
The merge conflict arises in the import statements of a Java file. Let's analyze the intent behind both sides of the merge:

- **HEAD (Left Side)**:
  - Adds imports for `java.io.OutputStream` and `java.io.PrintStream` in addition to `java.util.Map`.
  - The presence of `OutputStream` and `PrintStream` suggests that the code in this branch likely deals with output operations, such as writing to a stream or printing data. These imports indicate a specific functionality related to I/O operations.

- **1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309 (Right Side)**:
  - Imports `java.util.Map` and `java.util.Collection`.
  - The inclusion of `Collection` suggests that the code in this branch might be working with collections of data, potentially for iteration or manipulation of multiple elements. This implies a focus on data structures for storing or processing groups of items.

- **Common Ground**:
  - Both sides include `java.util.Map`, indicating that this import is necessary for the functionality in both branches.
  - The conflict primarily revolves around whether to include `OutputStream` and `PrintStream` (HEAD) or `Collection` (Right Side).

- **Ambiguity**:
  - Without the full context of the code (i.e., how these imports are used in the class), it is not entirely clear whether both sets of imports are needed or if one side's imports are irrelevant.
  - However, in Java, unused imports do not cause runtime issues, and modern IDEs or build tools often remove them if unnecessary. Therefore, including all imports from both sides is a safe approach unless there are specific constraints (e.g., avoiding bloat or namespace conflicts, which are unlikely here).

### Resolution
Based on the semantic analysis, the intent of both branches can likely be preserved by including all the unique imports from both sides. This ensures that any functionality introduced in either branch (I/O operations from HEAD or collection handling from the right side) is supported by the necessary imports. Therefore, the resolved snippet combines the imports as follows:

```java
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Collection;

import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.OperatorPlan;
import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.VisitorException;
import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.PlanException;
```

### Explanation of Resolution
- I have included `java.io.OutputStream` and `java.io.PrintStream` from the HEAD branch to support potential I/O operations.
- I have included `java.util.Collection` from the right side to support functionality related to collections.
- `java.util.Map` is retained as it is common to both sides.
- This resolution assumes that both sets of functionality (I/O and collections) might be required in the merged code. If, upon further review of the full code, any of these imports are unused, they can be removed during cleanup. However, at this stage, combining them preserves the intent of both branches without loss of functionality.

If you have additional context or specific requirements (e.g., avoiding unused imports), please provide them, and I can adjust the resolution accordingly.
