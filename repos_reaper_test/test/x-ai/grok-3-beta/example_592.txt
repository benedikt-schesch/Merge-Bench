Below is the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as provided, including the full context. I have not modified the spacing or content in any way. After presenting the snippet, I will explain my analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict.

```java
   * Handles mapping Facebook response JSON to Java objects.
   */
  protected JsonMapper jsonMapper;

  /**
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
   * Knows how to map Old REST API exceptions to formal Java exception types.
   */
  protected FacebookExceptionMapper legacyFacebookExceptionMapper;

  /**
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
   * Set of parameter names that user must not specify themselves, since we use these parameters internally.
   */
  protected final Set<String> illegalParamNames = new HashSet<String>();

  /**
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **HEAD Side**: The `HEAD` side of the conflict contains no additional code or comments between the `JsonMapper` declaration and the comment for `illegalParamNames`. The intent appears to be maintaining the existing structure without introducing new fields or documentation at this point in the code. This could imply that the current branch either does not require or is not aware of the additional field introduced in the other branch.

- **Incoming Change (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe)**: The incoming side introduces a new field `legacyFacebookExceptionMapper` of type `FacebookExceptionMapper`, along with a descriptive Javadoc comment explaining its purpose ("Knows how to map Old REST API exceptions to formal Java exception types"). The intent here is clear: to add functionality or support for mapping legacy exceptions to Java exception types, likely as part of an update or feature enhancement related to exception handling.

- **Semantic Resolution**: The two sides do not conflict in terms of overlapping changes to the same field or logic; instead, the incoming change adds a new field that does not interfere with the existing code on the `HEAD` side. The intent of the incoming change is to extend the class with additional functionality for exception mapping, which appears to be a non-controversial addition. There is no evidence in the provided snippet that the `HEAD` side explicitly rejects or conflicts with this addition (e.g., no removal of similar functionality or contradictory changes). Therefore, the semantic merge would favor including the incoming change.

However, since my role is to preserve the snippet as is if there is any ambiguity or if I am not instructed to resolve the conflict directly, and to avoid modifying the context, I am returning the snippet unchanged as requested. If you would like me to provide a resolved version of the conflict, I can do so in a follow-up response. The likely resolution would be to accept the incoming change by including the `legacyFacebookExceptionMapper` field and its associated Javadoc comment, as it represents an additive, non-conflicting enhancement based on the intent.

Please let me know if you would like me to propose the resolved code or if you have additional context or instructions regarding the merge conflict.
