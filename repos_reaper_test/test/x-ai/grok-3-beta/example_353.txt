I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet with the conflict as is, since the intent and resolution might require further clarification. My goal is to preserve the original context and spacing exactly as provided.

```java
        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "403\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
=======
    assertNull(ge.getDetails());
    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("403"));
>>>>>>> 47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613
  }

  public void testFrom_errorEmptyContentButWithJsonContentType() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport(null, Json.MEDIA_TYPE);
      HttpRequest request =
```

**Analysis of Intent and Semantics:**

- **HEAD branch**: The intent appears to be a precise check of the exception message, expecting it to be exactly `"403\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL`. It uses `responseException` as the variable name and asserts that the details are `null`.
- **47d00185 branch**: The intent seems to be a more general check, verifying only that the exception message starts with `"403"`. However, it uses `ge` as the variable name, which is inconsistent with the surrounding code where the variable is `responseException`. This might indicate a typo or an incomplete rename.
- **Conflict Issue**: The primary issue is the variable naming mismatch (`responseException` vs. `ge`) and the differing assertions on the message content (`assertEquals` for an exact match vs. `assertTrue` with `startsWith` for a partial match).
- **Ambiguity**: It's unclear whether the exact message match or the partial match is the desired behavior without additional context about the test's purpose. Additionally, the variable naming discrepancy (`ge` vs. `responseException`) suggests a potential error in the `47d00185` branch.

Due to this ambiguity in intent and the potential typo in variable naming, I have chosen not to resolve the conflict and have returned the snippet with the conflict markers intact. If you can provide additional context or clarify the desired behavior (e.g., whether an exact or partial message match is needed, or confirm the correct variable name), I can assist in resolving the conflict.
