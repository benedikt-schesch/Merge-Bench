Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including spacing and context. I will also explain my thought process regarding the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge before deciding on a resolution.

```java
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private int mFaceIDCounter;
	private final SparseArray<Sprite> mFaces = new SparseArray<Sprite>();


```

### Thought Process on Merge Conflict Resolution

**Context Analysis:**
- The code snippet appears to be part of a class (likely in a game development context, possibly using a library like AndEngine, given the presence of `Camera`, `TextureRegion`, and `Sprite`).
- The fields include a `Camera` object, a texture-related field (which is the source of the conflict), a `TextureRegion`, a counter for face IDs, and a `SparseArray` to store `Sprite` objects.
- The conflict is between `BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture` on the `HEAD` branch and `BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas` on the branch with commit ID `91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d`.

**Semantic Intent Analysis:**
- **HEAD Branch (`BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture`):** This likely represents an older or simpler approach where a single bitmap texture is used. The intent might be to load and manage a single texture for rendering purposes.
- **Other Branch (`BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas`):** This suggests an optimization or update, as `BitmapTextureAtlas` typically refers to a collection of textures combined into a single atlas for more efficient rendering (common in game engines to reduce draw calls). The intent here seems to be improving performance by using a texture atlas instead of individual textures.
- **Surrounding Context:** The presence of `TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion` right after the conflicted field suggests that the texture (or atlas) is likely used to define regions for rendering sprites (faces in this case). `BitmapTextureAtlas` aligns better with `TextureRegion`, as atlases often store multiple regions, whereas a plain `BitmapTexture` might represent a single texture without sub-regions.

**Resolution Decision:**
- Given the context and the use of `TextureRegion`, the intent of the branch with `BitmapTextureAtlas` seems more aligned with modern game development practices and the surrounding code's needs (managing multiple faces/sprites efficiently).
- However, since I cannot be entirely sure of the broader codebase or whether `BitmapTexture` is explicitly required for a specific use case in the `HEAD` branch, I will err on the side of caution. Without additional context or confirmation, I will not modify the code and will return it with the conflict intact as requested.

**Conclusion:**
Since the intent could be interpreted in favor of `BitmapTextureAtlas` due to its alignment with `TextureRegion`, but there is still ambiguity without further context about the rest of the codebase, I will preserve the snippet as is with the merge conflict markers. If additional information is provided (e.g., how these fields are used elsewhere), I can revisit the resolution.

The snippet remains unchanged as provided above with the conflict markers intact.
