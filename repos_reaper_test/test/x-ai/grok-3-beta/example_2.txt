Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict, but due to the ambiguity in the intent of the imports being added or removed, I am returning the snippet unchanged for further manual resolution or clarification.

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.net.Socket;
import java.util.Calendar;
=======
>>>>>>> 9fb814003b7bf530373d9ea1d7a80056f92692d1
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Timer;
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics:
- **HEAD Side**: Includes imports for `java.net.Socket` and `java.util.Calendar`. This suggests that the code on this branch likely uses network socket functionality and date/time operations.
- **Incoming Side (9fb814003b7bf530373d9ea1d7a80056f92692d1)**: Removes these two imports, which might indicate that the code no longer requires these dependencies or they were deemed unnecessary in this branch.
- **Ambiguity**: Without further context on whether these imports are still needed in the codebase (i.e., whether `Socket` and `Calendar` are used elsewhere in the file or project), it is unclear whether they should be retained or removed. Removing them could break functionality if they are still in use, while keeping them unnecessarily bloats the import list if they are no longer needed.

Due to this ambiguity, I have chosen not to resolve the conflict and instead preserve the original conflict markers for manual review or additional context from the developers involved in the merge. If further code or intent is provided, I can assist in resolving this conflict.
