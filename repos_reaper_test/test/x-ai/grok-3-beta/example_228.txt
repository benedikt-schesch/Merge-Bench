Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as it was given, including spacing and context. I will then analyze the conflict and provide a resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

```java
    private PigServer pig;
    
    @Before
    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        pig = new PigServer(MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
=======
        pig = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }

    @Test
    public void testBigGroupAll() throws Throwable {
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Conflict Analysis:**
- **HEAD side:** Uses `MAPREDUCE` as the first argument to the `PigServer` constructor. This likely represents a constant or variable referring to a specific execution mode for PigServer (e.g., MapReduce mode). The intent appears to be initializing the `PigServer` with a MapReduce execution context.
- **Incoming change (1488b22):** Uses `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` as the first argument. This seems to be an enum or a more explicit reference to the execution type for PigServer, likely from a newer or refactored version of the codebase where the API or naming convention has changed. The intent is also to initialize the `PigServer` with a MapReduce execution context, but using a more structured or updated reference.
- **Semantic Intent:** Both sides are trying to achieve the same functional goalâ€”initializing a `PigServer` instance to operate in MapReduce mode. The difference lies in the syntax or API used to reference the MapReduce execution type, indicating a possible refactoring or version update in the codebase.

**Resolution Decision:**
Since both sides have the same intent (using MapReduce mode for `PigServer`), the resolution should favor the more explicit or updated API if possible. The incoming change (`ExecType.MAPREDUCE`) appears to be a more formal or type-safe way of specifying the execution type (likely an enum), which suggests it comes from a newer or refactored version of the codebase. Unless there is a specific reason to retain the older `MAPREDUCE` reference (e.g., compatibility with an older library version), adopting the incoming change is likely the better choice as it aligns with modern naming conventions or API updates. However, to confirm this, one would ideally check the surrounding codebase or documentation for the correct API. Since the intent is unambiguous and the incoming change seems more structured, I will resolve the conflict by adopting the incoming change.

**Resolved Code Snippet:**

```java
    private PigServer pig;
    
    @Before
    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
        pig = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
    }

    @Test
    public void testBigGroupAll() throws Throwable {
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

**Note:** The second conflict marker in the `@Test` section remains unresolved as it appears incomplete in the provided snippet (no closing `=======` or closing Git marker for that conflict). If further context or the rest of the conflict is provided, I can assist with resolving that as well. For now, it is preserved as is.
