I'll preserve the context exactly as provided and analyze the intent of both sides of the merge conflict to resolve it semantically. My goal is to understand what each side is trying to achieve and propose a resolution that combines their intents if possible.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict markers, preserved exactly as is:

```java
        .getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, BroadcastConnectsAndDisconnects.class));
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
    builder.append(String.format("cah.COOKIE_DOMAIN = '%s';\n", cookieDomain));
    boolean globalChatEnabled = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, GlobalChatEnabled.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED = %b;\n", globalChatEnabled));
<<<<<<< HEAD
    boolean insecureIdAllowed = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, InsecureIdAllowed.class));
=======
    builder.append(String.format("cah.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED = %b;\n", gameChatEnabled));
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
    builder.append(String.format("cah.INSECURE_ID_ALLOWED = %b;\n", insecureIdAllowed));
    boolean broadcastingUsers = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, BroadcastConnectsAndDisconnects.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.BROADCASTING_USERS = %b;\n", broadcastingUsers));

<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict
- **Context Overview**: This code appears to be generating JavaScript configuration strings using a `StringBuilder` (`builder`). The configuration variables are for a web application, likely related to a game or chat system, with settings for cookie domains, chat features, security, and user broadcasting.
- **First Conflict (top section)**:
  - The line with `>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967` seems to be a dangling conflict marker without a corresponding `<<<<<<<` in the provided snippet. It looks like it might pertain to a line above the provided context, possibly related to initializing a boolean variable or injector call for `BroadcastConnectsAndDisconnects`. Since it's incomplete in the snippet, I’ll leave it as is.
- **Second Conflict (middle section)**:
  - **HEAD side**: Declares and initializes a boolean variable `insecureIdAllowed` using an injector to fetch a configuration value for `InsecureIdAllowed`.
  - **Branch side (ed08e371)**: Appends a configuration string for `GAME_CHAT_ENABLED` using a variable `gameChatEnabled` (which isn’t defined in the provided snippet, suggesting it might be defined elsewhere or missing).
  - **Intent**: 
    - HEAD seems to prioritize setting up the `insecureIdAllowed` variable, which is later used in the `builder.append` call for `INSECURE_ID_ALLOWED`.
    - The branch side introduces a new configuration for game chat (`GAME_CHAT_ENABLED`), which does not conflict semantically with `INSECURE_ID_ALLOWED` but is placed in the same location, suggesting a missing line or different ordering.
    - These two intents are not mutually exclusive; they can coexist as separate configuration settings.
- **Third Conflict (bottom section)**:
  - Appears to be an incomplete conflict marker (`<<<<<<< HEAD`) with no corresponding `>>>>>>>` or content in the snippet. Likely a formatting or copy-paste issue in the provided code. It doesn’t affect the content directly, so I’ll leave it as is.

### Resolution Reasoning
- For the first conflict, since it’s incomplete (`>>>>>>>` without `<<<<<<<`), I cannot resolve it without the full context. It might be related to the declaration of `broadcastingUsers` or something above, so I’ll leave it unchanged.
- For the second conflict, the intents are clear: HEAD wants to initialize `insecureIdAllowed`, and the branch wants to append a `GAME_CHAT_ENABLED` setting. These can be combined by including both lines. However, there’s a potential issue: the `gameChatEnabled` variable is not defined in the snippet. It’s possible it’s defined elsewhere, or it was omitted. I’ll include it in the resolution but note that it might need verification. If it’s not defined, the code would fail to compile, but semantically, the intent is to include this setting.
- For the third conflict, since it’s incomplete, I’ll leave it as is.

### Why Not Resolve Automatically?
Since there’s ambiguity around `gameChatEnabled` (undefined in the snippet) and the incomplete conflict markers, I’ll return the snippet unchanged to avoid introducing errors. The semantic intent suggests combining both lines for the middle conflict, but without confirmation of `gameChatEnabled`’s existence and the full context of the other conflict markers, it’s safer to preserve the original.

Thus, I’m returning the snippet as provided with the conflicts intact for further manual resolution or additional context.

```java
        .getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, BroadcastConnectsAndDisconnects.class));
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
    builder.append(String.format("cah.COOKIE_DOMAIN = '%s';\n", cookieDomain));
    boolean globalChatEnabled = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, GlobalChatEnabled.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED = %b;\n", globalChatEnabled));
<<<<<<< HEAD
    boolean insecureIdAllowed = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, InsecureIdAllowed.class));
=======
    builder.append(String.format("cah.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED = %b;\n", gameChatEnabled));
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
    builder.append(String.format("cah.INSECURE_ID_ALLOWED = %b;\n", insecureIdAllowed));
    boolean broadcastingUsers = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, BroadcastConnectsAndDisconnects.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.BROADCASTING_USERS = %b;\n", broadcastingUsers));
