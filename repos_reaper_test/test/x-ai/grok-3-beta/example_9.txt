I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet as requested. Based on the provided code, it appears there's a method `disconnected()` on one side of the merge (HEAD) that seems to be intended to handle disconnection logic by stopping something with a message. The other side of the merge (the commit `0fe5af607...`) does not include this method, which might indicate it was either removed or not yet added in that branch. Since the intent of preserving or removing the `disconnected()` method is unclear without further context about the overall codebase or the purpose of the branches, I will return the snippet with the conflict markers intact as provided.

Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved:

```java
			throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to add new world to the scheduler");
		}
		return world;
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	public void disconnected() {
		stop("Disconnected for some unknown reason!");
	}

=======
>>>>>>> 0fe5af60744a5d107c5cb51f9bbbdb1ea2d05dfe
	@Override
	public FileSystem getFileSystem() {
		return filesystem;
	}


```

**Analysis of Intent and Semantics**:
- **HEAD**: Introduces or retains a `disconnected()` method that calls `stop()` with a disconnection message. The intent seems to be handling a disconnection event, possibly for cleanup or state management.
- **Other Side (commit `0fe5af607...`)**: Lacks the `disconnected()` method, which could mean it was intentionally removed, not yet implemented, or is irrelevant in that branch's context.
- **Ambiguity**: Without additional context about the purpose of the `disconnected()` method, whether it's critical to the functionality, or the goals of each branch, it's safer to leave the conflict unresolved. If the `disconnected()` method is part of a feature or fix in HEAD, it might need to be retained; if the other branch deliberately omitted it, it might need to be discarded.

If you have additional context about the branches or the role of `disconnected()`, I can provide a more specific resolution. For now, the snippet is returned as is with the conflict markers.
