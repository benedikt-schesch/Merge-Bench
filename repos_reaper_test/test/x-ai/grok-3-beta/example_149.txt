Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent behind the changes is not entirely clear without additional context about the purpose of `myPig`. I will also provide an analysis of potential intents and a suggested resolution if the intent can be inferred.

### Code Snippet with Conflict (Unmodified)
```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "describe b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

<<<<<<< HEAD
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));
=======
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
>>>>>>> 2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```

### Analysis of Intent
- **HEAD**: The code uses a single-argument constructor for `GruntParser` with `StringReader(script)`. This suggests a simpler or possibly older version of the API where no additional context or configuration (like `myPig`) is required.
- **Branch (2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea)**: The code uses a two-argument constructor for `GruntParser` with an additional `myPig` parameter. This likely indicates that the `GruntParser` needs a reference to a `PigServer` or similar object to provide runtime context or configuration for parsing Pig scripts.

### Semantic Intent
- Both sides aim to create a `GruntParser` instance to parse a Pig script provided as a string.
- The difference lies in whether additional context (`myPig`) is necessary for parsing. The branch version suggests that `myPig` might be required to access specific Pig runtime configurations or to integrate with a larger system, while the HEAD version assumes a standalone or default configuration.

### Potential Resolution
If the intent of the branch is to provide necessary runtime context via `myPig` (e.g., a `PigServer` instance), the branch version should likely be adopted, assuming `myPig` is defined and available in the surrounding code. However, without explicit confirmation or additional context about `myPig`'s role and whether it is essential for the parsing logic, I will not modify the snippet.

If you can confirm the purpose of `myPig` or provide more context about the codebase (e.g., its declaration or initialization), I can provide a definitive resolution. For now, I preserve the conflict as is per the instructions.

If you wish to proceed with a speculative resolution favoring the branch (assuming `myPig` is required), it would look like this (though I will not include it in the final output since the intent is ambiguous):

```java
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
```

Please provide additional context or clarification if possible to resolve this definitively.
