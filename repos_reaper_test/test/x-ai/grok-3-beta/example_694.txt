I'm returning the provided code snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent of the changes on both sides is ambiguous without additional context about the purpose of the code or the desired behavior for the `inline-text-message` case. Below is the snippet exactly as provided, preserving all spacing and context.

```java
					out.append(" data-structr-failure-notifications-custom-dialog-element=\"").append(generateDataAttributesForIdList(renderContext, triggeredAction, ActionMapping.failureNotificationElements)).append("\"");
					break;

				case "fire-event":
					out.append(" data-structr-failure-notifications-event=\"").append(triggeredAction.getProperty(ActionMapping.failureNotificationsEventProperty)).append("\"");
<<<<<<< HEAD
					break;

				case "inline-text-message":
					final Integer delay = triggeredAction.getProperty(StructrApp.key(ActionMapping.class, "failureNotificationsDelay"));
					out.append(" data-structr-failure-notifications-delay=\"").append(delay.toString()).append("\"");

				default:

```

**Analysis of Intent and Semantics:**
- **HEAD Side**: Adds logic for the `inline-text-message` case to include a delay attribute (`data-structr-failure-notifications-delay`) based on a property fetched from `triggeredAction`. The intent seems to be providing a configurable delay for failure notifications in this specific case.
- **Other Side (d72e83e)**: Appears to leave the `inline-text-message` case empty or unchanged, with no additional attributes or logic. The intent here is unclear without further context—possibly to keep the behavior minimal or to avoid adding the delay attribute.

**Reason for Not Resolving**:
Without additional information about the overall design or purpose (e.g., whether the delay attribute is necessary, deprecated, or conditionally required), I cannot confidently determine the correct resolution. The HEAD side introduces new functionality, but it's unclear if this aligns with the project’s goals or if the other side intended to omit this behavior deliberately. If you can provide more context about the feature or the desired behavior for `inline-text-message`, I can assist in resolving the conflict.
