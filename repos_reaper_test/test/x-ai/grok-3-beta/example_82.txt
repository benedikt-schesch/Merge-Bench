I'm returning the provided snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge are not entirely clear without additional context about the purpose of the classes `CustomBlackCard` and `CardcastBlackCard`. The conflict involves different class names and parameter names (`watermark` vs. `deckId`), which suggests they may represent distinct entities or have different behaviors despite sharing similar structures. Resolving this would require understanding whether these are meant to be the same class with a name change or if they should remain separate with distinct implementations.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
  private final String text;
  private final int draw;
  private final int pick;
  private final String watermark;

<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomBlackCard.java
  public CustomBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick, final String watermark) {
=======
  public CardcastBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick,
                           final String deckId) {
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/cardcast/CardcastBlackCard.java
    this.id = id;
    this.text = text;
    this.draw = draw;
    this.pick = pick;
    this.watermark = watermark;
