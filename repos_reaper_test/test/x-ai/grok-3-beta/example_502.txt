I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent behind the changes is ambiguous without further context about the specific library or framework being used. The conflict involves a difference in class names (`BitmapTexture` vs. `BitmapTextureAtlas`), and I cannot determine which is the correct or intended class to use based on the provided code alone. Below is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
		return new LimitedFPSEngine(engineOptions, FPS);
	}

	@Override
	public void onLoadResources() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.mScoreFontTexture = new BitmapTexture(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
=======
		this.mScoreFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d

		FontFactory.setAssetBasePath("font/");
		this.mScoreFont = FontFactory.createFromAsset(this.mScoreFontTexture, this, "LCD.ttf", 32, true, Color.WHITE);

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mScoreFontTexture);
```

**Rationale for not resolving the conflict:**  
The difference between `BitmapTexture` and `BitmapTextureAtlas` likely reflects a change in the library or codebase (possibly related to the AndEngine framework, which uses these classes). Without additional context about the version of the library, the intended functionality, or the surrounding codebase, it’s unclear which class should be used. `BitmapTextureAtlas` might be a newer or more specific implementation, while `BitmapTexture` could be a legacy or different approach. Resolving this conflict requires input from the developers or documentation to confirm the correct class. Therefore, I’ve left the conflict markers intact for further review.
