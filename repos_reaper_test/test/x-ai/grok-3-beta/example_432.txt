Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics of the conflicting changes are ambiguous without additional context. I have included the full context as provided, with no modifications to the spacing or content.

```java
                    } else {
                        VideoUtils.playVideo(new WeakReference<Activity>(getActivity()), (Video) item);
                    }
                } else if (item instanceof String && ((String) item).contains(getString(R.string.add_source))) {
                    showAddSourceDialog();
<<<<<<< HEAD
                } else if (item instanceof String && ((String) item).contains(getString(R.string.customization))) {
                    showCustomizeDialog();

                }
            }
        };
    }
```

**Analysis and Reasoning:**  
The merge conflict involves a conditional block on the `HEAD` side that adds a new `else if` condition to check for a string item containing `R.string.customization` and calls `showCustomizeDialog()` if the condition is met. On the other branch (commit `308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5`), there are no changes in this section, effectively leaving the code block empty or unchanged.

While the intent on the `HEAD` side seems to be adding new functionality for customization, it's unclear whether this change should be retained or discarded without additional context about the purpose of the branch or the overall application logic. The other side's intent (or lack of change) might indicate that this customization feature is not needed or was not included in that branch. Since the semantics of whether to include this feature are ambiguous, I have preserved the conflict as is for manual resolution by someone with deeper context of the project.
