I'm returning the entire snippet with the merge conflict as provided, since the intent behind the version number change could be ambiguous without additional context. My analysis is that one side (HEAD) uses a `-SNAPSHOT` suffix, which typically indicates a development or pre-release version, while the other side (commit `7b61f14a88a9c125a24ba8dc93b98a8648e4cb70`) uses a clean version number, likely indicating a stable release. However, I cannot definitively determine which version is intended without further information on the projectâ€™s release status or versioning policy.

Here is the unchanged code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
        return "speedment";
    }

    @Override
    public String getImplementationVersion() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        return "3.1.12-SNAPSHOT";
=======
        return "3.1.12";
>>>>>>> 7b61f14a88a9c125a24ba8dc93b98a8648e4cb70
    }

    @Override
    public String getVendor() {
        return "Speedment, Inc.";
```

If you have additional context about whether this should be a snapshot or release version, I can assist in resolving the conflict.
