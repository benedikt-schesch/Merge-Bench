Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including the context, spacing, and conflict markers. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge to propose a resolution. Following the snippet, I will explain my reasoning and provide the resolved code if the intent is clear.

```java
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        } else {
            // It might be a glob
            if (!globMatchesFiles(elem, elem.getDataStorage())) {
                throw new IOException(elem.toString() + " does not exist");
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
                
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics:
- **Context**: The code appears to handle file or data element processing, potentially with support for glob patterns. The logic checks if a given `elem` matches existing files using `globMatchesFiles`. If it does not match, an `IOException` is thrown.
- **Conflict Details**:
  - **HEAD**: The `HEAD` side does not include additional logic inside the `else` block for when `globMatchesFiles` returns `true`. It simply closes the `if` condition and falls through to the `return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);` statement outside the `else` block.
  - **Incoming Change (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309)**: The incoming change adds explicit logic inside the `else` block to handle the case when `globMatchesFiles` returns `true`. It assigns `elements` using `getFileElementDescriptors(elem)` and immediately returns a `DataStorageInputStreamIterator` with the updated `elements`.
- **Intent**:
  - **HEAD**: Likely assumes that `elements` is already populated or will be handled outside this block, so it does not modify or return anything specific inside the `else` block.
  - **Incoming Change**: Intends to explicitly handle the case where `globMatchesFiles` returns `true` by populating `elements` with the result of `getFileElementDescriptors(elem)` and returning a new iterator immediately, avoiding any further processing.
- **Semantic Difference**: The key difference is whether to handle the `globMatchesFiles == true` case explicitly within the `else` block (incoming change) or rely on external logic (HEAD). The incoming change seems to be more explicit and proactive in handling the glob match case by updating and returning immediately.
- **Ambiguity**: It is unclear whether `elements` is guaranteed to be populated before reaching this point in the `HEAD` version. If it is not, the `HEAD` version could lead to incorrect behavior. The incoming change avoids this risk by ensuring `elements` is updated.

### Resolution Decision:
Given that the incoming change (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309) provides a clearer and more explicit handling of the glob match case, and potentially avoids issues with uninitialized or incorrect `elements`, I believe the intent of the incoming change should be prioritized. However, I will preserve the outer `return` statement as it might be relevant to other logic paths not shown in this snippet.

### Resolved Code:
```java
        } else {
            // It might be a glob
            if (!globMatchesFiles(elem, elem.getDataStorage())) {
                throw new IOException(elem.toString() + " does not exist");
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
```

### Explanation of Resolution:
- Adopted the incoming change's explicit handling inside the `else` block to ensure `elements` is updated and returned immediately when a glob match is found.
- Preserved the outer `return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);` statement as it may apply to other conditions or logic branches not visible in the provided context.
- This resolution avoids potential issues with uninitialized `elements` (as might occur in the `HEAD` version) while maintaining compatibility with surrounding code. If this outer `return` statement is redundant or incorrect in the broader context, it can be revisited during further review or testing.
