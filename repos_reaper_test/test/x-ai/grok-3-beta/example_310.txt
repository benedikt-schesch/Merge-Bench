I'll return the snippet with the conflict unresolved since the intent and semantics are ambiguous without additional context about the database structure or migration strategy. Both sides of the merge seem to be fetching tweets/messages from a database, but they reference different database access methods (`getDb()` vs. `getDb2()`) and different table identifiers (`TwitterDbAdapter.TABLE_TWEET` vs. `StatusTable.TABLE_NAME`). Without further information about whether this is part of a database migration, a refactoring, or something else, I cannot confidently resolve the conflict.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
		}
	}

	@Override
	protected Cursor fetchMessages() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		return getDb().fetchAllTweets(TwitterDbAdapter.TABLE_TWEET);
=======
		return getDb2().fetchAllTweets(StatusTable.TABLE_NAME);
>>>>>>> de460f053e7948460b81e71a410d665d956db90a
	}

	@Override
	protected String getActivityTitle() {
		return getResources().getString(R.string.page_title_home);
```
