I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. The conflict arises from two different approaches to initializing an `ArrayList` and creating an array copy of `players`. Let's look at the intent and semantics of both sides:

- **HEAD**: Uses `players.toArray(new Player[players.size()])` to create an array of the exact size needed and initializes the `ArrayList` with `new ArrayList<User>(playersCopy.length)`. The intent seems to be explicit about the array size for performance optimization.
- **Branch (5adedd248...)**: Uses `players.toArray(new Player[0])` to let the `toArray` method dynamically allocate the array and initializes the `ArrayList` with `new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length)`. The intent here also focuses on creating an array copy, but uses a more concise way to let the method handle the size allocation.

**Analysis**: Both sides aim to achieve the same goal—converting a collection of `Player` objects to an array and initializing an `ArrayList` with the correct capacity to store `User` objects. The difference is stylistic and minor in terms of performance. Using `new Player[0]` is a common idiom in Java to let `toArray` handle the type and size dynamically, and it’s more concise. The initialization of `ArrayList` with capacity is the same in effect on both sides.

**Resolution**: I’ll resolve the conflict by adopting the more concise and idiomatic approach from the branch (`new Player[0]`), as it achieves the same result with less explicit code, which aligns with common Java practices.

Here is the resolved code snippet with the full context preserved exactly as provided:

```java
  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
   */
  private List<User> playersToUsers() {
    final List<User> users;
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    users = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      users.add(player.getUser());
    }
    synchronized (spectators) {
      users.addAll(spectators);
```
