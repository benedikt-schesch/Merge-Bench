I will preserve the provided code snippet with the full context exactly as given and resolve the merge conflict based on the semantic intent. Both sides of the merge conflict are identical in terms of content (`boolean[] inner = {false};`), with the only difference being a trailing space on the right-hand side (`>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`). Since this is purely a whitespace difference and does not affect the semantics or intent of the code, I will resolve it by keeping the more concise version without the trailing space.

Here is the resolved code snippet with the full context preserved:

```java
        POPackage pkg = new POPackage(new OperatorKey(scope,nig.getNextNodeId(scope)));
        Packager pkgr = new Packager();
        pkg.setPkgr(pkgr);
        pkgr.setKeyType(DataType.CHARARRAY);
        pkg.setNumInps(1);
        boolean[] inner = {false};
        pkgr.setInner(inner);
        mro.reducePlan.add(pkg);

        // Lets start building the plan which will have the sort
        // for the foreach
```
