I'll return the snippet with the resolved merge conflict. The intent from both sides of the merge appears to be the sameâ€”handling an exception when setting the system look and feel. The only difference is the spacing in the `catch` statement. Semantically, both sides are identical in purpose, so I'll resolve it by choosing one consistent style (removing the extra space for uniformity, as it's a minor formatting difference and does not affect functionality).

Here is the snippet with the resolved conflict:

```java
	 */
	public static void createAndShowGUI() {
		Log.d(LOG_TAG, "set to system default LaF");
		try {
			UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
		} catch (Exception ex) {
			System.out.println("Cannot find system look and feel, setting to metal.");
		}
		Log.d(LOG_TAG, "createAndShowGUI");
		flingFrame = new FlingFrame();
		// change the default app icon; might not work for all platforms
```
