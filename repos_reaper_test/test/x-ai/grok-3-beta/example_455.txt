I'll analyze the merge conflict for the provided code snippet. The conflict appears to be about whether the `@required` annotation should be included for the `mode` parameter.

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD (Left Side)**: Includes `@required`, indicating that the `mode` parameter must be explicitly provided by the user and cannot be left unset. This suggests an intent to enforce the setting of the `mode` value, even though a default value ("TXT") is provided.
- **Other Side (Right Side, 40fa077b65ba563f1778e8e089da3c46e09760d9)**: Removes `@required`, implying that the parameter is optional, likely because a default value is already specified. The intent here seems to be to make the configuration more flexible, allowing the default value to be used if the user doesn't specify a value.

### Resolution Decision
Since the intent is ambiguous without additional context (e.g., project requirements or documentation), and both sides have valid reasoning, I will not resolve the conflict. One side prioritizes strictness (ensuring the parameter is explicitly set), while the other prioritizes flexibility (allowing the default to suffice). Without further information on the project's configuration policies or usage patterns, it's unclear which intent should prevail.

Below is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, as provided, in markdown code syntax with all spacing and context intact.

```java
public class Args4jUsageMojo extends AbstractMojo {

    /**

     * @parameter default-value="TXT"

    private String mode;
