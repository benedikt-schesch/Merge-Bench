Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including spacing and context. After the snippet, I will provide an explanation of the conflict and my resolution or reasoning for leaving it unresolved.

```java
   * Represents the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/video-format/">Video Format Graph
   * API type</a>.
   */
  public static class VideoFormat extends AbstractFacebookType {

     * 
     * @return HTML to embed the video in this format.
     */
```

### Explanation and Resolution

**Conflict Analysis:**
- On the `HEAD` side of the conflict, there is a line of code: `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;`. This suggests that the class `VideoFormat` is intended to be serializable, and the `serialVersionUID` is explicitly defined to ensure compatibility during serialization/deserialization.
- On the other side of the conflict (commit `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`), there is no code or content added in this sectionâ€”just an empty merge marker. This could indicate that this branch did not introduce or require the `serialVersionUID` field, or it might be an accidental omission.
- Below the conflict markers, the context continues with a comment describing a method or field related to embedding HTML for the video format, which is unaffected by the conflict.

**Semantic Intent:**
- The intent of the `HEAD` side appears to be ensuring serialization compatibility by explicitly defining `serialVersionUID`, which is a good practice for classes extending `Serializable` (or indirectly through `AbstractFacebookType` if it implements `Serializable`).
- The intent of the other side is unclear since it introduces no content in this conflicting section. It might imply that `serialVersionUID` is not needed (e.g., if the class is not serialized in that branch), or it could be an oversight during merging.

**Resolution Decision:**
Since the intent of the other branch (commit `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) is ambiguous and provides no content in the conflicting area, I would resolve the conflict by retaining the `HEAD` side's change. Defining a `serialVersionUID` is generally a safe and recommended practice for serializable classes to avoid runtime issues with deserialization due to compiler-generated IDs changing across builds.

However, as per the instruction to return the snippet unresolved if the intent is ambiguous, and since I cannot definitively confirm whether the class needs to be serializable without broader context (e.g., whether `AbstractFacebookType` implements `Serializable`), I will leave the conflict markers intact in the returned snippet as shown above. If further context or clarification is provided (e.g., serialization requirements), I can revisit the resolution.
