I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the resolved code snippet. The conflict is between two branches, where the only difference is in the capitalization of `instanceOf`. Let's look at the intent and semantics:

- **HEAD branch**: Uses `instanceOf` with a lowercase 'o'.
- **7d8e78a2 branch**: Uses `instanceOf` with a capitalized 'O' as `instanceOf`.

In Hamcrest matchers (used in the `assertThat` statement), the correct method is `instanceOf` with a lowercase 'o'. The HEAD branch is semantically correct, while the other branch appears to have a capitalization typo. Both sides intend to check if `scheme` is an instance of the `Url` class, so the correct resolution is to use the HEAD branch's code.

Here is the resolved code snippet with the full context preserved:

```java

	@Test
	public void parseUrlCode() throws Exception {
		Object scheme = createParser().parse("http://www.github.org/QRCode");
		assertNotNull(scheme);
		assertThat(scheme,instanceOf(Url.class));
		Url urlCode = (Url) scheme;
		assertEquals("http://www.github.org/QRCode", urlCode.getUrl());
	}

	@Test(expected = UnsupportedEncodingException.class)

```
