Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given with all spacing and context intact. Below the snippet, I will explain my reasoning regarding the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge to propose a resolution.

```java
        }
        return resolveClassName(className);
    }
  
    public Object instantiateFuncFromAlias(String alias) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        String funcSpec;
=======
        FuncSpec funcSpec;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        if (definedFunctions != null && (funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias))!=null)
            return instantiateFuncFromSpec(funcSpec);
        else
            return instantiateFuncFromSpec(alias);
    }
```

### Analysis and Resolution Reasoning

Let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict:

- **HEAD (Current Branch)**: Declares `funcSpec` as a `String`. This suggests that `definedFunctions` is likely a map or collection that stores function specifications as strings, and `instantiateFuncFromSpec` accepts a `String` parameter. The intent seems to be treating the function specification as a raw string value, perhaps to be parsed or processed as a string input.
  
- **1488b22 (Incoming Branch)**: Declares `funcSpec` as a `FuncSpec` type. This implies a more structured or object-oriented approach, where `FuncSpec` is likely a custom class or interface representing a function specification. The intent here seems to be to work with a typed object, possibly providing better encapsulation, type safety, or additional metadata/methods associated with the function specification. It also suggests that `definedFunctions` returns `FuncSpec` objects, and `instantiateFuncFromSpec` is designed to accept a `FuncSpec` parameter.

### Semantic Intent Reconciliation

The key difference is in the type of `funcSpec`: `String` versus `FuncSpec`. To resolve this, we need to consider the broader context and purpose of the code:
- If `definedFunctions` stores and returns `String` values, then HEAD's approach (`String funcSpec`) is semantically correct for the current implementation.
- If `definedFunctions` stores and returns a custom `FuncSpec` type, or if there is an intent to refactor toward a more structured representation of function specifications, then the incoming branch's approach (`FuncSpec funcSpec`) aligns with that goal.

Since the context provided is limited and does not include the declaration of `definedFunctions` or the signature of `instantiateFuncFromSpec`, I cannot definitively determine which type is correct without risking incorrect assumptions. However, based on modern programming practices favoring type safety and encapsulation, it is likely that the incoming branch (`FuncSpec`) represents a deliberate refactor or improvement.

### Additional Consideration

There is a risk in choosing `FuncSpec` if the rest of the codebase (e.g., `instantiateFuncFromSpec`) expects a `String`, as this could lead to compilation errors or runtime issues. Conversely, sticking with `String` might ignore an intended refactoring effort in the incoming branch.

### Proposed Resolution

Given the ambiguity and lack of full context (e.g., the type returned by `definedFunctions.get()` or the parameter type of `instantiateFuncFromSpec`), I will err on the side of preserving the conflict for now to avoid making an incorrect assumption. If I had to hypothesize, I would lean toward `FuncSpec` as it suggests a more robust design, but this needs validation with the broader codebase.

Thus, I am returning the snippet as-is with the conflict markers intact, as the intent cannot be fully resolved without additional information. If more context is provided (such as the definition of `definedFunctions` or `instantiateFuncFromSpec`), I can revisit and finalize the resolution.

If you have additional context or guidance on the expected type, please provide it, and I will refine the resolution accordingly.
