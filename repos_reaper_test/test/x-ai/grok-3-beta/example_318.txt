I'll analyze this merge conflict in terms of semantic intent and provide the resolved snippet while preserving the exact context and formatting as provided.

```java
			mSourceColumn = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_SOURCE);
			mInReplyToScreenName = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_IN_REPLY_TO_SCREEN_NAME);
			mFavorited = cursor
<<<<<<< HEAD
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(TwitterDbAdapter.KEY_FAVORITED);
		} 
=======
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED);
		}
>>>>>>> 9734ffd77100479d84522d730522fefa5d6e8522
		mMetaBuilder = new StringBuilder();
	}

	private LayoutInflater mInflater;
```

**Analysis of Intent:**
- On the `HEAD` side, the code references `TwitterDbAdapter.KEY_FAVORITED` for the column name.
- On the `9734ffd77100479d84522d730522fefa5d6e8522` side, the code uses `StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED`.

**Semantic Understanding:**
- The intent on both sides is to retrieve the column index for a "favorited" field from a database cursor.
- The difference lies in which class or constant is being used to reference the field name. `TwitterDbAdapter.KEY_FAVORITED` suggests an older or different naming convention or class structure, while `StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED` appears to align with the pattern used in the surrounding code (e.g., `StatusTable.FIELD_SOURCE` and `StatusTable.FIELD_IN_REPLY_TO_SCREEN_NAME`).
- Given the context of the surrounding code, it seems the intent is to maintain consistency in using `StatusTable` for field references.

**Resolution Decision:**
However, since I am not entirely sure of the broader codebase context (e.g., whether `TwitterDbAdapter.KEY_FAVORITED` is still valid or deprecated), and the intent could be ambiguous without further information about the database schema or migration history, I will refrain from resolving the conflict and return the snippet as is with the conflict markers intact. If additional context were provided (e.g., which constant is the current standard), I could make a definitive resolution.

The snippet remains unchanged as requested when the intent is ambiguous.
