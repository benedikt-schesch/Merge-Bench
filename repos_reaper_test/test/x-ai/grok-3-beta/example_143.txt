I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict resolved based on the semantic intent of both changes. My analysis is that both sides are attempting to describe the error message for a failure during job launching, but the diff√©rence lies in the specificity of the job type. The HEAD version specifies "map reduce job," which is more specific, while the other branch uses a generic "job." Resolving this, I will prefer the more specific description from HEAD as it provides clearer context about the type of job, which aligns better with detailed error reporting.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, with the full context preserved and spacing unchanged:

```java
        public void uncaughtException(Thread thread, Throwable throwable) {
            jobControlExceptionStackTrace = Utils.getStackStraceStr(throwable);
            try {
                jobControlException = getExceptionFromString(jobControlExceptionStackTrace);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                String errMsg = "Could not resolve error that occured when launching map reduce job: "
                        + jobControlExceptionStackTrace;
                jobControlException = new RuntimeException(errMsg, throwable);
            }
        }
    }
```
