Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including all context and spacing. After that, I will provide an analysis of the conflict and my resolution based on the semantic intent of both sides.

```java
            ListRow row = findListRow(getString(R.string.unmatched));

            // if found add this video
            // if not, create a new row and add it
            if (row != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
                ((SortedArrayObjectAdapter) row.getAdapter()).add(video);
            } else {
                SortedArrayObjectAdapter listRowAdapter = new SortedArrayObjectAdapter(

                ((SortedObjectAdapter) row.getAdapter()).add(video);
            } else {
                SortedObjectAdapter listRowAdapter = new SortedObjectAdapter(

                        videoNameComparator, mCardPresenter);
                listRowAdapter.add(video);

                HeaderItem header = new HeaderItem(0, getString(R.string.unmatched), null);
                int index = mAdapter.size() > 1 ? mAdapter.size() - 1 : 0;
```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Conflict Description:**
The conflict revolves around the type of adapter used for managing a row of videos in what appears to be an Android Leanback library context (used for TV apps). There are two versions of the adapter class involved:
- `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` (from the `HEAD` branch)
- `SortedObjectAdapter` (from the branch with commit `308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5`)

The difference appears in two places:
1. When adding a video to an existing row's adapter.
2. When creating a new adapter for a new row.

**Semantic Intent:**
- Both sides aim to manage a list of videos in a sorted manner for display in a `ListRow`.
- The difference in class names suggests a possible refactoring or library update. Itâ€™s likely that `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` and `SortedObjectAdapter` serve the same purpose or one is a newer version of the other. The Leanback library typically uses `ObjectAdapter` subclasses for managing data in rows, and sorting is a common requirement for such lists.
- The rest of the code (adding videos, creating headers, etc.) remains identical, indicating that the functionality is intended to be the same regardless of the specific adapter class.

**Resolution Hypothesis:**
Without explicit documentation or additional context about the library version or project history, the resolution hinges on determining which adapter class is the correct or most current one to use. Given that `HEAD` typically represents the current branch (likely the more up-to-date code), I will lean toward using `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` as it might reflect a recent update or correction. However, to ensure correctness, this choice should ideally be validated with the project's dependencies and library version.

**Resolved Code:**
Since I must provide a resolution and assuming `HEAD` is the more current branch, I will resolve the conflict in favor of `SortedArrayObjectAdapter`. Below is the resolved snippet:

```java
            ListRow row = findListRow(getString(R.string.unmatched));

            // if found add this video
            // if not, create a new row and add it
            if (row != null) {
                ((SortedArrayObjectAdapter) row.getAdapter()).add(video);
            } else {
                SortedArrayObjectAdapter listRowAdapter = new SortedArrayObjectAdapter(
                        videoNameComparator, mCardPresenter);
                listRowAdapter.add(video);

                HeaderItem header = new HeaderItem(0, getString(R.string.unmatched), null);
                int index = mAdapter.size() > 1 ? mAdapter.size() - 1 : 0;
```

**Note:**
If there is uncertainty about which adapter class to use (e.g., due to library version differences or unclear project history), I recommend checking the project's dependency on the Android Leanback library and confirming the correct class. If the intent remains ambiguous after further investigation, the conflict should be left unresolved until a developer or maintainer can provide clarity. For now, I have resolved it based on the assumption that `HEAD` contains the intended implementation.
