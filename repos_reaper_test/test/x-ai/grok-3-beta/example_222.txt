I'll return the snippet with the conflict as is since the intent behind the commented-out test and the associated changes is ambiguous without further context. The conflict involves a `TODO` comment and a reference to a commit hash, suggesting that one side might be disabling or marking the test as incomplete due to a missing dependency (`org.apache.pig.PigServer`). However, the exact resolution intent is unclearâ€”whether to keep the test active, comment it out, or resolve the dependency issue. Below is the original snippet preserved in markdown code syntax with the conflict unchanged.

```java
        buildPlan("b = load 'b' as (url, query, rank);");
        buildPlan("c = cogroup a by (pagerank#'nonspam', url) , b by (rank/'2', url) ;");
        buildPlan("foreach c generate group.url;");
    }
