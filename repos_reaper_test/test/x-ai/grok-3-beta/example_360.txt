I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet with my resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

```java

public final class HttpRequest {

  /** User agent suffix for all requests. */
<<<<<<< HEAD:google-api-client/src/main/java/com/google/api/client/http/HttpRequest.java
  private static final String USER_AGENT_SUFFIX = "Google-API-Java-Client/" + Strings.VERSION;

  private static final String USER_AGENT_SUFFIX = "Google-API-Java-Client/1.2.4-alpha";

```

**Analysis and Resolution Reasoning:**

After analyzing the conflict, I have decided to leave the conflict markers as is in the snippet because the intent behind the changes is ambiguous without additional context:

- **HEAD (Left Side)**: Uses a dynamic version string by concatenating `"Google-API-Java-Client/"` with `Strings.VERSION`. The intent appears to be making the user agent suffix adaptable to different versions programmatically, likely to ensure the version is always up-to-date with the build or configuration.
- **Other Branch (Right Side)**: Hardcodes a specific version `"Google-API-Java-Client/1.2.4-alpha"`. The intent here might be to pin a specific version for stability, testing, or compatibility reasons, especially since it includes an alpha tag, which may indicate a pre-release or experimental build.

**Semantic Conflict**: The conflict lies in whether the version should be dynamically determined at runtime (HEAD) or statically defined with a specific version (other branch). Without additional information about the project's versioning strategy, release process, or the context of the alpha version, it's unclear which approach aligns better with the overall intent.

Therefore, I am returning the snippet unchanged with the conflict markers intact, as resolving this requires input from the developers or additional context about the project's requirements for user agent versioning. If you have further context or guidelines on the preferred approach (e.g., always use dynamic versioning or prioritize specific versions for alpha builds), I can adjust the resolution accordingly.
