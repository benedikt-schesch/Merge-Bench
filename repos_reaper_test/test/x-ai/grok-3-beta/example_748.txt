I'll first present the code snippet with the conflict as provided, preserving the exact context and spacing. Then, I'll explain my analysis of the merge conflict and suggest a resolution based on intent and semantics.

Here is the unchanged code snippet with the conflict:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.tasks.Task;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.impl.ParallelComponentFactory;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.impl.ParallelEngine;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.impl.SimpleComponentFactory;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.impl.SimpleEngine;

import com.github.javacliparser.FlagOption;
import com.github.javacliparser.IntOption;
import com.github.javacliparser.Option;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.tasks.Task;
```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Intent and Semantics Analysis:**
- **HEAD Side (Left Side):** This side includes imports for specific implementations related to the `samoa` topology, such as `ParallelComponentFactory`, `ParallelEngine`, `SimpleComponentFactory`, and `SimpleEngine`. The intent appears to be focused on enabling specific topology engines and component factories for the codebase, likely for distributed or parallel processing setups. It also imports `Task` from `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.tasks`.
- **Other Side (Right Side, commit `87ea390f`):** This side includes imports for configuration and option handling classes from `javacliparser` (`ClassOption`, `FlagOption`, `IntOption`, `Option`). The intent here seems to be focused on enabling command-line argument parsing or configuration options for the application. It also imports `Task` from `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.tasks`, which overlaps with the HEAD side.
- **Overlap and Conflict:** The conflict arises because the two sides have modified the imports in the same area of the file but with different sets of dependencies. The HEAD side adds topology-related imports, while the other side adds configuration-related imports. Both sides include the `Task` import, indicating a common dependency.
- **Ambiguity Check:** The intent of both sides seems clear and complementary. There is no indication that these imports are mutually exclusive or would cause issues if combined. The HEAD side focuses on implementation details for topology, while the other side focuses on configuration utilities. Combining them likely aligns with the overall goal of the codebase to support both topology implementations and configuration handling.

**Resolution Strategy:**
Since the intents of both sides are distinct yet compatible, the best approach is to merge the imports from both sides, avoiding duplicates. This preserves the functionality intended by both changes. Specifically:
- Include all unique imports from HEAD (topology-related classes).
- Include all unique imports from the other side (configuration-related classes).
- Retain the common `Task` import only once.

Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict merged:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import com.github.javacliparser.ClassOption;
import com.github.javacliparser.FlagOption;
import com.github.javacliparser.IntOption;
import com.github.javacliparser.Option;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.tasks.Task;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.impl.ParallelComponentFactory;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.impl.ParallelEngine;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.impl.SimpleComponentFactory;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.impl.SimpleEngine;
```

**Explanation of Resolution:**
- I combined all imports from both sides, ensuring no duplicates (e.g., `Task` appears only once).
- I maintained the original spacing and context as provided in the snippet.
- The resolved version supports both the topology implementation requirements (from HEAD) and the configuration handling requirements (from the other side), aligning with the semantic intent of both changes.

If there is any specific reason (e.g., project conventions or dependency conflicts) that these imports should not be combined, please provide additional context, and I can revisit the resolution. For now, this merged version appears to be the most semantically appropriate solution.
