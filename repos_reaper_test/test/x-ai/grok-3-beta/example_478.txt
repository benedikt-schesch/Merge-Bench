I'm returning the provided snippet with the merge conflict resolved. After analyzing the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge, it appears that the conflict involves the inclusion of an additional import statement on the `e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885` side. The intent of the change seems to be to add necessary functionality related to texture region creation, which is not present in the `HEAD` version. Since there are no conflicting changes (i.e., `HEAD` does not remove or modify imports that clash with the added line), the semantic intent is to include the additional import while preserving all other imports.

Here is the resolved code snippet with full context, in markdown code syntax as provided, with spacing preserved:
