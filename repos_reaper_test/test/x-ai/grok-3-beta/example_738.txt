I'll return the snippet with the conflict unresolved since the intent of the changes on both sides is ambiguous. The `HEAD` side repeats the same logic for `finalPos` with a slight formatting difference (using a single-line `if` statement), but it does not add any new functionality or semantic change. The other side (merge commit) appears to have no changes in the conflicting region, which could imply an intent to keep the original code or might be a result of an incomplete merge. Without additional context or commit messages, it's unclear whether the repetition in `HEAD` is intentional (e.g., for clarity or future modification) or accidental. Therefore, I'll preserve the original snippet with the conflict markers as provided.

```java
        float finalPos = getTranslationY() + distance;
        if (finalPos > 0) {
            finalPos = 0;
        }

<<<<<<< HEAD
        float finalPos = getTranslationY() + distance;
        if (finalPos > 0) finalPos = 0;

        setTranslationY(finalPos);

        if (getAlpha() == 0.0f) {
            setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
            setAlpha(1.0f);
