Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I will also explain my thought process regarding the potential resolution of the conflict based on semantic intent.

```java
  /**
   * Returns whether the transport is mTLS.
   *
   * @return boolean indicating if the transport is mTLS.
   */
<<<<<<< HEAD
  @Beta
=======
>>>>>>> 51762f221ec8ab38da03149c8012e63aec0433dc
  public boolean isMtls() {
    return false;
  }

  /**
```

### Thought Process on Merge Conflict Resolution:

- **Context Analysis**: The conflict arises around the presence of the `@Beta` annotation above the `isMtls()` method. On the `HEAD` side, the `@Beta` annotation is included, indicating that this method is considered experimental or subject to change. On the other branch (commit `51762f221ec8ab38da03149c8012e63aec0433dc`), the annotation is absent, suggesting that the method is either no longer considered beta or the annotation was intentionally removed.
  
- **Semantic Intent**: 
  - The `HEAD` side likely intends to mark the `isMtls()` method as beta to caution users or developers about its stability or potential for future changes.
  - The other branch might intend to finalize or stabilize the method by removing the `@Beta` annotation, or it could simply be an omission.
  - The method implementation itself (`return false;`) remains unchanged in both branches, so the conflict is purely about metadata (the annotation) rather than functionality.

- **Resolution Consideration**: Without additional context about the project’s policies on `@Beta` annotations or the history of this method, it is ambiguous whether the annotation should be kept or removed. Retaining `@Beta` is safer if the method’s stability is still under review. However, if the branch removing it reflects a deliberate decision to promote the method to a stable state, the annotation should be omitted.

- **Decision**: Due to the ambiguity in intent and lack of further context (e.g., commit messages, project guidelines, or discussion on the method’s status), I am leaving the conflict unresolved in the returned snippet as requested. If additional information were available, such as confirmation that the method is no longer beta, I would remove the `@Beta` annotation. Alternatively, if the `@Beta` status is still relevant, I would retain it.

If you can provide more context or clarification on the intent behind the changes in either branch, I can assist in proposing a resolved version. For now, the snippet is returned with the conflict markers intact as provided.
