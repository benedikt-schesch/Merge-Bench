I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as provided since the intent of the changes is ambiguous based on the given context. The conflict appears to involve the inclusion or removal of `Collection` and `HashMap` imports from the `HEAD` branch, while the other branch (`d2c4b48a67b5a53af33a9e7c46d442403328efea`) does not show additional imports in the conflict section. Without further context about the usage of these imports in the codebase or the broader intent of each branch, it's unclear whether these imports should be retained or removed.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, maintaining the exact spacing and context as provided:
