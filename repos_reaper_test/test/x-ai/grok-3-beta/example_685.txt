Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, followed by my analysis and resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Preserved as Provided)

					+ "###############################################################################"
			);

			publishWarningMessage(title, text);
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

Let's break down the intent of both sides of the merge conflict to understand what each version is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (Left Side of Conflict)**:
  - The message uses the terminology "resource access permissions or node ownership."
  - The explanation of the issue is phrased as "missing permissions/ownerships."
  - The list of missing principals is formatted using `String.join(", ", missingPrincipals)`, which likely results in a comma-separated list of principals on a single line.
  - **Intent**: Provide a clear warning about missing permissions or ownerships with a simple, concise list of missing principals.

- **83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965 (Right Side of Conflict)**:
  - The message uses slightly different terminology: "grants or node ownership."
  - The explanation of the issue is phrased as "missing grants/ownerships" and includes an exclamation mark for emphasis ("not identical to the export you just imported!").
  - The list of missing principals is formatted using `missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))`, which sorts the list alphabetically and formats it with each principal on a new line (indented with a tab).
  - **Intent**: Provide a more detailed or emphatic warning about missing grants or ownerships, with a more readable, sorted, and line-separated list of principals for better clarity.

**Common Intent**: Both sides aim to log a warning message about missing user(s) and/or group(s) that affect node access rights during deployment. The message is meant to inform the user about discrepancies between the imported data and the current state, suggesting a configuration file update as a remedy.

**Differences**:
- Terminology: "resource access permissions" (HEAD) vs. "grants" (Right Side). "Grants" might be a more specific or updated term in the context of the codebase.
- Emphasis: The right side adds an exclamation mark for emphasis.
- Formatting of the principal list: HEAD uses a simple comma-separated list, while the right side sorts and formats the list with newlines for better readability.

### Resolution Rationale

Given the above analysis, I believe the right side (commit `83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965`) provides a more polished version of the message with improved readability (sorted list with newlines) and possibly more accurate or updated terminology ("grants"). The emphasis with the exclamation mark also aligns with the intent of making the warning more noticeable. Since readability and clarity are crucial for log messages (especially warnings), I lean toward adopting the right side's changes.

Additionally, the right side's use of `stream().sorted()` suggests an intent to ensure consistent ordering of the principals, which is a subtle but valuable improvement for debugging or comparison purposes.

### Resolved Code Snippet

Here is the resolved version of the code snippet, adopting the right side's changes while ensuring the surrounding context remains unchanged:

```java
					+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf\">pre-data-deploy.conf</a> and re-importing.";

			logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
					+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
					+ "\tThe following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of these missing grants/ownerships, node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported!\n\n"
					+ "\t" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
					+ "\n\n\tConsider adding these principals to your 'pre-data-deploy.conf' (see https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf) and re-importing.\n"
					+ "###############################################################################"
			);

			publishWarningMessage(title, text);
```

### Conclusion

I resolved the conflict by choosing the right side's version due to its improved readability (sorted, line-separated list), slightly more emphatic tone (exclamation mark), and potentially more accurate terminology ("grants"). If there is a specific reason to prefer "resource access permissions" over "grants" (e.g., established terminology in the project), or if the formatting of the list should remain compact, this resolution can be revisited. However, based on the provided snippet and semantic intent, this resolution aligns with the apparent goals of clarity and user-friendliness in logging.
