Below, I’m providing the code snippet with the surrounding context exactly as given, preserving all spacing and content. Following that, I’ll explain my analysis of the merge conflict and propose a resolution based on the semantic intent of both sides.

### Code Snippet with Context (Unchanged)

```java

  protected LongAssert(Long actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, LongAssert.class, description);
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected){
=======
  public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Analysis and Resolution Reasoning

The merge conflict here is minor and revolves around a formatting difference in the method signature of `isEqualTo`. Let's break down the intent from both sides:

- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The method signature is written as `public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected){` without a space between `expected)` and `{`. This appears to be a stylistic or formatting choice, or possibly a typo/oversight.
- **Other Branch (Right Side, commit `61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7`)**: The method signature is written as `public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected) {` with a space between `expected)` and `{`. This aligns with more conventional Java coding style guidelines (e.g., Oracle’s Java Code Conventions or common practices in many projects), which typically include a space before the opening brace for better readability.

**Semantic Intent**: Both sides are functionally identical; the difference is purely stylistic. There is no difference in behavior or logic—both define the same method with the same parameters, body, and return type. The intent of the method is to assert that the actual `Long` value is equal to an expected `long` value and return the current `LongAssert` instance for method chaining (as is common in assertion libraries like AssertJ).

**Resolution**: Since the difference is stylistic, the resolution should favor readability and consistency with common Java coding conventions. Adding a space between `expected)` and `{` improves readability and aligns with widely accepted Java style guidelines. Therefore, I will adopt the formatting from the right side (`61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7`).

Additionally, I note the trailing `<<<<<<< HEAD` marker at the end of the snippet without a corresponding `=======` or `>>>>>>>`. This appears to be an incomplete conflict marker, possibly due to truncation or an error in the snippet provided. Since it does not affect the actual conflict in the method signature and the snippet is to be returned as-is for context, I will preserve it. However, in the resolved version, I will assume it is irrelevant to the conflict resolution.

### Resolved Code Snippet

```java

  protected LongAssert(Long actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, LongAssert.class, description);
  }

  public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected) {
    longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD

```

This resolution maintains the functionality and intent of both sides while adopting the more conventional formatting for readability. If there is a specific style guide for the project that dictates no space before the opening brace, the HEAD version could be preferred, but without that context, I’ve chosen the more standard approach.
