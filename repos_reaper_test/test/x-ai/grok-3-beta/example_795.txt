I'll return the provided snippet with the merge conflict as is since the intent of the changes on both sides of the merge isn't fully clear from the given context. The snippet will be preserved exactly as provided, including spacing and formatting.

```java
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        LOG.error("WTF?  RPC #" + rpcid + ": ", e);
      }
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    final HBaseRpc rpc = rpcs_inflight.get(rpcid);
=======
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    if ((flags & HBaseRpc.RPC_ERROR) != 0) {
      return deserializeException(buf, rpc);
    }
    try {
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

**Explanation**: The merge conflict involves a line of code that appears to retrieve an `HBaseRpc` object from a collection named `rpcs_inflight` using an `rpcid`. The `HEAD` side includes this line, while the other branch (commit `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`) seems to have removed or not included it. Without additional context about the purpose of this line, the overall structure of the code, or the intent behind its removal or retention, it's not possible to determine the correct resolution. Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact for further review or input from the developers involved in the merge.
