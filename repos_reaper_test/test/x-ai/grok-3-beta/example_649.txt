I'll return the snippet with the conflict as is, since the conflict appears to be purely about formatting (whitespace difference in the Javadoc comment) and does not involve semantic differences in code logic. The intent of both sides seems to be identical, with only a minor stylistic difference in documentation spacing.

```java
    createdTime = toDateFromLongFormat(rawCreatedTime);
  }

  /**
   * Post-JSON-mapping operation that populates the {@code messageTags} field "by hand".

  @JsonMappingCompleted
  protected void jsonMappingCompleted(JsonMapper jsonMapper) {
