I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet as requested. After reviewing the code, I can see that the conflict is about whether to include the `Iterator` import statement. Let's look at the intent:

- The `HEAD` side does not include the `import java.util.Iterator;` statement.
- The other side (commit `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) explicitly adds this import.

Semantically, including the `Iterator` import suggests that there is likely code elsewhere in the file (not visible in the snippet) that requires the use of `Iterator`. Removing it might cause compilation errors if `Iterator` is indeed used. On the other hand, if it's not used, keeping the import is harmless as modern IDEs and compilers ignore unused imports.

Since the intent of the branch adding the import is likely based on a need for `Iterator` in the codebase, I will resolve the conflict by including the import to prevent potential issues.

Here is the resolved code snippet with full context preserved exactly as provided:

```java
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
import com.restfb.util.DateUtils;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;

import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;
```

This resolution assumes that the `Iterator` import was added intentionally to support code that depends on it. If this assumption is incorrect and `Iterator` is not used, it can still be safely removed during code cleanup without functional impact.
