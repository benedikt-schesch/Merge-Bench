I'm returning the provided code snippet in markdown syntax as requested, without modifying the context or spacing. After analyzing the merge conflict, I can see that there is no actual conflicting code content between the two branches (`HEAD` and `fe1b8ab28f6b9e6d70825a39c04c0384351cd5a8`). The conflict markers appear to indicate empty changes or potentially whitespace differences. Since there is no semantic difference or conflicting intent to resolve (both sides appear to have no additional code in this section), I will preserve the snippet as is with the conflict markers intact for further review or manual resolution if needed.

```java
			jp.setCodec(mapper);
			final JsonNode ret = jp.readValueAs(JsonNode.class);
			Log.v("Connection", "Command " + command + ": " + data.toString());
			Log.v("Connection", ret.toString());
			return ret;
