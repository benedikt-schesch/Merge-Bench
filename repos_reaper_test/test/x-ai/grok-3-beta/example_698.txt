I'll return the snippet as is with the merge conflict, as the intent behind the changes is ambiguous without additional context. The conflict involves the addition of `private URLSpan[] mVoteTargetSpans = null;` in one branch, which is not present in the other. It's unclear whether this field is necessary for the functionality intended by either branch or if it could potentially break existing code by being included or excluded. Therefore, I will preserve the conflict markers for manual resolution.

```java
    private int mNumVisibleComments;

    // UI State
    private View mVoteTargetView = null;
    private CommentInfo mVoteTargetCommentInfo = null;
<<<<<<< HEAD

    private URLSpan[] mVoteTargetSpans = null;

    // ProgressDialogs with percentage bars
    private AutoResetProgressDialog mLoadingCommentsProgress;
