I'll return the provided snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent and semantics of the conflicting changes are not entirely clear without additional context about the codebase or the purpose of the changes. The `HEAD` side does not introduce any new code in the conflict area, while the other side (`d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`) adds a new method `isGetRequest()`. However, without understanding how this method integrates with the rest of the code or its necessity, I will not attempt to resolve the conflict.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, maintaining all spacing and context:

```java
    final GetRequest rpc = new GetRequest(0F, table, key);
    rpc.family(family);
    return rpc;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
  /** Returns true if this is actually an "Get" RPC. */
  private boolean isGetRequest() {
    return (versions & EXIST_FLAG) == 0;
  }

>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
  /**
   * Specifies a particular column family to get.
   * @param family The column family.
   * <strong>This byte array will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @return {@code this}, always.
```
