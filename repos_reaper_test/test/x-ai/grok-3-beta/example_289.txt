Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and spacing, formatted in markdown code syntax. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge but found that the intent of the changes in the conflicting section is not entirely clear without additional context about the overall purpose of the code or the specific functionality being modified. Therefore, I am returning the snippet unchanged with the conflict markers intact for further clarification or manual resolution.

```java
                if (bagType != null && bagType.equalsIgnoreCase("default")) {
                    useDefaultBag = true;
                }
            }
        }
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
        int numInputs = pkgr.getNumInputs(keyWritable.getIndex());
        boolean[] readOnce = new boolean[numInputs];
        for (int i = 0; i < numInputs; i++)
            readOnce[i] = false;

>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a
        if (isInputAttached()) {
            // Create numInputs bags
            DataBag[] dbs = null;
            dbs = new DataBag[numInputs];
```

**Analysis of Intent and Semantics:**
- **HEAD Side**: The `HEAD` side of the conflict appears to be empty or unchanged in this snippet (no code is shown between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`), suggesting that this branch either removed code or did not introduce changes in this specific section.
- **Incoming Change (88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a)**: The incoming branch introduces logic to initialize a `numInputs` value based on `pkgr.getNumInputs(keyWritable.getIndex())`, and creates a boolean array `readOnce` to track whether inputs have been read, initializing all values to `false`.
- **Potential Intent**: The incoming change likely aims to add functionality for tracking input reads, possibly as part of handling multiple inputs in a data processing pipeline. However, without knowing the broader context (e.g., what `pkgr`, `keyWritable`, or `readOnce` are used for downstream), itâ€™s unclear if this change should be merged as is, or if it conflicts semantically with something on the `HEAD` side that might have been intentionally omitted or modified elsewhere.

Since the intent and necessity of the `readOnce` tracking logic cannot be fully determined from this snippet alone, and there might be dependencies or side effects not visible here, I have chosen to preserve the conflict markers for further review by someone with more context about the codebase or merge history. If additional information is provided, I can assist in proposing a resolution.
