          }

          return "";
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
The merge conflict arises from two different approaches to checking whether a JSON value is an empty array. Let's break down the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (left side)**: The code uses a method `isArray()` to check if `rawValue` is an array, and then uses `asArray().size()` to determine if the array is empty. This suggests a more generic or abstracted API for working with JSON values, possibly using a library or custom implementation where `rawValue` can be converted to an array type with `asArray()` and queried for its size.
- **a17acec0655b (right side)**: The code uses `instanceof JsonArray` to explicitly check if `rawValue` is of type `JsonArray`, and then casts it to `JsonArray` to check the length using `length()`. This indicates a more specific or concrete implementation, likely tied to a specific JSON library (e.g., Gson or Jackson) where `JsonArray` is a known type with a `length()` method.

**Semantic Intent**: Both sides aim to achieve the same goalâ€”identify if the `rawValue` is an empty JSON array and, if so, coerce it to an empty string while logging the action. The difference lies in the API or library being used to handle JSON values, which affects how the type checking and size/length retrieval are performed.

### Resolution
Since the intent is functionally identical, the resolution depends on understanding the correct JSON library or API in use in the project. Without additional context about the surrounding codebase (e.g., whether `rawValue` is expected to be a `JsonArray` from a specific library or a more generic type with methods like `isArray()`), I will propose a resolution that favors the more explicit type checking from the right side (`instanceof JsonArray`) as it is safer and avoids potential runtime issues if `asArray()` throws an exception or is unsupported. However, I acknowledge that this choice may need to be revisited based on the actual library or codebase context.

Here is the resolved code snippet, maintaining the original formatting and context:

```java
       * error ourselves.
       *
       * Per Antonello Naccarato, sometimes FB will return an empty JSON array instead of an empty string. Look for that
       * here.
       */
      if (rawValue instanceof JsonArray) {
        if (((JsonArray) rawValue).length() == 0) {
          if (MAPPER_LOGGER.isTraceEnabled()) {
            MAPPER_LOGGER.trace(format("Coercing an empty JSON array to an empty string for %s", fieldWithAnnotation));
          }

          return "";
```

### Note
If the project's JSON handling API does not use `JsonArray` or if `isArray()` and `asArray()` are the correct methods for this context, the `HEAD` version should be adopted instead. If further context or clarification is available (e.g., the library in use or type of `rawValue`), I can adjust the resolution accordingly. For now, I have resolved in favor of explicit type checking to minimize potential runtime errors.
