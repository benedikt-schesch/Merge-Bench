Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict, and I will provide my reasoning below the snippet before proposing a resolution.

```java
	
	private final UriTemplate authorizeUrl;
	
	private final String accessTokenUrl;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	public AccountProviderParameters(String name, String displayName, String apiKey, String secret, Long appId,
			String requestTokenUrl, String authorizeUrl, String callbackUrl, String accessTokenUrl) {
=======
	public AccountProviderParameters(String name, String apiKey, String secret, Long appId, String requestTokenUrl, String authorizeUrl, String accessTokenUrl) {
>>>>>>> 228af53d8db4ea1b58282f203bd404a3d011b7a8
		this.name = name;
		this.displayName = displayName;
		this.apiKey = apiKey;
		this.secret = secret;
		this.appId = appId;

```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The constructor includes parameters for `displayName` and `callbackUrl` in addition to the other parameters (`name`, `apiKey`, `secret`, `appId`, `requestTokenUrl`, `authorizeUrl`, and `accessTokenUrl`). The intent here seems to be providing a more detailed or extended configuration for the `AccountProviderParameters` class by including a human-readable `displayName` and a `callbackUrl` for authentication or redirection purposes.

- **Branch 228af53d8db4ea1b58282f203bd404a3d011b7a8 (Right Side)**: The constructor omits `displayName` and `callbackUrl`, sticking to a more minimal set of parameters (`name`, `apiKey`, `secret`, `appId`, `requestTokenUrl`, `authorizeUrl`, and `accessTokenUrl`). The intent appears to be keeping the constructor simple, possibly because `displayName` and `callbackUrl` are either not needed or are handled differently (e.g., derived or set elsewhere).

- **Semantic Conflict**: The conflict arises from differing views on what parameters are necessary for initializing an `AccountProviderParameters` object. The HEAD side wants additional flexibility or customization, while the other branch prioritizes simplicity or a different design where the omitted parameters might not be relevant.

### Resolution Proposal

Since the intent of HEAD seems to be providing more customization options, and the branch `228af53d8db4ea1b58282f203bd404a3d011b7a8` does not explicitly reject these additional parameters (it simply omits them, which could be due to an earlier version or a different design choice), I propose adopting the HEAD version to preserve the additional flexibility offered by `displayName` and `callbackUrl`. However, looking at the constructor body below the conflict, it appears `displayName` is assigned but there is no assignment for `callbackUrl`, which might indicate that `callbackUrl` is not yet fully integrated or used. Despite this, since the parameter is included in HEAD, it might be intended for future use or is used elsewhere in the codebase.

Below is the resolved snippet adopting the HEAD version:

```java
	
	private final UriTemplate authorizeUrl;
	
	private final String accessTokenUrl;

	public AccountProviderParameters(String name, String displayName, String apiKey, String secret, Long appId,
			String requestTokenUrl, String authorizeUrl, String callbackUrl, String accessTokenUrl) {
		this.name = name;
		this.displayName = displayName;
		this.apiKey = apiKey;
		this.secret = secret;
		this.appId = appId;

```

### Final Note

If there is uncertainty about whether `callbackUrl` should be included (e.g., if it is not used anywhere in the codebase or if the other branch's omission is intentional due to a design decision), the team should confirm the intent. If `displayName` and `callbackUrl` are critical for functionality in HEAD, this resolution aligns with that intent. If the simplicity of the right side is preferred or if `callbackUrl` is indeed unnecessary, the resolution could be revisited to align with the right side's version. For now, I lean toward preserving the additional parameters from HEAD to avoid potential loss of functionality.
