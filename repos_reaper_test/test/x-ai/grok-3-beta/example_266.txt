I'll return the snippet with the conflict resolved based on the semantic intent of both sides. The `HEAD` version includes a `serialVersionUID` field which is important for serialization in Java, while the other branch (`88ae4a5`) does not include it but has a slightly different comment formatting. Since the intent of both sides seems to be maintaining the `mBags` field with a descriptive comment, and the `serialVersionUID` is a standard practice for serializable classes (which `Packager` likely is), I will include it from the `HEAD` version.

Here is the resolved snippet with full context preserved in markdown code syntax:

```java
 * it does not use the index in the NullableTuple to find the bag to put a
 * tuple in.  Instead, the inputs are put in a bag corresponding to their
 * offset in the tuple.
 */
public class CombinerPackager extends Packager {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    private boolean[] mBags; // For each field, indicates whether or not it
                             // needs to be put in a bag.

    private Map<Integer, Integer> keyLookup;

    private int numBags;
```
