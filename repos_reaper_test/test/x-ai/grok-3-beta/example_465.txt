I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent and semantics of the changes on both sides are ambiguous without additional context about the overall purpose of the code and the specific requirements of the method. Here's the full snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
        return new AggregateResult(context).withSuffix(suffix);
    }

    @Nonnull
    @Override
<<<<<<< HEAD
    public MetricResult measureUser(TestUser user, ResultList recs, Context context) {
        LongSet good = goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, context.recommender, user);
=======
    public MetricResult measureUser(TestUser user, int targetLength, ResultList recs, Context context) {
        LongSet good = goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, user);
>>>>>>> ae1b395ec63b1333c717fdac150e0860cf0326e0
        if (good.isEmpty()) {
            logger.warn("no good items for user {}", user.getUserId());
            return new UserResult(0, false);
        }
```

**Explanation for not resolving the conflict:**
- **HEAD side**: The method signature is `measureUser(TestUser user, ResultList recs, Context context)`, and it calls `goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, context.recommender, user)`. This suggests the intent is to select items based on a recommender system within a given context.
- **Other side (ae1b395e...)**: The method signature is `measureUser(TestUser user, int targetLength, ResultList recs, Context context)`, adding a `targetLength` parameter, and it calls `goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, user)`. This suggests the intent is to limit or target a specific number of items and simplify the item selection by not using a recommender.
- **Ambiguity**: It's unclear whether `targetLength` is critical to the functionality or how it should be used within the method body (since it’s not referenced in the provided snippet). Additionally, the difference in `selectItems` arguments (`context.recommender` on HEAD vs. its absence on the other side) indicates potentially different logic for item selection, but the downstream impact isn’t visible in the snippet.

Without further context about the purpose of `targetLength`, the role of `context.recommender`, or the overall design of the system, resolving this conflict would risk misinterpreting the intended behavior. If additional code or documentation is available, I can help resolve the conflict based on that information.
