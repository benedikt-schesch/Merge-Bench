I'll analyze the merge conflict to understand the intent and semantics of both sides.

**Analysis of Intent:**
- **HEAD (Left Side):** The intent appears to be setting padding for a widget container using a resource dimension (`R.dimen.widget_container_padding`). This change focuses on adjusting the visual layout or spacing of the widget.
- **d28bc96 (Right Side):** The intent is to initialize an animator (`mRootAnimator`) for the `mRootView`, likely to handle animations for the widget (given the context of alpha, scale, and visibility changes above). This is part of setting up an animation framework for the view.
- **Combined Context:** The surrounding code is setting up visual properties (alpha, scale, visibility) and seems to be preparing for an animation or view state change. Following the conflict, there is a check for `mRootAnimator` and a listener setup, which aligns with the right side's change. The padding adjustment (left side) is a separate concern related to layout styling.

**Resolution Strategy:**
The changes from both sides appear to be independent and can be combined without conflict in intent. The padding setup (HEAD) can coexist with the animator initialization (d28bc96) as they address different aspects of the widget's setup (layout vs. animation). Therefore, I'll include both changes in sequence.

Below is the provided snippet with the conflict markers preserved (as requested, I won't modify the context or spacing), followed by my resolved version of the conflicted part if applicable. Since I believe this can be resolved, I'll also provide the resolved snippet.

**Original Snippet with Conflict (Preserved as Is):**
```java
            setAlpha(0.0f);
            setScaleX(WIDGET_FADE_SCALE);
            setScaleY(WIDGET_FADE_SCALE);
            setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);

<<<<<<< HEAD

            // Set padding
            int pad = getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.widget_container_padding);
            this.setPadding(pad, pad, pad, pad);
=======
            mRootAnimator = mRootView.animate();
>>>>>>> d28bc96faf3c28942720eaef1a486d601352d2d5

            if (mRootAnimator != null) {
                mRootAnimator.setListener(new AnimatorListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onAnimationCancel(Animator arg0) {
```

**Resolved Snippet (Combining Both Intents):**
```java
            setAlpha(0.0f);
            setScaleX(WIDGET_FADE_SCALE);
            setScaleY(WIDGET_FADE_SCALE);
            setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);

            // Set padding
            int pad = getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.widget_container_padding);
            this.setPadding(pad, pad, pad, pad);

            mRootAnimator = mRootView.animate();

            if (mRootAnimator != null) {
                mRootAnimator.setListener(new AnimatorListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onAnimationCancel(Animator arg0) {
```

**Explanation of Resolution:**
I included both the padding setup from HEAD and the animator initialization from d28bc96 since they serve distinct purposes (styling/layout and animation setup, respectively). The order is preserved as in the original conflict (padding before animator setup) to maintain logical flow, though the exact order might not be critical here. If there are specific reasons in the broader codebase for one to precede the other, this resolution can be revisited. For now, this merge respects the semantics and intent of both changes.
