Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as it was given, including all context and spacing. Following the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the conflict and a suggested resolution based on the semantics and intent of both sides of the merge.

```java
  /**
   * Lock to prevent missing timer updates.
   */
  private final Object roundTimerLock = new Object();
  private final ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor globalTimer;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private final Provider<CustomCardsService> customDecksServiceProvider;
=======
  private final Provider<CardcastService> cardcastServiceProvider;
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
  private final Provider<String> uniqueIdProvider;
  private Player host;
  private BlackDeck blackDeck;
  private BlackCard blackCard;
  private WhiteDeck whiteDeck;
```

### Analysis and Resolution Reasoning
The merge conflict arises from two different field declarations for what appears to be a provider of a service related to card decks in a game context (likely a card game like Cards Against Humanity, given the presence of `BlackDeck`, `WhiteDeck`, etc.).

- **HEAD (Current Branch):** Declares `private final Provider<CustomCardsService> customDecksServiceProvider;`. The name `CustomCardsService` and the variable name `customDecksServiceProvider` suggest an intent to provide a service for custom card decks, likely user-created or tailored content.
- **Incoming Branch (5adedd2481...):** Declares `private final Provider<CardcastService> cardcastServiceProvider;`. The name `CardcastService` and the variable name `cardcastServiceProvider` suggest an intent to integrate with a specific service called "Cardcast," which is a known platform for custom card decks in card games.

### Semantic Intent
Both sides of the merge seem to aim at providing a dependency injection mechanism (via `Provider`) for a service that handles custom or external card decks. The difference lies in the specific service being referenced:
- `CustomCardsService` might be a more generic or internally developed service for handling custom decks.
- `CardcastService` likely refers to a specific third-party integration with the Cardcast platform.

Given the context of the code (a game with black and white decks), it's reasonable to assume that both services are related to managing custom card content. However, without additional context about whether the project intends to support only Cardcast, a custom implementation, or both, the resolution must account for the possibility of needing multiple services or choosing one based on project direction.

### Proposed Resolution
Since the intent of both sides is to provide a service for custom card decks, and the difference is in the naming and specific type, I suggest resolving the conflict by choosing a more generic name that could encompass either implementation or by keeping both if the project might need to support multiple providers. However, to avoid speculation and ensure correctness, I will propose a resolution that assumes the project is moving toward integrating with Cardcast (as it appears to be a specific service) while noting that this decision should be confirmed with the team or project requirements. For simplicity, I will adopt the incoming branch's change.

If the project requires both services or a more generic abstraction, a better approach would be to introduce an interface (e.g., `CustomDeckService`) that both `CustomCardsService` and `CardcastService` can implement, but this would require more code changes beyond the scope of this conflict resolution.

### Resolved Code Snippet
Here is the resolved code snippet based on the above reasoning, integrating the incoming branch's change:

```java
  /**
   * Lock to prevent missing timer updates.
   */
  private final Object roundTimerLock = new Object();
  private final ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor globalTimer;
  private final Provider<CardcastService> cardcastServiceProvider;
  private final Provider<String> uniqueIdProvider;
  private Player host;
  private BlackDeck blackDeck;
  private BlackCard blackCard;
  private WhiteDeck whiteDeck;
```

### Note
If the intent is to retain `CustomCardsService` or support both services, or if there is ambiguity about the project's direction, please confirm with the team or provide additional context. In such cases, I can adjust the resolution accordingly (e.g., by including both providers with distinct names or using an interface-based approach). For now, I have resolved it by adopting the incoming branch's change (`CardcastService`) as it seems to indicate a specific integration goal.
