I'm returning the snippet with the resolved merge conflict. In this case, the intent of both sides can be inferred clearly. The `HEAD` version does not introduce any changes in the conflicted area, while the `760cca9f756c8b759aadcc9e3b67508946d2b173` version adds a new constant `CHUNK_SIZE`. Since there is no conflicting change in `HEAD`, the new constant can be safely included without altering the existing code.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved as provided:

```java

    public static final int FALSE = 0;

    public static final int TRUE = 1;

    public static final int CHUNK_SIZE = 50;

    private static class Holder {

        private static final DatabaseHelper instance = new DatabaseHelper();

    }

```
