Below is the provided snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as I will analyze the intent and semantics of both sides before proposing a resolution. Following the snippet, I will explain my thought process and provide a resolved version if possible.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Preserved as Provided)
```java
        } catch (Exception ex)
        {
            ServerInfo def = ProxyServer.getInstance().getServers().get(user.getPendingConnection().getListener().getDefaultServer());
            if (retry && !info.equals(def))
            {
<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/net/md_5/bungee/ServerConnection.java
                return connect(user, BungeeCord.instance.config.defaultServerName, def, handshake, false);
=======
                user.sendMessage(ChatColor.RED + "Could not connect to target server, you have been moved to the default server");
                return connect(user, def, handshake, false);
>>>>>>> cae71552cdabc4cd1ce3f9736d59de4caadac434:proxy/src/main/java/net/md_5/bungee/ServerConnection.java
            } else
            {
                throw new RuntimeException("Could not connect to target server " + Util.exception(ex));
            }
        }
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

Let's break down the two sides of the merge conflict to understand the intent behind each change:

- **HEAD (Left Side)**:
  - Code: `return connect(user, BungeeCord.instance.config.defaultServerName, def, handshake, false);`
  - Intent: When a connection to the target server fails and a retry is allowed, the user is redirected to the default server using a configuration value `defaultServerName` from `BungeeCord.instance.config`. This suggests that the server name used for the connection attempt is explicitly pulled from a configuration setting.

- **cae71552 (Right Side)**:
  - Code:
    ```
    user.sendMessage(ChatColor.RED + "Could not connect to target server, you have been moved to the default server");
    return connect(user, def, handshake, false);
    ```
  - Intent: In addition to redirecting the user to the default server (using the `def` object directly), this version also sends a user-friendly message to inform the user that the connection to the target server failed and they are being moved to the default server. This focuses on improving user experience by providing feedback about the failure.

### Semantic Merge Resolution

Both sides aim to handle a failed connection by redirecting the user to a default server, but they differ in approach:
- The HEAD side emphasizes using a configuration-based server name.
- The cae71552 side prioritizes user experience by adding a notification message, though it directly uses the `def` object without referencing a config value for the server name.

The key difference in functionality is the addition of the user message in the cae71552 side, which enhances UX. The difference in how the server name is referenced (`BungeeCord.instance.config.defaultServerName` vs. `def`) might be significant depending on whether `def` is guaranteed to align with the config value. Since `def` is retrieved earlier in the code as `ProxyServer.getInstance().getServers().get(user.getPendingConnection().getListener().getDefaultServer())`, it likely represents the same default server, but using the config directly (as in HEAD) may be more explicit or safer if there are edge cases.

Given that:
- The user message adds value by improving transparency.
- The use of `def` vs. `BungeeCord.instance.config.defaultServerName` is likely semantically equivalent in this context (since `def` is based on the listener's default server, which should align with config), but Iâ€™ll lean toward `def` for consistency with the surrounding code and the right side.

I will propose a resolution that combines the intent of both: redirecting to the default server and notifying the user.

### Resolved Code Snippet
```java
        } catch (Exception ex)
        {
            ServerInfo def = ProxyServer.getInstance().getServers().get(user.getPendingConnection().getListener().getDefaultServer());
            if (retry && !info.equals(def))
            {
                user.sendMessage(ChatColor.RED + "Could not connect to target server, you have been moved to the default server");
                return connect(user, def, handshake, false);
            } else
            {
                throw new RuntimeException("Could not connect to target server " + Util.exception(ex));
            }
        }
```

### Rationale for Resolution
- **User Experience**: Included the message from the cae71552 side to inform the user about the redirection, as this improves usability and transparency.
- **Server Reference**: Retained the use of `def` as the server reference (from cae71552) for consistency with the surrounding code context. If `BungeeCord.instance.config.defaultServerName` is critical for correctness, further context about the codebase would be needed to confirm, but `def` appears to be the intended object for connection based on how it's defined.
- **Preservation of Logic**: Maintained the core logic of redirecting to the default server on failure, satisfying the intent of both sides.

If there is uncertainty about whether `def` and `BungeeCord.instance.config.defaultServerName` are equivalent, or if there are other downstream implications, I recommend consulting with the team or reviewing additional context to confirm the correct server reference. For now, this resolution prioritizes user feedback and consistency with the local variable usage.
