Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent behind the conflicting imports is ambiguous without additional context about the codebase or the specific version of Apache Pig being used. I will also provide an explanation of the potential intent and why I am not resolving the conflict at this time.

import org.apache.pig.impl.io.FileLocalizer;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.LogicalPlanBuilder;
import org.apache.pig.impl.util.JarManager;
```

### Explanation of the Conflict and Intent Analysis:
- **HEAD Side (`import org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType;`)**: This import suggests that the `ExecType` enum is being referenced from within the `PigServer` class. This could indicate that in the current branch or version, `ExecType` is a nested class or enum under `PigServer`, which might be specific to an older or different version of Apache Pig.
- **Merged Side (`import org.apache.pig.ExecType;`)**: This import suggests that `ExecType` is a top-level class or enum directly under the `org.apache.pig` package. This might reflect a newer version or a refactored structure of Apache Pig where `ExecType` has been moved or was always at the top level.

### Why the Conflict is Not Resolved:
Without additional context about the Apache Pig version being used or the surrounding code (e.g., how `ExecType` is referenced), it is not possible to determine which import is correct. Choosing the wrong import could lead to compilation errors or runtime issues due to incorrect class paths. Resolving this conflict requires:
1. Knowledge of the Apache Pig version or library being used.
2. Inspection of how `ExecType` is used in the code (e.g., is it referenced as `PigServer.ExecType` or just `ExecType`?).
3. Optionally, checking the library documentation or JAR file structure to confirm the correct path for `ExecType`.

If you can provide additional context (e.g., the Pig version, related code where `ExecType` is used, or confirmation of the library structure), I can assist in resolving the conflict. For now, the snippet is returned as-is with the conflict markers intact.
