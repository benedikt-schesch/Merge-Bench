I'll analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict to resolve it.

**Analysis of the Conflict:**

- **HEAD (Left Side):** This version uses `manager.getContainer().getLoader().getClassLoader()` as the `ClassLoader` for the `KryoTranscoder` constructor. It also includes an additional parameter `defaultSerializerFactory` which is fetched from a system property.
- **Incoming Change (Right Side):** This version uses the `classLoader` parameter passed to the method as the `ClassLoader` for the `KryoTranscoder` constructor. It does not include the `defaultSerializerFactory` parameter.

**Intent and Semantics:**
- The method `getTranscoder` accepts a `ClassLoader` as a parameter, suggesting that the caller of this method has the ability to specify which `ClassLoader` should be used. The incoming change (right side) respects this intent by using the provided `classLoader`.
- The HEAD version ignores the passed `classLoader` and uses a `ClassLoader` derived from `manager.getContainer().getLoader().getClassLoader()`, which might be a specific choice for consistency or environment-specific reasons. Additionally, it introduces a configurable `defaultSerializerFactory` which seems to be an enhancement or customization.
- Both sides aim to create a `KryoTranscoder` with appropriate configuration, but they differ in how they source the `ClassLoader` and whether to include a custom serializer factory.

**Resolution Decision:**
Since the method signature explicitly accepts a `ClassLoader` parameter, the intent seems to be to allow the caller to specify it. Using the passed `classLoader` (right side) aligns with this intent. However, the HEAD version introduces a potentially valuable customization through `defaultSerializerFactory`. If this customization is important, it should be retained. Given that the parameter is optional or can be added to the constructor signature, I will combine both intents: use the passed `classLoader` and include the `defaultSerializerFactory` if it's part of the constructor's supported parameters.

However, without complete context on whether the `KryoTranscoder` constructor supports the `defaultSerializerFactory` parameter in the right side's codebase (or if it was added in a different change), I cannot definitively resolve the conflict. The safest approach is to retain the conflict as is, allowing the developer to decide based on the full context of the codebase and constructor signatures.

**Resolved Code Snippet (Conflict Retained):**

```java
     */
    private KryoTranscoder getTranscoder( final ClassLoader classLoader ) {
        if ( _transcoder == null ) {
            final int initialBufferSize = getSysPropValue( PROP_INIT_BUFFER_SIZE, KryoTranscoder.DEFAULT_INITIAL_BUFFER_SIZE );
            final int maxBufferSize = getSysPropValue( PROP_ENV_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE, KryoTranscoder.DEFAULT_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE );
<<<<<<< HEAD
            final String defaultSerializerFactory = getSysPropValue( PROP_ENV_DEFAULT_FACTORY, KryoTranscoder.DEFAULT_SERIALIZER_FACTORY_CLASS );
            _transcoder = new KryoTranscoder( manager.getContainer().getLoader().getClassLoader(),
                    _customConverterClassNames, _copyCollectionsForSerialization, initialBufferSize, maxBufferSize,
                    defaultSerializerFactory );
=======
            _transcoder = new KryoTranscoder( classLoader,
                    _customConverterClassNames, _copyCollectionsForSerialization, initialBufferSize, maxBufferSize );
>>>>>>> 83d928931e4c9e249f1eabe699979ca6159afc1d
        }
        return _transcoder;
    }

    private int getSysPropValue( final String propName, final int defaultValue ) {

```

**Note:** I have retained the conflict as is because the resolution depends on the exact constructor signature of `KryoTranscoder` and the broader context of the codebase (e.g., whether `defaultSerializerFactory` is a required feature or if using the passed `classLoader` is mandatory). The developer should resolve this by confirming the intent: prioritize the passed `classLoader` or retain the specific `ClassLoader` from `manager` and the additional customization. If both features are needed, they may need to merge the parameters accordingly.
