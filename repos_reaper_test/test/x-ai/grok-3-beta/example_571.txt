I'm returning the provided code snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent of the changes on both sides of the merge isn't entirely clear from the given context. The `HEAD` side introduces a `JsonHelper` field, which appears to be a utility for converting JSON values, while the other side (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) seems to omit this addition, possibly indicating it was either not needed or removed intentionally. Without additional context about the overall codebase or the purpose of `JsonHelper`, it's ambiguous whether this field should be retained or excluded.

Below is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax as provided, with spacing unchanged:

```java
   * mapping failure so client code can decide how to handle the problem.
   */
  protected JsonMappingErrorHandler jsonMappingErrorHandler;

  /**
<<<<<<< HEAD
   * Helper to convert {@see JsonValue} into a given type
   */
  private JsonHelper jsonHelper = new JsonHelper();

  /**
=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
   * Creates a JSON mapper which will throw {@link com.restfb.exception.FacebookJsonMappingException} whenever an error
   * occurs when mapping JSON data to Java objects.
   */
  public DefaultJsonMapper() {
    this(new JsonMappingErrorHandler() {
```
