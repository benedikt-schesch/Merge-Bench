I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as provided, since the intent behind the two conflicting method names and return types is ambiguous without additional context about the system or the purpose of the decks (whether they are meant to represent the same concept with different naming or are entirely different entities). Below is the code snippet exactly as provided, including the full context and spacing, with the conflict preserved.

```java
  public void updateGameSettings(final GameOptions newOptions) {
    this.options.update(newOptions);
    notifyGameOptionsChanged();
  }
