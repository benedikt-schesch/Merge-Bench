I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. Below is the original snippet with the full context preserved exactly as provided, followed by my analysis and resolution.

```java
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        if (definedFunctions != null) {
            funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias);
        }
        if (funcSpec != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            className = getClassNameFromSpec(funcSpec);
        }else{
            className = getClassNameFromSpec(alias);
=======
            className = funcSpec.getClassName();
        }else{
            className = FuncSpec.getClassNameFromSpec(alias);
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        }
        return resolveClassName(className);
    }
  
    public Object instantiateFuncFromAlias(String alias) throws IOException {

```

**Analysis and Resolution:**

Let's break down the intent of both sides of the merge conflict:

- **HEAD (first branch)**: In this version, when `funcSpec` is not null, it calls `getClassNameFromSpec(funcSpec)` to get the class name. If `funcSpec` is null, it falls back to `getClassNameFromSpec(alias)`. The intent seems to be using a utility method `getClassNameFromSpec` to extract the class name from either the `funcSpec` object or the `alias` string.
- **Other branch (1488b22)**: In this version, when `funcSpec` is not null, it directly calls `funcSpec.getClassName()` to get the class name, suggesting that `funcSpec` is an object with a direct method to retrieve the class name. If `funcSpec` is null, it uses a static method `FuncSpec.getClassNameFromSpec(alias)` to get the class name from the `alias`.

**Semantic Intent Comparison:**
- Both branches aim to resolve a class name based on a `funcSpec` object or fall back to an `alias` when `funcSpec` is null.
- The key difference is in the implementation: HEAD uses a utility method `getClassNameFromSpec` for both cases, while the other branch uses a direct method on `funcSpec` and a static method on `FuncSpec` for the fallback.
- The other branch (1488b22) seems to reflect a more object-oriented design with direct access to `funcSpec.getClassName()` and a static utility in `FuncSpec`, which might be a newer or refactored version of the codebase.

**Resolution Decision:**
Since the other branch (1488b22) appears to follow a more direct and potentially updated design (calling a method on `funcSpec` rather than passing it to a utility method), I will resolve the conflict in favor of that version. However, I must note that without further context on the codebase (e.g., whether `getClassNameFromSpec` or `FuncSpec.getClassNameFromSpec` are the intended methods or if they even exist), there is some ambiguity. If this resolution is incorrect, it can be revisited.

**Resolved Code Snippet:**

```java
        if (definedFunctions != null) {
            funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias);
        }
        if (funcSpec != null) {
            className = funcSpec.getClassName();
        }else{
            className = FuncSpec.getClassNameFromSpec(alias);
        }
        return resolveClassName(className);
    }
  
    public Object instantiateFuncFromAlias(String alias) throws IOException {

```

**Note:** If the exact method names or class structure (`FuncSpec`, `getClassNameFromSpec`, etc.) are not aligned with the current codebase, or if there is a specific reason to prefer the HEAD branch's utility method approach, please provide additional context for further clarification.
