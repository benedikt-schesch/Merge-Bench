I will analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and return it with the conflict unresolved, as the intent behind the changes on both sides is ambiguous without additional context. Below is the snippet reproduced exactly as provided, including the full context and spacing.

```java
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(OgnlFacade.class, OgnlFacade.class);
        } else {
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(ParametersProvider.class, IogiParametersProvider.class);
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(ParameterNamesProvider.class, VRaptorParameterNamesProvider.class);
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(InstantiatorWithErrors.class, VRaptorInstantiator.class);
<<<<<<< HEAD
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(Instantiator.class, VRaptorInstantiator.class);
=======
>>>>>>> 0b417b6a09b0560e1dbb221d37310d67f7f56fcb
        }

        return Collections.unmodifiableMap(REQUEST_COMPONENTS);
    }


```

**Analysis of Intent and Semantics:**
- On the `HEAD` side, there is an explicit addition of a mapping for `Instantiator.class` to `VRaptorInstantiator.class` in the `REQUEST_COMPONENTS` map.
- On the other side (commit `0b417b6a09b0560e1dbb221d37310d67f7f56fcb`), there is no content between the conflict markers, which could imply that the line was removed or never existed in that branch.
- **Ambiguity in Intent:** It is unclear whether the removal (or absence) of this mapping on the other side was intentional (e.g., to avoid redundancy or because `Instantiator` is no longer needed) or if it was an oversight. Additionally, without further context about the purpose of `Instantiator` and `VRaptorInstantiator`, I cannot confidently decide whether this mapping should be retained or discarded.
- Since the semantics and intent of both sides are not fully clear, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact for further manual resolution by someone with domain knowledge of the codebase.

If additional context or commit messages are available to clarify the purpose of adding or removing this mapping, I can revisit the resolution. For now, the conflict remains as is.
