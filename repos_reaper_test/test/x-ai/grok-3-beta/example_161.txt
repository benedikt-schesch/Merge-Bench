Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I have not modified the content since the intent of both sides of the merge is unclear. The `HEAD` side appears empty, while the other side (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) also appears empty in the provided snippet, and without additional context or code changes on either side, it is ambiguous what the intended resolution should be. Below is the snippet in markdown code syntax:

If you can provide additional context or clarify the intent of the changes on either side of the merge, I would be happy to assist in resolving the conflict. For now, the snippet is returned unchanged due to ambiguity in intent.
