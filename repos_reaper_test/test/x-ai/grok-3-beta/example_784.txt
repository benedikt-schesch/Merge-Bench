I'll resolve the merge conflict by analyzing the intent and semantics of both changes.

**Analysis:**
- On the `HEAD` side, the constant `MAX_BYTE_ARRAY_MASK` is defined with a value of `0xFFFFFFFFE0000000L`, which corresponds to a maximum array size of 512MB. The visibility is `private`, suggesting a more restricted access level.
- On the other branch (`d543609...`), the same constant is defined with a value of `0xFFFFFFFFF0000000L`, which corresponds to a maximum array size of 256MB. The visibility is package-private (default, since no modifier is specified), and the constant is not marked as `private`.
- **Intent:** Both sides are trying to set a safety limit on the maximum size of a byte array to prevent memory issues due to corrupted RPCs. The difference lies in the chosen maximum size (512MB vs. 256MB) and the visibility of the constant (`private` vs. package-private).
- **Resolution Strategy:** Since the comment in the context mentions protecting against memory allocation issues, a more conservative limit (256MB) seems safer. Additionally, the lack of `private` visibility on the branch side might be intentional to allow access within the package if needed. Iâ€™ll go with the branch side's value (256MB) and visibility (package-private) as it appears to be a deliberate choice for safety and access.

**Resolved Code Snippet:**

```java
   * undetected corruption of an RPC on the network, which would turn a
   * an innocuous RPC into something allocating a ton of memory.
   * The Hadoop RPC protocol doesn't do any checksumming as they probably
   * assumed that TCP checksums would be sufficient (they're not).
