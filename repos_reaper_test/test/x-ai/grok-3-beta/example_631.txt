I'll analyze the merge conflict based on the provided snippet and resolve it based on the semantic intent of both changes.

**Analysis of Intent:**
- The conflict is in the JavaDoc comment for a method or field related to a user's picture.
- The `HEAD` version describes the return value as "the user's picture as ProfilePictureSource object," suggesting a specific type or class named `ProfilePictureSource` is used to represent the picture.
- The `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` version describes it more generically as "the user's picture as picture object," implying a simpler or different naming convention for the type.
- Semantically, both sides are trying to document the return type of the user's picture, but `HEAD` seems to be more specific about the class/type name, which might reflect an update or refinement in the codebase to use `ProfilePictureSource`.
- Since `HEAD` is likely the more recent or intended change (as it’s the default branch or current working state), and given the specificity of the type name, it’s reasonable to prioritize `HEAD` unless there’s evidence otherwise in the broader codebase (which isn’t provided here).

**Resolution:**
I will resolve the conflict by adopting the `HEAD` version, as it provides a more precise type description, which is typically preferred in documentation for clarity and maintainability.

Here is the snippet with the resolved conflict, maintaining all context and spacing as provided:

```java
   * The user's picture, if provided.
   * 
   * To force Facebook to fill the <code>picture</code> field you have to fetch the user with the
   * <code>fields=picture</code> parameter, otherwise the picture is <code>null</code>.
   * 
   * @return the user's picture as ProfilePictureSource object
   * @since 1.6.16
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
