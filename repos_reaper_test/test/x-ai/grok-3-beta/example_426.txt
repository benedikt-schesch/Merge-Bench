I'll analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict to provide a resolution. Below is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, presented in markdown code syntax with the exact spacing and context as provided. Following that, I'll explain my reasoning and propose a resolution.

```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **HEAD Side**: The imports include `com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.R`, `NetworkSearchTask`, and `NetworkSearchTask.OnSharesFoundListener`. This suggests that the code in this branch is likely dealing with functionality related to network searching and possibly resource handling (via `R`). The intent appears to be focused on integrating network search capabilities or listeners for shares found in a network context.
  
- **Incoming Side (971b9954)**: The import is for `android.app.Activity`. This indicates that the code in this branch might be related to Android's `Activity` class, which could be used for broader context or lifecycle management in an Android application. The intent here seems to be about ensuring access to an `Activity` context, possibly for launching dialogs or managing UI interactions.

- **Common Ground**: The surrounding context after the conflict includes imports related to dialogs (`Dialog`, `DialogFragment`, `DialogInterface`) and Android basics (`Bundle`, `TextUtils`). This strongly suggests that the file is part of a `DialogFragment` implementation. Both sides of the merge might be working within this context, but with different dependencies or focuses (network search vs. activity context).

- **Ambiguity**: It is unclear whether the imports from both sides are mutually exclusive or if they are complementary. The HEAD side focuses on custom app-specific functionality (network search), while the incoming side focuses on a fundamental Android component (`Activity`). Given that `Activity` might be necessary for a `DialogFragment` to function (e.g., to access the hosting activity), and the network search functionality might be specific to this fragment's purpose, it seems likely that both sets of imports are needed.

### Resolution Proposal

Since the intents are not conflicting and both sets of imports can coexist without semantic contradiction, I propose combining the imports from both sides. My reasoning is that:
1. The `Activity` import is likely needed for the `DialogFragment` to interact with its hosting activity.
2. The network search-related imports are likely specific to the functionality of this fragment and are thus also necessary.
3. There is no overlap or conflict between these imports that would suggest one should override the other.

Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict markers removed and imports combined:

import android.app.Activity;
import android.app.Dialog;
import android.app.DialogFragment;
import android.content.DialogInterface;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.text.TextUtils;
```

### Final Note

If there is a specific reason in the broader codebase that one set of imports should not be included (e.g., `Activity` is not used or network search functionality has been deprecated), this resolution may need adjustment. However, based on the provided snippet alone and the semantic intent inferred, combining the imports appears to be the most appropriate resolution to preserve the functionality intended by both branches.
