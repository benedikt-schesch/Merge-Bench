I'll resolve the merge conflict by analyzing the intent and semantics of both sides.

The conflict is in the `deserializeObject` method call, specifically regarding the number of parameters passed to it. Let's consider the intent:

- **HEAD**: The code includes `rpcid` as an additional parameter in `deserializeObject(buf, rpcid, rpc)`, suggesting that during deserialization, identifying the specific RPC via `rpcid` is important.
- **Incoming branch (d543609...)**: The code simplifies the call to `deserializeObject(buf, rpc)`, omitting `rpcid`, which might mean the deserialization process no longer requires the `rpcid` or it is handled differently in this branch.

**Resolution**: Since including `rpcid` provides more context for deserialization (potentially for debugging or specific handling per RPC), and assuming that the method signature in HEAD supports this parameter without breaking compatibility, I'll retain the `rpcid` parameter as per the HEAD version. This preserves the intent of having specific RPC identification during deserialization, which seems safer and more detailed.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved as provided:

```java
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    if ((flags & HBaseRpc.RPC_ERROR) != 0) {
      return deserializeException(buf, rpc);
    }
    try {
      return deserializeObject(buf, rpcid, rpc);
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {  // The RPC didn't look good to us.
      return new InvalidResponseException(e.getMessage(), e);
    }
  }
```

**Note**: If the method signature of `deserializeObject` in the merged codebase no longer accepts `rpcid`, this resolution would need to be revisited, possibly requiring alignment with the updated signature or a different approach to maintain compatibility. For now, based on the provided snippet, the intent to include `rpcid` is retained.
