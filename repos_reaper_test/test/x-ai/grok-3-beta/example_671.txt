Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as provided, followed by my analysis of the intent and semantics behind both sides of the merge. I will then propose a resolution based on the inferred intent.

```java
import static com.google.common.base.Strings.isNullOrEmpty;
import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Ordering.natural;
import static com.spotify.docker.Utils.parseImageName;

import static java.util.Collections.emptyList;

/**

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The import statement `import static com.spotify.docker.Utils.pushImageTag;` suggests that the intent is to include a utility method for pushing a specific image tag to a Docker registry. This implies functionality related to tagging and pushing Docker images with specific tags.
- **7e96d6fbfb135715980af0b3ab285affc824af77 (Right Side)**: The import statement `import static com.spotify.docker.Utils.writeImageInfoFile;` suggests the intent is to include a utility method for writing information about a Docker image to a file. This likely pertains to storing or logging metadata or details about the image for later reference or processing.

### Potential Conflict and Ambiguity

- **Intent Ambiguity**: The two imported methods (`pushImageTag` and `writeImageInfoFile`) serve different purposes. One focuses on Docker image operations (pushing tags), while the other focuses on file operations (writing image metadata). Without additional context about the broader codebase or the specific functionality being developed in this file, it's unclear whether one method should take precedence over the other or if both are necessary.
- **Possible Overlap**: It's possible that both operations are part of a larger workflow (e.g., writing metadata before or after pushing a tagged image), in which case both imports could be required.
- **Risk of Exclusion**: Choosing one over the other risks losing functionality intended by the other branch. Since the imports are not inherently conflicting (they don't overlap in functionality), removing one might break code that depends on it.

### Proposed Resolution

Since the imports do not directly conflict semantically (they address distinct functionalities), and in the absence of additional context to suggest exclusivity, the safest and most inclusive resolution is to retain both imports. This ensures that neither branch's intended functionality is lost. If only one is needed, further context or discussion with the team would be required to confirm.

Here is the resolved snippet with both imports included:

```java
import static com.google.common.base.Strings.isNullOrEmpty;
import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Ordering.natural;
import static com.spotify.docker.Utils.parseImageName;
import static com.spotify.docker.Utils.pushImage;
import static com.spotify.docker.Utils.pushImageTag;
import static com.spotify.docker.Utils.writeImageInfoFile;
import static com.typesafe.config.ConfigRenderOptions.concise;
import static java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8;
import static java.util.Collections.emptyList;

/**
```

### Final Note

If there is additional context in the codebase (e.g., the class or method implementations that follow these imports) indicating that only one of these methods is relevant, or if there are performance or dependency concerns with including both, I recommend revisiting this resolution with the involved developers or by examining the usage of these methods in the code. For now, including both imports preserves the intent of both branches.
