Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as it was given, including all context and spacing, in markdown code syntax. Following the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the conflict and a resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

```java
import android.text.TextUtils;
import android.text.TextWatcher;
import android.view.Menu;
import android.view.MenuItem;
import android.widget.Toast;
<<<<<<< HEAD

import com.afollestad.materialdialogs.MaterialDialog;

```

### Analysis and Resolution
**Intent and Semantics:**
- **HEAD (Left Side):** The HEAD side does not include any additional imports in the conflicted section. This suggests that the current branch does not require or has not introduced the `MaterialDialog` class from the `com.afollestad.materialdialogs` package. The intent appears to be maintaining the existing set of imports without adding new dependencies.
- **f8f91f1d455f6842ca57b8294f6a263ff0cde1e4 (Right Side):** The incoming change introduces a new import for `MaterialDialog` from the `com.afollestad.materialdialogs` package. The intent here is likely to add support for MaterialDialog, a library often used for displaying modern, Material Design-styled dialogs in Android applications. This suggests that the branch making this change has implemented or plans to implement functionality relying on this library.

**Conflict Resolution Reasoning:**
- The conflict is purely about whether or not to include the `import com.afollestad.materialdialogs.MaterialDialog;` statement.
- Since the HEAD side does not add or modify anything in this section, it is safe to assume that its intent is to maintain the status quo (no new imports). However, the incoming branch explicitly adds a new import, indicating a deliberate intent to use the `MaterialDialog` class.
- Semantically, including the import does not harm the HEAD side's functionality (unused imports do not affect code execution in Java), while excluding it might break the incoming branch's functionality if `MaterialDialog` is used elsewhere in the codebase.
- Without additional context about whether `MaterialDialog` is actually used in the codebase, the safer and more inclusive resolution is to retain the import to avoid potential compilation errors on the incoming branch.

**Resolved Code Snippet:**
```java
import android.text.TextUtils;
import android.text.TextWatcher;
import android.view.Menu;
import android.view.MenuItem;
import android.widget.Toast;
import com.afollestad.materialdialogs.MaterialDialog;
import com.alorma.github.R;
import com.alorma.github.bean.SearchableUser;
import com.alorma.github.cache.CacheWrapper;
import com.alorma.github.emoji.Emoji;
import com.alorma.github.emoji.EmojisActivity;
```

**Note:** If there is additional context or evidence that `MaterialDialog` is not used or should not be included (e.g., project guidelines against certain dependencies), this resolution should be revisited. However, based on the provided snippet, retaining the import aligns with the semantic intent of the incoming branch while preserving compatibility with the HEAD branch.
