Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics of the two conflicting changes are not entirely clear without additional context about the variable names and their roles. I will also provide an explanation of the potential intents and why the conflict is left unresolved.

```java
  }

  @Override protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();

<<<<<<< HEAD
    qrCodeReaderView.startCamera();
=======
    if (myDecoderView != null) {
      myDecoderView.startCamera();
    }
>>>>>>> cb961dc3d5c704340d8ab747637d1c475bedc03d
  }

  @Override protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
```

**Explanation of Analysis and Decision to Preserve Conflict:**

- **Intent of HEAD (qrCodeReaderView.startCamera();):**  
  This side of the merge suggests that a camera associated with `qrCodeReaderView` should be started unconditionally when the `onResume()` method is called. The intent appears to be ensuring that the camera is always active when the activity resumes, possibly assuming `qrCodeReaderView` is a critical component for QR code scanning.

- **Intent of cb961dc3 (if (myDecoderView != null) { myDecoderView.startCamera(); }):**  
  This side of the merge introduces a null check for `myDecoderView` before attempting to start the camera. The intent here seems to be adding safety to prevent a potential `NullPointerException` if `myDecoderView` has not been initialized. It also uses a different variable name (`myDecoderView`) compared to HEAD's `qrCodeReaderView`, which raises questions about whether these refer to the same object or if there has been a refactoring or change in implementation.

- **Ambiguity and Reason for Preserving Conflict:**  
  Without additional context about the relationship between `qrCodeReaderView` and `myDecoderView` (e.g., are they the same object with a renamed variable, or are they different components?), it is impossible to determine the correct resolution. Additionally, the null check in the second version suggests a defensive programming approach, which may be necessary if the initialization of the view is not guaranteed. However, removing the null check (as in HEAD) might be intentional if the developer is certain the view is always initialized at this point. Resolving this conflict would risk misinterpreting the developer's intent, so I am leaving it as is for manual review or further clarification.

If additional context about the variable names or initialization logic is provided, I can revisit the conflict resolution. For now, the snippet is returned unchanged with the conflict markers intact.
