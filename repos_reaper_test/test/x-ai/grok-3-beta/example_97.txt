I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and resolve it based on the intent and semantics of both sides. Below is the original snippet preserved exactly as provided, followed by my analysis and resolution.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Unchanged)
```java
  public void setUp() {
    cuMock = createMock(ConnectedUsers.class);
    gmMock = createMock(GameManager.class);
    metricsMock = createMock(Metrics.class);
    game = new Game(0, cuMock, gmMock, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
<<<<<<< HEAD
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider);
=======
        formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider);
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
  }

  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  @Test
  public void testRemovePlayer() throws IllegalStateException, TooManyPlayersException {
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The constructor call for `Game` includes parameters up to `formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider`. This suggests a version of the `Game` constructor with fewer parameters, likely an older or simpler version of the codebase where additional providers or options were not yet introduced.
- **Incoming Change (Right Side - ed08e371)**: The constructor call adds two additional parameters: `falseProvider` and `gameOptionsProvider`. This indicates an updated version of the `Game` constructor that likely includes additional configuration options or providers for game settings.
- **Intent**: The incoming change seems to extend the functionality of the `Game` class by passing additional configuration or provider objects. The HEAD version lacks these additional parameters, suggesting it may be outdated or from a branch that hasn't incorporated the latest constructor signature. The intent of the incoming change is to include more customization or flexibility in the `Game` initialization, while HEAD appears to maintain a minimal or older setup.
- **Semantic Resolution**: Since the incoming change (right side) appears to be an enhancement or update to the constructor signature, and assuming the test setup (`setUp()`) should reflect the most current version of the `Game` class for proper testing, I will prioritize the incoming change. This ensures the test setup aligns with the latest codebase changes, including potential new features or configurations represented by `gameOptionsProvider`.

### Resolved Snippet
```java
  public void setUp() {
    cuMock = createMock(ConnectedUsers.class);
    gmMock = createMock(GameManager.class);
    metricsMock = createMock(Metrics.class);
    game = new Game(0, cuMock, gmMock, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
        formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider);
  }

  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  @Test
  public void testRemovePlayer() throws IllegalStateException, TooManyPlayersException {
```

### Explanation of Resolution
I resolved the conflict by adopting the incoming change from the right side (commit `ed08e371`), as it likely represents an updated constructor signature for the `Game` class with additional parameters (`falseProvider` and `gameOptionsProvider`). This choice assumes that the test setup should use the latest version of the class for compatibility with the broader codebase. If this assumption is incorrect (e.g., if the HEAD version is intentionally using a different constructor for specific test scenarios), further context about the `Game` class constructor signatures would be required. However, based on typical development practices where incoming changes often reflect updates or enhancements, this resolution prioritizes the extended parameter list.
