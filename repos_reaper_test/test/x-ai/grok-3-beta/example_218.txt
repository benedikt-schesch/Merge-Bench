Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, reproduced in markdown code syntax exactly as given, with no modifications to the context or spacing. Following that, I will provide an explanation of the semantic intent and my resolution of the conflict.

```java
    private PigServer pig;
    
    @Before
    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        pig = new PigServer(MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
    }
=======
        pig = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
    }
    
    Boolean[] nullFlags = new Boolean[] { false, true };

    @Test
    public void testAdd() throws Throwable {
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
        
```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Semantic Intent and Conflict Analysis:**
- **HEAD (Left Side):** The code uses `MAPREDUCE` as the first argument to the `PigServer` constructor. This likely refers to a constant or a variable representing the execution type for PigServer in a MapReduce mode. The intent is to initialize `PigServer` with a specific execution mode (MapReduce) and the cluster's properties.
- **Other Branch (Right Side, commit 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309):** The code uses `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` as the first argument to the `PigServer` constructor. This suggests that `ExecType` is an enum or class that defines execution types, with `MAPREDUCE` as one of the possible values. The intent is the same: to initialize `PigServer` with a MapReduce execution mode and the cluster's properties.
- **Additional Context in Right Side:** The right side also introduces a `Boolean[] nullFlags` array after the `setUp` method, which is not directly related to the conflict in the `PigServer` initialization but is part of the context provided by the merge.

**Key Observation:** The conflict arises due to a difference in how the MapReduce execution type is referenced. On the HEAD side, it is `MAPREDUCE`, while on the other branch, it is `ExecType.MAPREDUCE`. This likely indicates a refactoring or update in the codebase where the way execution types are defined or accessed has changed (e.g., moving to an enum or a more explicit namespace).

**Resolution Decision:** The semantic intent on both sides is identical: to initialize `PigServer` with a MapReduce execution mode. Given that `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` (from the right side) appears to be a more explicit and likely updated reference (possibly reflecting a newer API or codebase standardization), I will resolve the conflict by adopting `ExecType.MAPREDUCE`. Additionally, since the `Boolean[] nullFlags` array is part of the right side's changes and does not conflict with the HEAD side, it will be retained as is.

**Resolved Code Snippet:**

```java
    private PigServer pig;
    
    @Before
    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
        pig = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
    }
    
    Boolean[] nullFlags = new Boolean[] { false, true };

    @Test
    public void testAdd() throws Throwable {
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
        
```

**Note:** If there is any uncertainty about whether `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` is the correct or latest reference (e.g., if `MAPREDUCE` on the HEAD side is indeed a valid constant or if the API has changed in a way not reflected in this snippet), further context or documentation would be needed. In such a case, I would recommend consulting with the team or codebase documentation to confirm the correct usage. However, based on the provided snippet and typical naming conventions, `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` appears to be the more structured and likely intended reference.
