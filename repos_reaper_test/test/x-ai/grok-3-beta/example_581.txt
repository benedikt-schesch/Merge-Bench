Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including the full context and spacing. After the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict and propose a resolution if possible.

```java
    Date dateStart = toDateFromLongFormat(rawStartTime);
    startTime = dateStart == null ? toDateFromShortFormat(rawStartTime) : dateStart;
  }

  @JsonMappingCompleted
<<<<<<< HEAD
  protected void jsonMappingCompleted(JsonMapper jsonMapper) {
=======
  protected void jsonMappingCompleted() {
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;


```

### Analysis of Merge Conflict
- **HEAD (Left Side):** The method `jsonMappingCompleted` is defined with a parameter `JsonMapper jsonMapper`. This suggests that the intent was to allow access to the `JsonMapper` object during the mapping completion process, possibly to perform additional mapping or configuration tasks using the mapper.
- **Right Side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe):** The method `jsonMappingCompleted` is defined without any parameters. This implies that the intent was to simplify the method signature, possibly because the `JsonMapper` parameter was deemed unnecessary or unused in the method body (which is not fully visible in the provided snippet).

### Semantic Intent
- Both sides appear to be related to handling post-mapping logic as indicated by the `@JsonMappingCompleted` annotation, which likely triggers this method after JSON deserialization or mapping is complete.
- The key difference is whether the `JsonMapper` parameter is needed for the method's functionality. Since the body of the method in the provided snippet does not use the `JsonMapper` parameter (only `picture` and `rawPicture` are referenced), it seems that the parameter might not be necessary for the current implementation. However, without the full method body, it's unclear if `JsonMapper` is used later in the method.

### Proposed Resolution
Since the intent of the parameter is ambiguous without the full method body, and to avoid potential loss of functionality, I will err on the side of caution and retain the `JsonMapper` parameter from the HEAD side. This preserves the possibility that the parameter is used elsewhere in the method or might be needed for future extensions.

Below is the resolved snippet with the conflict markers removed and the HEAD version adopted:

```java
    Date dateStart = toDateFromLongFormat(rawStartTime);
    startTime = dateStart == null ? toDateFromShortFormat(rawStartTime) : dateStart;
  }

  @JsonMappingCompleted
  protected void jsonMappingCompleted(JsonMapper jsonMapper) {
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;


```

### Note
If the `JsonMapper` parameter is confirmed to be unused in the full method body, the resolution could be revised to adopt the right side's version (without the parameter). If you have access to the full method implementation or additional context, please provide it for a more definitive resolution.
