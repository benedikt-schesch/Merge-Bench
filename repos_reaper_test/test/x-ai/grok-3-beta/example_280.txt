Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and spacing. I have not modified the content in any way. After presenting the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the conflict and a potential resolution based on the intent and semantics.

```java

    private PhysicalPlan createDemuxPlan(boolean sameKeyType, boolean isCombiner)
        throws VisitorException {
        PODemux demux = getDemux(isCombiner);
        POPackage pkg = getMultiQueryPackage(sameKeyType, isCombiner);
<<<<<<< HEAD

        PhysicalPlan pl = new PhysicalPlan();
        pl.add(pkg);
        try {
            pl.addAsLeaf(demux);
        } catch (PlanException e) {

```

### Analysis of Merge Conflict
- **Context and Intent**: The method `createDemuxPlan` constructs a `PhysicalPlan` by adding a `POPackage` (`pkg`) and a `PODemux` (`demux`) as a leaf node. The code after the conflict section is consistent and focuses on building the plan.
- **Conflict Details**:
  - **HEAD**: Contains an empty line (or no content) between the conflict markers.
  - **Incoming (88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a)**: Contains a single line with extra whitespace (likely an empty line with spaces or tabs).
- **Semantic Intent**: Both sides of the merge do not introduce any functional code changes in the conflicting area. The difference appears to be purely whitespace or formatting. The intent of the method remains the same on both sides: to create and configure a `PhysicalPlan`. Therefore, the conflict does not affect the logic or behavior of the code.
- **Resolution Recommendation**: Since there is no meaningful content difference in the conflicting section, the conflict can be resolved by choosing either side (essentially ignoring the empty or whitespace-only changes). To maintain cleanliness, I suggest resolving it by removing the conflict markers and leaving a single empty line for readability (mirroring the likely intent of spacing in the original code).

### Resolved Code Snippet
Here is the resolved version of the snippet, with the conflict markers removed and a single empty line preserved for formatting consistency:

```java

    private PhysicalPlan createDemuxPlan(boolean sameKeyType, boolean isCombiner)
        throws VisitorException {
        PODemux demux = getDemux(isCombiner);
        POPackage pkg = getMultiQueryPackage(sameKeyType, isCombiner);

        PhysicalPlan pl = new PhysicalPlan();
        pl.add(pkg);
        try {
            pl.addAsLeaf(demux);
        } catch (PlanException e) {

```

### Justification
The resolution preserves the original intent and structure of the code while addressing the conflict in a way that does not alter functionality. The choice of a single empty line aligns with common Java coding style for readability between variable declarations and subsequent logic. If the team or project has specific formatting guidelines (e.g., no empty lines or multiple empty lines), the resolution can be adjusted accordingly. If there is any doubt about specific formatting rules or hidden intent not visible in the snippet, the original conflict can be retained for further discussion with the team.
