I'm returning the snippet with the merge conflict unresolved because the intent and semantics of the conflicting changes are ambiguous. On the `HEAD` side, there is a `serialVersionUID` field added for serialization purposes, which is a common practice for classes extending serializable types like `AbstractFacebookType`. On the other side (commit `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`), this field is omitted, which could indicate either an intentional removal or simply no change was made to add it. Without further context about the project's serialization requirements or coding standards, I cannot confidently resolve this conflict.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax as provided, with spacing unchanged:

```java

  }

  class DebugTokenError extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    @Facebook
    private Integer code;

    @Facebook
    private String message;

```
