I'll analyze this merge conflict snippet and resolve it based on the semantic intent of both sides.

The conflict is between:
- `final Map<GameInfo, Object> info = new HashMap<GameInfo, Object>();` (HEAD)
- `final Map<GameInfo, Object> info = new HashMap<>();` (commit 5adedd24...)

**Analysis of Intent:**
- The difference is minor and relates to the style of generics in Java. The HEAD version explicitly specifies the type parameters `<GameInfo, Object>` in the `HashMap` constructor, while the other version uses the diamond operator `<>` which infers the types from the variable declaration.
- Both achieve the same functional result since the type inference with `<>` will resolve to `HashMap<GameInfo, Object>` based on the variable declaration.
- The intent on both sides is to create a new `HashMap` to store game information with keys of type `GameInfo` and values of type `Object`.
- Using the diamond operator `<>` is a more modern and concise Java style, introduced in Java 7, and is generally preferred unless explicit type parameters are needed for clarity or compatibility.

**Resolution Decision:**
I'll resolve the conflict by adopting the more modern and concise syntax with the diamond operator `<>` as it aligns with current Java coding practices and does not alter the semantics of the code.

Here is the entire snippet with the conflict resolved, preserving all context and spacing:

```java
   *                        sent to people in the game.
   * @return This game's general information: ID, host, state, player list, etc.
   */
  @Nullable
  public Map<GameInfo, Object> getInfo(final boolean includePassword) {
    final Map<GameInfo, Object> info = new HashMap<>();
    info.put(GameInfo.ID, id);
    // This is probably happening because the game ceases to exist in the middle of getting the
    // game list. Just return nothing.
    if (null == host) {
      return null;
```
