Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given with no modifications to the context or spacing. Following the snippet, I will explain my reasoning for the resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

```java

  /** Private constructor.  */
  private PutRequest(final byte[] table,
                     final KeyValue kv,
                     final long lockid) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    super(PUT, table, kv.key(), kv.family(), kv.timestamp(), lockid);
=======
    super(table, kv.key(), kv.family(), kv.timestamp(), lockid);
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    this.qualifiers = new byte[][] { kv.qualifier() };
    this.values = new byte[][] { kv.value() };
  }

  /** Private constructor.  */

```

### Explanation of Intent and Semantics

- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The code on the HEAD side includes an additional parameter `PUT` in the `super` constructor call. This likely indicates that the intent is to specify an operation type (e.g., `PUT`) explicitly as part of the parent class constructor initialization. This could be part of a design where the operation type is a critical part of the parent class behavior or state.
- **d543609 (Right Side)**: The code on the right side omits the `PUT` parameter in the `super` constructor call. This suggests that the parent class constructor might have been refactored or simplified to not require an operation type as an argument, or it could imply that the operation type is handled differently (perhaps hardcoded or set elsewhere).

### Resolution Reasoning

The key semantic difference is the presence of the `PUT` parameter in the `super` call. To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the parent class constructor signature:
- If the parent class currently expects an operation type (like `PUT`) as the first argument in its constructor, then the HEAD side (left) is correct.
- If the parent class constructor no longer requires this parameter (perhaps after a refactor), then the right side is correct.

Without access to the parent class definition or further context about the codebase (e.g., whether `PUT` is a defined constant and whether the `super` constructor signature matches the HEAD or the right side), I cannot definitively resolve the conflict. The intent is ambiguous because both changes could be valid depending on the surrounding codebase state.

Therefore, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact, as I am not certain about the correct resolution without additional context.

If you can provide more information about the parent class constructor signature or the purpose of the `PUT` parameter, I can offer a precise resolution.
