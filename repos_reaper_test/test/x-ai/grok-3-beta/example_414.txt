I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and resolve it based on the intent and semantics of both sides. Below, I first present the original snippet with the conflict unchanged (as requested) and then provide my reasoning and resolution.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Unchanged)

```java
    @Test
    void shouldTellUserThatTemplateOptionRequiresInitOption() throws Exception {

        String[] args = {"-t", "groovy-mte"};

<<<<<<< HEAD
        assertExitWithStatus(SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR.getStatus(), ()->Main.main(args));
=======
        assertExitWithStatus(1, () -> Main.main(args));
>>>>>>> d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb

        verify(mockAppender, times(1)).doAppend(captorLoggingEvent.capture());

        LoggingEvent loggingEvent = captorLoggingEvent.getValue();
        assertThat(loggingEvent.getMessage()).isEqualTo("Error: Missing required argument(s): --init");
```

### Analysis and Reasoning

I have examined the merge conflict to understand the intent of both changes:

- **HEAD Side**: The code uses `SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR.getStatus()` as the expected exit status in the `assertExitWithStatus` method. This suggests that the codebase has an enum or class `SystemExit` that defines specific exit codes for different types of errors, with `CONFIGURATION_ERROR` representing a specific error condition (likely for configuration-related issues). The intent here seems to be to make the test more explicit and maintainable by using a named constant for the exit status, which provides semantic clarity about what kind of error is expected.
  
- **Other Side (d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb)**: The code uses a hardcoded value `1` as the expected exit status. This suggests a simpler or possibly older approach where the exit code is directly specified. The intent here might be to keep the test straightforward or to reflect a context where the exact meaning of the exit code is less critical, or perhaps the `SystemExit` enum/class wasn’t available or in use at the time of this change.

**Semantic Intent**: Both sides are testing the same behavior—that the `Main.main(args)` call should exit with a specific status when the `--init` argument is missing alongside the `-t` (template) option. The difference lies in how the exit status is represented. The `HEAD` side prioritizes readability and maintainability by using a named constant, while the other side uses a raw numeric value, which is less descriptive and more error-prone.

**Resolution Strategy**: The intent of the test is to verify that the program exits with an error status indicating a configuration issue. Using a named constant (`SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR.getStatus()`) aligns better with good coding practices as it provides clarity and reduces the risk of magic numbers leading to errors in the future. There is no loss of functionality in choosing the `HEAD` version, and it aligns with the broader semantic goal of writing maintainable and self-explanatory code. I will assume that `SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR.getStatus()` evaluates to `1` (or whatever the appropriate error code is) as per the project’s design, and thus it satisfies the intent of both sides.

If there’s a concern that the value of `SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR.getStatus()` might not be `1`, or if there’s a specific reason to use a hardcoded value (e.g., in a context where the enum isn’t available), the numeric value could be reconsidered. However, absent such context, the named constant is the better choice.

### Resolved Snippet

```java
    @Test
    void shouldTellUserThatTemplateOptionRequiresInitOption() throws Exception {

        String[] args = {"-t", "groovy-mte"};

        assertExitWithStatus(SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR.getStatus(), ()->Main.main(args));

        verify(mockAppender, times(1)).doAppend(captorLoggingEvent.capture());

        LoggingEvent loggingEvent = captorLoggingEvent.getValue();
        assertThat(loggingEvent.getMessage()).isEqualTo("Error: Missing required argument(s): --init");
```

### Conclusion

I resolved the conflict in favor of the `HEAD` side because it uses a named constant (`SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR.getStatus()`), which better captures the semantic intent of testing for a configuration error and improves code readability and maintainability. If there is additional context suggesting that the hardcoded value `1` must be used (e.g., due to a different exit code mapping or legacy reasons), this resolution can be revisited.
