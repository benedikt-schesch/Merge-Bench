I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and return it with the full context preserved in markdown code syntax. After reviewing the conflict, I notice that one side (HEAD) includes `DataAtom` while the other side (merge commit `1488b22ce3...`) does not include any import for `DataAtom`. Since the intent of both sides is not entirely clear without more context (e.g., whether `DataAtom` is needed or obsolete in the codebase), I will return the snippet as is with the conflict markers intact for further manual resolution by someone with more context about the codebase.

Here is the unchanged snippet with full context:

```java
package org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.math;

import java.io.IOException;

import org.apache.pig.EvalFunc;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.apache.pig.data.DataAtom;
=======
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.schema.Schema;
import org.apache.pig.data.DataType;

<<<<<<< HEAD

```

**Note:** I am preserving the conflict markers because the intent behind removing or keeping `DataAtom` is ambiguous. If `DataAtom` is no longer used in the codebase or has been replaced, the merge from `1488b22ce3...` might be correct in omitting it. Conversely, if `DataAtom` is still required for the functionality in `HEAD`, it should be retained. A developer familiar with the codebase should confirm whether this import is necessary.
