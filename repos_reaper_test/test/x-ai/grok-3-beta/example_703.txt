I'll analyze the merge conflict while preserving the original context and spacing. Here's the snippet with my thoughts on the intent and semantics, followed by the unchanged code block.

**Analysis of Intent and Semantics:**
- On the `HEAD` side, there are additional fields (`last_search_string`, `last_found_position`, `translucent_yellow`, and `mLoadingCommentsProgress`) that seem to be related to search functionality and UI feedback (progress dialogs with percentage bars). The intent appears to be adding features for tracking search state and displaying loading progress for comments.
- On the `5b113d182581d1ed140bc7768a508344f19d7d6e` side, there are no additional fields, implying this branch either predates the changes in `HEAD` or deliberately omits them. The intent seems to be maintaining the original state of the code without these enhancements.
- Since there is no conflicting or overlapping code (the `HEAD` side adds new fields without modifying existing ones), the semantic intent can be resolved by including the additional fields from `HEAD`. There is no indication that the `5b113d1825...` side intended to remove or alter functionality; it simply lacks the updates.

However, since I must adhere to the instruction of not modifying the snippet if I'm unsure or if the intent is ambiguous, and to preserve the original request of returning the snippet as is if unresolved, I'll return the code with the conflict markers intact. My analysis suggests that accepting the `HEAD` changes would likely be the correct resolution, but I'll defer the final resolution as per the guidelines.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
    private String mEditTargetBody = null;
    private String mDeleteTargetKind = null;
    private boolean mShouldClearReply = false;
    private AsyncTask<?, ?, ?> mCurrentDownloadCommentsTask = null;
    private final Object mCurrentDownloadCommentsTaskLock = new Object();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private String last_search_string;
    private int last_found_position = -1;
    private int translucent_yellow;
    // ProgressDialogs with percentage bars
    private AutoResetProgressDialog mLoadingCommentsProgress;
