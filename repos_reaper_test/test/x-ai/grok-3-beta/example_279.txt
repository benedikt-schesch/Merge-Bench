I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and resolve it based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

**Analysis of Intent and Semantics:**

- **Context:** The code appears to be part of a method in a data processing or optimization system (likely Apache Pig, given the `OptimizerException` and `PigException.BUG`). The surrounding code deals with adding a packager to `toPkgr`, setting a key type flag (`isSameKeyType`), and performing a validation check on `pkCount` against `total`, throwing an exception if there's an inconsistency.
- **Conflict:** The conflict is at the line after `toPkgr.setSameMapKeyType(isSameKeyType);`. The `HEAD` branch has no additional content (just a newline), while the `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a` branch also has no additional content beyond whitespace (an empty line with indentation).
- **Intent:** Both sides of the merge seem to have no functional changes in the conflicted area; it's merely a difference in whitespace or empty lines. The actual logic (calling `setSameMapKeyType` and the subsequent `if` check) remains consistent on both sides. Therefore, the intent is likely just to maintain the existing code structure without introducing new behavior in this conflicted section.

Since there is no semantic difference between the two sides of the conflict (only whitespace), I will resolve it by choosing the simplest form, which is the `HEAD` side (a newline without extra indentation), to maintain consistency with the surrounding code style.

Here is the resolved code snippet with the full context preserved as provided:

```java
            toPkgr.addPackager(cpkgr);
            pkCount = 1;
        }

        toPkgr.setSameMapKeyType(isSameKeyType);

        if (pkCount != total) {
            int errCode = 2146;
            String msg = "Internal Error. Inconsistency in key index found during optimization.";
            throw new OptimizerException(msg, errCode, PigException.BUG);
        }
```
