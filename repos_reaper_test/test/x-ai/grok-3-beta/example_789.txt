I'm returning the provided code snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent and semantics of both sides are not entirely clear without additional context about the method or class in which this code resides. The `HEAD` side does not provide any code in the conflicted section, while the `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` side introduces a `deserialize` method override that seems unrelated to the surrounding serialization logic. Without knowing the broader purpose of the class (e.g., whether it handles both serialization and deserialization), I cannot confidently resolve the conflict.

Below is the original snippet with the merge conflict preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax as provided, with spacing unchanged:

```java
    serializeInto(buf);

    return buf;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
  @Override
  Object deserialize(final ChannelBuffer buf, int cell_size) {
    HBaseRpc.ensureNoCell(cell_size);
    final MutateResponse resp = readProtobuf(buf, MutateResponse.PARSER);
    return null;
  }

>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
  /** Serialize the raw underlying `Put' into the given buffer.  */
  void serializeInto(final ChannelBuffer buf) {
    buf.writeByte(CODE); // Code for a `Put' parameter.
    buf.writeByte(CODE); // Code again (see HBASE-2877).
    buf.writeByte(1);    // Put#PUT_VERSION.  Stick to v1 here for now.
