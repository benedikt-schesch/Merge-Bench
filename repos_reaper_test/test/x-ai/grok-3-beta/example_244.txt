I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the resolved code snippet. The intent and semantics of both sides are clear: they are trying to achieve the same functionality, which is to call `MapRedUtil.getCombinePigSplits` with the provided parameters to get a list of combined splits. The difference is purely in formatting (line break and spacing).

Since the functionality is identical, I will resolve the conflict by adopting one of the formatting styles for consistency. I'll choose the style from the `HEAD` side for clarity, as it keeps the line unbroken.

Here is the resolved code snippet with full context preserved exactly as provided:

```java
        } else {
            long maxCombinedSplitSize = conf.getLong("pig.maxCombinedSplitSize", 0);
            if (maxCombinedSplitSize== 0)
                // default is the block size
                maxCombinedSplitSize = blockSize;
            List<List<InputSplit>> combinedSplits =
                MapRedUtil.getCombinePigSplits(oneInputSplits, maxCombinedSplitSize, conf);
            for (int i = 0; i < combinedSplits.size(); i++)
                pigSplits.add(createPigSplit(combinedSplits.get(i), inputIndex, targetOps, i, conf));
            return pigSplits;
        }
    }
```

This resolution maintains the original intent and behavior of the code while resolving the formatting difference introduced by the merge conflict.
