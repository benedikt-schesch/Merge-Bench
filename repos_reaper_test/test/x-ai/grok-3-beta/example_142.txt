I'll resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intent of both sides. 

**Analysis of Intent:**
- **HEAD**: The method signature uses `MiniGenericCluster` as the type for the `cluster` parameter. This suggests that the branch is working with a specific or newer version of the cluster class, possibly with additional functionality or a renamed class.
- **Branch (8923da8)**: The method signature uses `MiniCluster` as the type for the `cluster` parameter. Additionally, it includes logic to handle file paths for Windows by replacing backslashes with forward slashes, which indicates an intent to ensure cross-platform compatibility for file paths.

**Resolution Strategy:**
- The conflict appears to be about the class name (`MiniGenericCluster` vs. `MiniCluster`) and the addition of Windows-specific path normalization logic.
- Semantically, the Windows path handling logic is an enhancement that does not conflict with the intent of the method itself (copying files from a cluster to a local system). It should be retained.
- The class name difference (`MiniGenericCluster` vs. `MiniCluster`) is likely due to a rename or refactoring in one of the branches. Since I don't have additional context about which is the correct or current name, I'll prioritize the `HEAD` version (`MiniGenericCluster`) as it represents the base branch's intent, but I'll note that this might need verification with the codebase's current state.
- The resolution will keep the `HEAD` class name but incorporate the Windows path normalization logic from the branch.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved as provided:

```java
            throw new IOException(e);
        }

    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    static public void copyFromClusterToLocal(MiniGenericCluster cluster,
            String fileNameOnCluster, String localFileName) throws IOException {
=======
	static public void copyFromClusterToLocal(MiniCluster cluster, String fileNameOnCluster, String localFileName) throws IOException {
        if(Util.WINDOWS){
            fileNameOnCluster = fileNameOnCluster.replace('\\','/');
            localFileName = localFileName.replace('\\','/');
        }

RESOLVED:
    static public void copyFromClusterToLocal(MiniGenericCluster cluster, String fileNameOnCluster, String localFileName) throws IOException {
        if(Util.WINDOWS){
            fileNameOnCluster = fileNameOnCluster.replace('\\','/');
            localFileName = localFileName.replace('\\','/');
        }
	    File parent = new File(localFileName).getParentFile();
	    if (!parent.exists()) {
	        parent.mkdirs();
	    }
	    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(localFileName));
```

**Note**: I've included a "RESOLVED" section to show the merged result for clarity. However, in the final application, you would typically remove the conflict markers and keep only the resolved code. Also, please verify the correct class name (`MiniGenericCluster` vs. `MiniCluster`) based on the current codebase or project conventions, as this resolution assumes `MiniGenericCluster` from `HEAD` is the intended type. If this assumption is incorrect, the class name in the resolved code should be adjusted accordingly.
