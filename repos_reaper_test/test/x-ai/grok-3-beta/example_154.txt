I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent and semantics of the changes are not entirely clear without additional context about the codebase or the purpose of the parameter `myPig`. Below is the original snippet with the conflict markers preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax as provided:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "dump b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

<<<<<<< HEAD
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));
=======
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
>>>>>>> 2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```

### Explanation:
- The conflict involves the initialization of `GruntParser`. On the `HEAD` side, the constructor takes a single argument (`StringReader`), while on the `2125666c` branch, it takes an additional parameter (`myPig`).
- Without further context about what `myPig` represents (potentially a configuration, context, or instance of a Pig server or environment) and whether the `HEAD` branch intentionally omitted it or if `myPig` is a necessary addition, I cannot confidently resolve the conflict.
- If `myPig` is a required parameter for the current version of the library or framework being used, the branch version might be the correct one. Conversely, if `HEAD` represents a simplified or updated API, the single-argument constructor might be the intended one.
- Resolution would require additional information about the codebase, the API of `GruntParser`, or the purpose of `myPig`.

As such, Iâ€™ve preserved the original snippet with the conflict markers for further review or input from the developers involved in the merge.
