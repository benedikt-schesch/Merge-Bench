I'll analyze the merge conflict based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict

- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The constructor accepts `ConnectedUsers users` as a parameter but does not include the `gameChatEnabled` boolean parameter. This suggests that the code on this branch might not yet include or require the functionality tied to enabling/disabling game chat.
- **Incoming Change (Right Side)**: The constructor includes both `ConnectedUsers users` and an additional parameter `boolean gameChatEnabled` with an annotation `@GameChatEnabled`. This indicates an intent to introduce configuration or feature toggling for game chat functionality, likely as part of a feature or enhancement.

### Intent and Semantics
- The field `gameChatEnabled` is already declared in the class (`private final boolean gameChatEnabled;`), which suggests that the class is designed to use this field, even if it’s not yet initialized in the HEAD version.
- The right side (incoming change) is enhancing the constructor to inject the `gameChatEnabled` value, aligning with the field declaration and possibly introducing dependency injection for configuration. This change appears to complete the initialization of the class's fields.
- The left side (HEAD) might represent an older or incomplete version of the code that hasn’t yet accounted for the `gameChatEnabled` feature.
- Resolving in favor of the incoming change (right side) seems to align with the overall design intent of the class, as it ensures all fields are properly initialized via the constructor.

### Resolution
I will resolve the conflict by accepting the incoming change from the right side (`ed08e371`), as it appears to be the more complete and intended version of the constructor, ensuring all fields (`users` and `gameChatEnabled`) are initialized.

Here is the resolved code snippet with the full context preserved as provided:

```java
  private final ConnectedUsers users;
  private final boolean gameChatEnabled;

  @Inject
  public GameChatHandler(final GameManager gameManager, final ChatFilter chatFilter,
      final ConnectedUsers users, @GameChatEnabled final boolean gameChatEnabled) {
    super(gameManager);
    this.chatFilter = chatFilter;
    this.users = users;
    this.gameChatEnabled = gameChatEnabled;
  }
```
