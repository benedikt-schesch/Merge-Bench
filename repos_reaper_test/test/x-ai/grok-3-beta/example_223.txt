Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent behind the changes on both sides of the merge is ambiguous without further context. I have kept the spacing and content exactly as provided.

```java
        return buildPlan(query, LogicalPlanBuilder.class.getClassLoader());
    }

    public LogicalPlan buildPlan(String query, ClassLoader cldr) {
        LogicalPlanBuilder.classloader = cldr;
<<<<<<< HEAD
        PigContext pigContext = new PigContext(ExecType.LOCAL, new Properties());
=======
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        LogicalPlanBuilder builder = new LogicalPlanBuilder(pigContext); //

        try {
            LogicalPlan lp = builder.parse("Test-Plan-Builder",
                                           query,
```

### Explanation:
- **Conflict Analysis**: The conflict arises in the initialization of `PigContext`. On the `HEAD` side, there is an explicit initialization of `PigContext` with `ExecType.LOCAL` and a new `Properties` object. On the other branch (`1488b22`), this initialization is absent, and there are no alternative changes provided in the snippet for this line.
- **Intent Ambiguity**: It is unclear whether the removal of the `PigContext` initialization in the other branch was intentional (e.g., to use a default or previously defined context) or if it was an accidental omission. Additionally, the `pigContext` variable is used in the subsequent line (`new LogicalPlanBuilder(pigContext)`), which suggests that the initialization might be necessary unless it is defined elsewhere outside this snippet.
- **Resolution Decision**: Since the intent cannot be confidently determined without additional context (e.g., whether `pigContext` is defined elsewhere or if a different initialization is intended), I have chosen to return the snippet with the conflict markers intact. If further context or clarification is provided, I can assist in resolving the conflict.

If you can provide more details about the surrounding code or the purpose of the changes in the branch, I will be happy to help resolve this merge conflict.
