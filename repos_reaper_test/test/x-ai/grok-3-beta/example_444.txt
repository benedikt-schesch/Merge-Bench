I'll analyze this merge conflict by looking at the intent and semantics of both sides.

- **HEAD side intent**: The code on the HEAD side is initializing two objects, `soundManager` and `dpPrefs`, and setting up `lbm` (likely for local broadcast management). These seem to be general application-level or utility initializations, not directly related to a specific feature like Dronekit.
- **Other side (81014198) intent**: The code on the other branch is introducing a method `initDronekit()` and starting to define a `Context` variable. The subsequent lines (outside the conflict) show that this method is responsible for initializing Dronekit-related components like `controlTower`, `drone`, and `missionProxy`. This appears to be a specific initialization for Dronekit functionality.

**Analysis**: The conflict arises because the two branches are modifying the same area of the code, likely within an initialization method (e.g., `onCreate` or similar). The HEAD side is adding general utilities, while the other branch is creating a dedicated method for Dronekit initialization. Since the intents are different and complementary (one is about general app setup and the other is about a specific feature), they can likely be merged by ensuring both pieces of logic are preserved. However, since the other branch introduces a method definition (`initDronekit()`), and the HEAD side's code doesn't appear to belong inside this method semantically, I will preserve the conflict as is because the exact placement and integration of these changes depend on the broader context of the codebase (e.g., whether this is in `onCreate` or another method, and whether `initDronekit()` should be called separately).

Here is the unchanged snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
        if(BuildConfig.ENABLE_CRASHLYTICS) {
            Fabric.with(context, new Crashlytics());
        }
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
        soundManager = new SoundManager(context);

        dpPrefs = DroidPlannerPrefs.getInstance(context);
        lbm = LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(context);
=======
    private void initDronekit(){
        Context context = getApplicationContext();
>>>>>>> 81014198f34bd4d5b4efb7bed4cad43203da4d42

        controlTower = new ControlTower(context);
        drone = new Drone(context);
        missionProxy = new MissionProxy(context, this.drone);
```
