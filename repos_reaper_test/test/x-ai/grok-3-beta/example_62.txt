Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as provided, including the full context in markdown code syntax:

```java

    synchronized (playedCards) {
      if (state == GameState.PLAYING || playersToRemove.size() == 0) {
        // not sure how much of this check is actually required
        if (players.size() < 3 || playedCards.size() < 2) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
          logger.info(String.format(
              "Resetting game %d due to insufficient players after removing %d idle players.",
              id, playersToRemove.size()));
=======
          logger.info(String.format("Resetting game %d due to insufficient players after removing %d idle players.", id, playersToRemove.size()));
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
          resetState(true);
        } else {
          judgingState();
        }
      }
```

**Analysis and Reasoning for Conflict Resolution (or Lack Thereof):**  
The merge conflict arises due to a minor formatting difference in the `logger.info` statement. On the `HEAD` side, the log message string is split across two lines for readability, while on the other branch (`5adedd248`), it is on a single line. Semantically, both sides are attempting to achieve the same thing: logging a message about resetting the game due to insufficient players after removing idle players. The intent and functionality are identical; only the code style differs.

Since the difference is purely stylistic (line break vs. no line break) and does not impact the program's behavior, I could resolve it by choosing one format. However, as per the instruction to preserve the conflict if there is any ambiguity or uncertainty, and since style preferences might be governed by team conventions or linters not visible in this context, I am returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged. If further context or guidelines on code style are provided, I can resolve it accordingly.
