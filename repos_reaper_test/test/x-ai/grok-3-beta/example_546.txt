I'll return the code snippet with the resolved merge conflict. After analyzing the semantics and intent of both sides, I can see that the changes are identical in both branches, so the conflict can be resolved by keeping the content from either side as they are the same. I will preserve the original context and spacing as provided.

```java

        if (StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(defSource) && jaxRsResources.isEmpty()) {
            failWithErrorMessage("You should specify the definition source to use (value no prefixed by any option). ");
        }

        if (!StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(language) && !SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.contains(language)) {
            failWithErrorMessage("The language " + language + " is not currently supported. ");
        }

        if (StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(serviceUrl)) {
            serviceUrl = "https://apispark.restlet.com/";
        }
