Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, presented in markdown code syntax exactly as given, including the full context and preserving all spacing. Following that, I will provide an analysis of the conflict and my reasoning on how to resolve it based on semantic intent.

```java
import jenkins.util.SystemProperties;

### Analysis and Resolution Reasoning

- **Context of the Code**: This snippet appears to be part of a Java file (likely in a Jenkins-related project, given the `jenkins.util` and `org.kohsuke` packages). It consists of import statements for various classes, which are used to bring in dependencies required by the file. The conflict occurs in the middle of the imports list, specifically around the inclusion or exclusion of `org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.DoNotUse`.

- **Conflict Details**:
  - **HEAD (Left Side)**: Includes `import org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.DoNotUse;`. This suggests that the developer on this branch intended to use the `DoNotUse` restriction class, likely to annotate something in the code as not intended for use, a common practice in API deprecation or restricted access scenarios in libraries like Jenkins.
  - **7cf5285 (Right Side)**: Removes or does not include the `DoNotUse` import. This could imply that the import was deemed unnecessary (e.g., no code in the file uses `DoNotUse`), or it was intentionally removed as part of a cleanup or change in policy regarding the use of such annotations.

- **Semantic Intent**:
  - The intent of the HEAD side is likely to ensure that the `DoNotUse` class is available for restricting access or marking deprecated functionality, which is a common practice in maintaining APIs in large systems like Jenkins.
  - The intent of the right side (merge commit `7cf5285`) is ambiguous without additional context. It could be a deliberate removal if `DoNotUse` is no longer needed or if its usage was incorrect, or it could be an accidental omission during a merge or rebase.

- **Resolution Decision**:
  Since the intent of the HEAD side is clear (to include the import for potential use of `DoNotUse`), and the intent of the right side is ambiguous (no clear reason for removal is evident from the snippet alone), the safer and more semantically preserving choice is to retain the import. In Java, unused imports do not cause runtime issues (though they may trigger warnings in some IDEs or static analysis tools), so keeping the import is unlikely to cause harm. If the import is indeed unnecessary, it can be removed later via a cleanup commit with proper justification.

- **Resolved Code**: Therefore, I propose resolving the conflict by keeping the `import org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.DoNotUse;` line as follows:

```java
import jenkins.util.SystemProperties;
import org.acegisecurity.context.SecurityContext;
import org.acegisecurity.context.SecurityContextHolder;
import org.kohsuke.accmod.Restricted;
import org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.Beta;
import org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.DoNotUse;
import org.kohsuke.stapler.HttpRedirect;
import org.kohsuke.stapler.HttpResponse;
import org.kohsuke.stapler.QueryParameter;
import org.kohsuke.stapler.StaplerRequest;
import org.kohsuke.stapler.StaplerResponse;
```

If further context (e.g., the rest of the file or commit messages) indicates that `DoNotUse` should not be imported, this resolution can be revisited. For now, preserving the import aligns with the apparent intent of the HEAD branch.
