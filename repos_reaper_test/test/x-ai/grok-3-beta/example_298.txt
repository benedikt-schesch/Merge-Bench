Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. Since the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict are ambiguous without additional context about the surrounding codebase (e.g., the definition and purpose of `mapper`, `reader`, `json`, and how `DocumentStream` is used), I am returning the snippet unchanged. My analysis of the potential intent is provided after the snippet, but I will not attempt a resolution without clarity.

```java

    public <T> T unmarshall(DBObject document, Class<T> clazz) throws MarshallingException {

        DocumentStream stream = DocumentStreamFactory.fromDBObject(document);
        try {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            return mapper.readValue(stream.getData(), stream.getOffset(), stream.getSize(), clazz);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            String message = String.format("Unable to unmarshall result to %s from content %s", clazz, document.toString());
=======
            return reader.withType(clazz).readValue(json);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            String message = String.format("Unable to unmarshall from json: %s to %s", json, clazz);
>>>>>>> 4dad4b6f9ffd42aaf0a81bf4fc4026ac51e656d0
            throw new MarshallingException(message, e);
        }
    }

    public DBObject marshall(Object obj) throws MarshallingException {

```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD Side**: The code uses a `mapper` to read values from a `DocumentStream` object, utilizing methods like `getData()`, `getOffset()`, and `getSize()`. This suggests a custom or specific deserialization process tied to the `DocumentStream` abstraction, likely for handling binary or structured data. The error message references the original `document.toString()` as the content source, and it catches `IOException`, indicating the operation might involve I/O operations.
- **4dad4b6f9ffd42aaf0a81bf4fc4026ac51e656d0 Side**: This side uses a `reader` with a type configuration (`withType(clazz)`) to deserialize from a `json` variable (which is not defined in the provided context). The error message mentions `json` as the source, and it catches a more general `Exception`, suggesting a broader error handling approach. This implies a shift towards a JSON-based deserialization process, possibly using a library like Jackson.
- **Conflict Reasoning**: The two sides appear to have different approaches to deserialization. The HEAD side seems tied to a stream-based or custom data structure (`DocumentStream`), while the other side appears to assume a JSON string or object as input. Without knowing whether `json` is derived from `stream` or if `mapper` and `reader` are interchangeable (e.g., both from a library like Jackson), or the broader context of the codebase's evolution, it's unclear which approach should be prioritized or if a hybrid solution is needed.
- **Conclusion**: Due to the ambiguity in intent and lack of context about variable definitions and library usage, I am not resolving the conflict. A resolution would require understanding the relationship between `mapper` and `reader`, the origin of `json`, and the intended data format for unmarshalling.

If additional context or clarification is provided, I can attempt a resolution. For now, the snippet is returned with the conflict intact.
