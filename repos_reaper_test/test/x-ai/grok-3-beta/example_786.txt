Below is the snippet with the merge conflict included, as requested, along with the resolution based on semantic intent. I have preserved the original context and spacing exactly as provided. Following the snippet, I will explain my reasoning for the resolution.

```java
   * @param deferred A deferred one can wait on before retrying the failed RPC.
   */
  PleaseThrottleException(final String msg,
                          final HBaseException cause,
                          final HBaseRpc rpc,
<<<<<<< HEAD
                          final Deferred deferred) {
=======
                          final Deferred<?> deferred) {
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    super(msg, cause);
    this.rpc = rpc;
    this.deferred = deferred;
  }
```

### Explanation of Resolution:
After analyzing the merge conflict, it is clear that the conflict centers around the type specification of the `Deferred` parameter in the constructor of `PleaseThrottleException`.

- **HEAD (Original Branch):** Uses `Deferred` without a generic type parameter.
- **Incoming Branch (d543609...):** Uses `Deferred<?>` with a wildcard generic type parameter.

**Semantic Intent Analysis:**
- The `Deferred` class appears to be a generic type (likely similar to a `Future` or a promise in asynchronous programming), and the intent on both sides seems to be to allow the `deferred` parameter to accept any type of `Deferred` object.
- The HEAD branch omits the generic type, which might imply raw type usage (potentially less type-safe and outdated in modern Java practices, as raw types can lead to unchecked warnings or runtime errors).
- The incoming branch explicitly uses `Deferred<?>`, indicating a wildcard type, which is a more modern and type-safe approach. It clearly communicates that the specific type of the `Deferred` is irrelevant to the constructor's logic, and it avoids raw type warnings.

**Resolution Decision:**
The intent of both sides is likely the same: to allow flexibility in the type of `Deferred` passed to the constructor. However, the incoming branch (`Deferred<?>`) provides a more explicit and safer representation of this intent by using a wildcard. This aligns with modern Java best practices for generics, ensuring better code clarity and avoiding potential issues with raw types.

**Resolved Code:**
```java
   * @param deferred A deferred one can wait on before retrying the failed RPC.
   */
  PleaseThrottleException(final String msg,
                          final HBaseException cause,
                          final HBaseRpc rpc,
                          final Deferred<?> deferred) {
    super(msg, cause);
    this.rpc = rpc;
    this.deferred = deferred;
  }
```

This resolution adopts the incoming branch's approach (`Deferred<?>`), as it better captures the semantic intent of type flexibility while adhering to modern Java conventions for type safety.
