I'll return the provided code snippet as is, preserving the context and spacing, since the intent behind the merge conflict is not entirely clear without additional context about the purpose of the added field `projectConfigurationManager` or its relationship to the existing code.

```java
	@Inject
	private BuildListenerRegistry registry;

	protected AndroidBuildService buildService;

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
	private IProjectConfigurationManager projectConfigurationManager;

>>>>>>> b782a4bb6b4349d23790909d1e67891adbaa126c
	@Override
	@SuppressWarnings("restriction")
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
	    super.setUp();
```

**Explanation of Decision:**  
The conflict arises from the addition of a new field `private IProjectConfigurationManager projectConfigurationManager;` in the branch `b782a4bb6b4349d23790909d1e67891adbaa126c`, which is not present in the `HEAD` branch. Without further context about how this field is used or its purpose in the codebase, it is unclear whether it should be included or if it conflicts with existing functionality. The intent of both sides cannot be fully determined from this snippet alone. Therefore, I am preserving the conflict markers and returning the snippet unchanged for manual resolution or additional context. If more surrounding code or information about the field's usage is provided, I can reassess the intent and propose a resolution.
