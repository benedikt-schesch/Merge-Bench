I'll return the code snippet with the resolved merge conflict, maintaining the full context and spacing as provided. Based on the semantics and intent, it appears that one side of the merge uses traditional `try` block syntax for `ServerSocket`, while the other side uses the more modern `try-with-resources` syntax, which automatically closes the resource. The intent of both sides is to manage the `ServerSocket` properly, but `try-with-resources` is the more modern and safer approach as it ensures the socket is closed even if an exception occurs.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
	private List<TestEvent> sendMessageWithServerSocket(String input) throws UnknownHostException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
		return sendMessageWithServerSocket(new String[] { input });
	}

	private List<TestEvent> sendMessageWithServerSocket(String... messages) throws UnknownHostException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
		try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(0)) {
			RuntimeEnvironment fakeEnvironment = fakeEnvironment();
			File file = fakeEnvironment.createClasspathArgumentFile();
			
			ClasspathArgumentBuilder classpathArgumentBuilder = new FileClasspathArgumentBuilder(file);
			factory.startProcess(serverSocket.getLocalPort(), fakeEnvironment, classpathArgumentBuilder);
```

**Resolution Explanation:** I chose the `try-with-resources` syntax (`try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(0))`) from the `6b1656b15012f02e489b801a3498ffdd9ca95f93` branch because it aligns with modern Java practices (introduced in Java 7) for resource management. This ensures that the `ServerSocket` is automatically closed when the block is exited, reducing the risk of resource leaks compared to the traditional `try` block in the `HEAD` branch, which would require an explicit `finally` block to close the socket (which is not present in the provided snippet). The intent of both sides is to properly manage the `ServerSocket`, and this resolution achieves that in a safer and more concise way. Note that I have preserved the spacing and context exactly as provided, only removing the conflict markers and selecting the appropriate line for resolution. The closing brace `}` is omitted in the snippet as it was not fully provided in the original context.
