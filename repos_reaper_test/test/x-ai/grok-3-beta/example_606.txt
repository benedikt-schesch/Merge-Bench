I'll return the provided snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent and semantics of the changes are ambiguous without further context about the purpose of the code or the specific changes intended in each branch. The conflict appears to involve the presence or absence of a `serialVersionUID` field, but I cannot determine whether it should be included or excluded based on the given information.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax and maintaining the original spacing:

```java

  }

  public static class MailingAddress extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    /**
     * The mailing address ID.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter

```
