Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given with all spacing and context intact. Following that, I will provide an analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict to propose a resolution.

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

Let's break down the differences between the two sides of the merge conflict to understand the intent behind each:

- **HEAD (Left Side):**
  - Imports `com.alorma.github.ui.activity.base.BackActivity` as the base activity class, suggesting that the codebase in this branch is using `BackActivity` for some UI functionality, likely related to navigation or activity lifecycle management.
  - Includes common utility imports like `IntentHelper` and `UriUtils` for handling intents and URIs.

- **f8f91f1d (Right Side):**
  - Imports `com.alorma.github.ui.activity.base.RepositoryThemeActivity` instead of `BackActivity`, indicating a shift or update to a different base activity class, possibly to support theming or repository-specific UI features.
  - Also includes the same utility imports (`IntentHelper` and `UriUtils`) as the HEAD side.
  - Adds an additional import, `com.alorma.github.utils.AttributesUtils`, which is not present in the HEAD side. This suggests that the right side branch might be using additional utility functions or attributes for styling or other purposes.

### Semantic Intent
- Both sides are working on the same codebase and are managing UI-related imports for an Android activity context, as evidenced by the base activity imports and shared utility imports.
- The key difference is the base activity class (`BackActivity` vs. `RepositoryThemeActivity`), which suggests a possible refactoring or feature enhancement on the right side to adopt a more specialized or updated base class.
- The additional `AttributesUtils` import on the right side indicates that this branch may have introduced new functionality or dependencies that require attribute handling.

### Proposed Resolution
Given the semantics, it appears that the right side (`f8f91f1d`) represents a more recent or intentional update to the base activity class (`RepositoryThemeActivity`) and introduces a new utility (`AttributesUtils`). The left side (`HEAD`) might represent an older or less updated state of the codebase. Therefore, I would propose resolving the conflict by adopting the right side's imports, as they seem to reflect the intended direction of the codebase (e.g., updated activity class and additional utilities).

Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict markers removed, adopting the right side's changes:

```java
import com.alorma.github.sdk.bean.dto.response.User;
import com.alorma.github.sdk.bean.info.IssueInfo;
import com.alorma.github.sdk.bean.info.RepoInfo;
import com.alorma.github.sdk.services.repo.GetRepoContributorsClient;
import com.alorma.github.sdk.services.search.UsersSearchClient;
import com.alorma.github.ui.activity.base.RepositoryThemeActivity;
import com.alorma.github.ui.utils.IntentHelper;
import com.alorma.github.ui.utils.uris.UriUtils;
import com.alorma.github.utils.AttributesUtils;
import com.alorma.gitskarios.core.Pair;
import com.github.mobile.util.HtmlUtils;
import com.karumi.dexter.Dexter;
import com.karumi.dexter.listener.PermissionGrantedResponse;
import com.karumi.dexter.listener.single.EmptyPermissionListener;
```

### Caveat
If there is a specific reason to retain `BackActivity` (e.g., backward compatibility, specific features tied to it, or if `RepositoryThemeActivity` is not fully implemented/tested), then a more cautious approach might be needed, such as consulting with the team or checking the broader context of the codebase. In the absence of such information, I have leaned toward the right side as it appears to represent a deliberate update. If this assumption is incorrect, the original conflict snippet (preserved above) can be revisited.
