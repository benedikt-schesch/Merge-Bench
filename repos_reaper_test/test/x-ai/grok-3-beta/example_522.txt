I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and resolve it based on the intent and semantics of both sides. Below is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, followed by my analysis and resolution.

### Original Code Snippet with Conflict
```java
            boolean skipMissingFiles = parser.getOptionValue(skipMissingOpt) != null;
            if(skipMissingFiles) {
                options = options | CSSURLEmbedder.SKIP_MISSING_OPTION;
            }
            
<<<<<<< HEAD
            CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, maxurilength, maximagesize);            
=======
            CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, uriLength);
>>>>>>> 790b69a0bd40e3ab536f9c6568748f981b3d525e
            embedder.setMHTMLRoot(mhtmlRoot);
            
            //close in case writing to the same file
            in.close(); in = null;
```

### Analysis
- **HEAD Side Intent (Left Side):** The code uses a constructor for `CSSURLEmbedder` with five parameters: `in`, `options`, `verbose`, `maxurilength`, and `maximagesize`. This suggests that the intent is to initialize the `CSSURLEmbedder` with constraints on both URI length and image size, providing more control over the embedding process.
- **Other Side Intent (Right Side, commit `790b69a0`):** The code uses a constructor with four parameters: `in`, `options`, `verbose`, and `uriLength`. This indicates a simpler initialization, focusing only on URI length without considering image size constraints, or possibly a refactoring where `maximagesize` was removed or combined into another parameter.
- **Semantic Difference:** The key difference is the number of parameters in the constructor call. The HEAD side includes an additional parameter `maximagesize`, suggesting it might be from a branch where additional functionality or constraints (e.g., limiting image size for embedding) were introduced. The other side might be from a branch with a different version of the constructor or where `maximagesize` is not needed or handled differently.

### Potential Resolution Considerations
- **Constructor Signature Check:** Without access to the full codebase or the `CSSURLEmbedder` class definition, I cannot confirm which constructor signature is correct or if both are valid (e.g., due to overloading). If the HEAD side's additional parameter `maximagesize` is part of a newer or specific feature, it should be retained. If the other side reflects a refactored or updated API where `maximagesize` is obsolete or moved, its constructor might be the intended one.
- **Variable Naming:** Note that `maxurilength` (HEAD) and `uriLength` (other side) likely refer to the same concept, just with different naming conventions. This suggests a possible rename in one branch.
- **Intent Alignment:** Both sides aim to initialize a `CSSURLEmbedder` with input, options, verbosity, and URI length constraints. The HEAD side adds an extra constraint for image size, which might be critical for its branch's purpose (e.g., optimizing or limiting embedded content).

### Resolution
Since I cannot definitively determine the correct constructor without additional context (e.g., class definition, project changelog, or branch purposes), and the intent of both sides is clear but potentially divergent, I will preserve the conflict as-is. If forced to resolve, I would lean toward the HEAD side due to its inclusion of an additional parameter (`maximagesize`), which might indicate a more complete or feature-rich implementation, but this is speculative.

However, as per the instruction to return the snippet with the conflict if unsure, I will not modify the code. Below is the unchanged snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
            boolean skipMissingFiles = parser.getOptionValue(skipMissingOpt) != null;
            if(skipMissingFiles) {
                options = options | CSSURLEmbedder.SKIP_MISSING_OPTION;
            }
            
<<<<<<< HEAD
            CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, maxurilength, maximagesize);            
=======
            CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, uriLength);
>>>>>>> 790b69a0bd40e3ab536f9c6568748f981b3d525e
            embedder.setMHTMLRoot(mhtmlRoot);
            
            //close in case writing to the same file
            in.close(); in = null;
```

If you can provide additional context about the `CSSURLEmbedder` class constructors or the purpose of each branch, I can offer a more precise resolution.
