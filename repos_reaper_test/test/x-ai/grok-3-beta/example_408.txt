I'm returning the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent and semantics of the conflicting changes are ambiguous without additional context about the purpose of the imports and how they are used in the codebase. 

```java
package org.jbake.app;

import org.jbake.TestUtils;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.ConfigUtil;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.DefaultJBakeConfiguration;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
=======
import org.jbake.app.configuration.PropertyList;
>>>>>>> d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.rules.TemporaryFolder;
```

**Reasoning**:  
- On the `HEAD` side, the imports include `JBakeProperty` and `DocumentModel`, suggesting that the code might be dealing with specific property configurations or document-related functionality in the test or class.
- On the `d68ddea` side, the import is for `PropertyList`, which might indicate a refactoring or a shift to using a different approach for handling properties (perhaps a collection or list of properties).
- Without further context about the usage of these imports in the code (e.g., what classes or methods are being tested), it is unclear whether one import should replace the other, both are needed, or if they serve entirely different purposes. Merging them prematurely could introduce errors or miss the intent of either side.

If additional context or clarification about the purpose of these imports is provided (e.g., the body of the test class or related commits), I can assist in resolving the conflict semantically.
