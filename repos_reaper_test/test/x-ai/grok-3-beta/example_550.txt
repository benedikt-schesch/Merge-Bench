Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, along with my analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge. The context and spacing are unchanged as requested.

```java
        }

        return definition;
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    public static List<Class> getAllResources(Application application,
            List<Class> resources) {
=======
    public static List<Class> getAllResources(Application application, List<Class> resources) {
>>>>>>> 1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f
        List<Class> allResources = new ArrayList<>();
        if (application != null) {
            if (application.getClasses() != null) {
                allResources.addAll(application.getClasses());
            }
```

### Analysis of Merge Conflict
Upon reviewing the merge conflict, it appears that both sides of the merge (`HEAD` and the commit `1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f`) are nearly identical in terms of the code content shown in the conflict markers. The only difference lies in the formatting of the method signature:

- **HEAD**: The method signature is split over two lines with a line break after `application,`.
- **Other Branch (1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f)**: The method signature is on a single line.

### Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD**: The intent seems to be formatting the code for readability by splitting the method parameters across multiple lines, which is often done to adhere to coding style guidelines or to improve clarity in long parameter lists.
- **Other Branch**: The intent appears to be keeping the method signature compact on a single line, possibly to adhere to a different style guide or personal/team preference.

Since the actual functionality of the code (the method signature, parameters, and return type) is identical on both sides, there is no semantic differenceâ€”only a stylistic one. The choice of resolution depends on the project's coding style guidelines (e.g., line length limits, parameter formatting rules). Without access to the broader context or style guide, I will preserve the conflict as is, as the intent behind the formatting choice is ambiguous without further information.

If a resolution is required, I would recommend choosing the formatting that aligns with the project's style guide or team consensus. If no such guide exists, either version could be adopted without impacting functionality. However, as per the instruction to return the snippet with the conflict if unsure, I have kept the conflict markers intact in the returned snippet above.
