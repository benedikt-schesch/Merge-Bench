I'll analyze the merge conflict and explain my resolution approach based on the intent and semantics. Here's the provided snippet with full context preserved in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
import jenkins.util.SystemProperties;
import org.acegisecurity.context.SecurityContext;
import org.acegisecurity.context.SecurityContextHolder;
import org.kohsuke.accmod.Restricted;
import org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.Beta;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.DoNotUse;
=======
>>>>>>> f2aea1563fc4d150c8231efbb2ad89a0a539f166
import org.kohsuke.stapler.HttpRedirect;
import org.kohsuke.stapler.HttpResponse;
import org.kohsuke.stapler.QueryParameter;
import org.kohsuke.stapler.StaplerRequest;
import org.kohsuke.stapler.StaplerResponse;
```

**Analysis and Resolution Reasoning:**

Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that:

- On the `HEAD` side, there is an import statement `import org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.DoNotUse;`. This suggests that the code on this branch explicitly needs or uses the `DoNotUse` restriction annotation, possibly to mark certain elements as deprecated or not for public use in the context of Jenkins (given the other imports related to Jenkins and security).
- On the other branch (`f2aea1563fc4d150c8231efbb2ad89a0a539f166`), there is no corresponding import or content in this conflict section. This could indicate that the import was removed, or it was never present in that branch, possibly because the `DoNotUse` restriction isn't needed or was intentionally omitted.

**Intent and Semantics:**

The intent on the `HEAD` side appears to be ensuring that the `DoNotUse` restriction is available for use in the codebase, likely to enforce certain access or usage policies. The other branch's intent is ambiguous since it shows no content in the conflict area, which might mean the import was deemed unnecessary or was removed.

However, since the `DoNotUse` import does not conflict with any other code in the snippet and it is a specific addition on one side, removing it could potentially break the code that relies on this annotation in the `HEAD` branch. On the other hand, including it does not appear to introduce any harm or conflict with the rest of the imports or context.

**Resolution:**

Given that the intent of the `HEAD` branch is clear (to include the `DoNotUse` import) and the other branch does not explicitly counteract this by adding conflicting code or removing it with a clear purpose, I would resolve the conflict by retaining the `HEAD` change. However, since my instruction is to return the snippet unchanged if I'm not entirely sure or if the intent is ambiguous, and considering that the other branch's intent is not fully clear (it might have removed the import intentionally), I will preserve the conflict as is.

Thus, I am returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged as provided above. If additional context or clarification about the intent of the `f2aea1563fc4d150c8231efbb2ad89a0a539f166` branch is available, I can revisit the resolution.
