I'm returning the provided code snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the conflict does not contain any actual conflicting code changes that need resolution. The conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`) are present, but there is no code content between them that indicates a specific change or intent on either side of the merge. Without additional context or conflicting code, I cannot deduce the semantic intent or resolve the conflict.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved, maintaining the original formatting and context:

```java
import org.hbase.async.KeyValue;
import org.hbase.async.PutRequest;
import org.hbase.async.RowLock;
import org.hbase.async.RowLockRequest;
import org.hbase.async.Scanner;
