### Analysis and Resolution

**Intent and Semantics of Both Sides:**

- **HEAD (Left Side):** The HEAD side does not include any imports in the conflicted section. This could imply that either no additional imports were needed or that this version of the code does not yet account for dependencies on `AsyncTask` or the `TMDbClient` class. The absence of these imports might indicate that this side of the merge is either incomplete or represents a version of the code that does not require these dependencies.

- **Incoming Change (Right Side - 971b9954a7a2b57c88112a78a07f3c750d7d8e14):** The incoming change introduces two imports:
  - `import android.os.AsyncTask;`: This suggests that the code in this file likely involves asynchronous task execution, which is common in Android development for background operations.
  - `import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.api.TMDbClient;`: This indicates a dependency on a custom API client class for interacting with The Movie Database (TMDb), which is likely used for fetching media-related data.

**Contextual Clues:**
- The package name `com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.task` suggests that this file is part of a task-related module, likely involving background operations or API calls.
- Other imports in the context (e.g., `TaskListener`, `Config`, `VideoUtils`) indicate that this file is part of a larger system handling tasks, configurations, and video processing, which aligns with the need for `AsyncTask` and an API client like `TMDbClient`.

**Semantic Intent:**
- The HEAD side might be an earlier or alternative version of the code that either does not yet include necessary dependencies or intentionally omits them (though the latter is less likely given the context).
- The incoming change (971b9954a7a2b57c88112a78a07f3c750d7d8e14) is likely adding necessary imports to support functionality involving asynchronous tasks and API interactions with TMDb, which are critical for the intended behavior of a task-related class in this package.

**Resolution Decision:**
Given the context and the likely purpose of this file (handling tasks and API interactions), the incoming change on the right side (971b9954a7a2b57c88112a78a07f3c750d7d8e14) appears to be the correct and necessary addition. The imports for `AsyncTask` and `TMDbClient` are semantically consistent with the purpose of a class in the `task` package, especially in an Android application dealing with media data.

Therefore, the resolved version of the code snippet should include the imports from the incoming change.
