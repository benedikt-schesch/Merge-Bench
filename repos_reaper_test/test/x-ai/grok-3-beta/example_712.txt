Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as provided, followed by my analysis and resolution based on the semantic intent of both sides of the merge.

```java
                am.setUserData(account, MANDELLA_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATIONTIME_HATCHET,
                        String.valueOf(accessTokenExpiresIn));
                ensureAccessTokens();
            }
        }
<<<<<<< HEAD

        InfoSystem.getInstance().resolve(getLoggedInUser());

                AuthenticatorManager.CONFIG_TEST_RESULT_TYPE_SUCCESS);
    }
```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Intent of HEAD (left side):**
- The code explicitly calls individual methods to fetch specific collections (`fetchPlaylists()`, `fetchLovedItemsPlaylist()`, `fetchStarredArtists()`, `fetchStarredAlbums()`).
- Additionally, it calls `InfoSystem.getInstance().resolve(getLoggedInUser())`, which appears to perform some user-related resolution or initialization.
- The intent seems to be very specific about which collections to fetch and includes an additional operation unrelated to fetching collections.

**Intent of the other side (commit `760cca9f` - right side):**
- The code uses a single method, `fetchAll()`, which likely encapsulates fetching all relevant collections in a more generalized or simplified manner.
- The intent appears to be a refactoring or optimization to avoid calling multiple specific fetch methods, replacing them with a single call that presumably handles all necessary fetching.

**Semantic Merge Conflict Resolution:**
- Combining the intents, it seems that `fetchAll()` on the right side likely covers the functionality of the individual fetch methods on the left side. However, the left side also includes `InfoSystem.getInstance().resolve(getLoggedInUser())`, which is not mentioned on the right side and might be an additional operation not covered by `fetchAll()`.
- To preserve the intent of both sides, I will assume `fetchAll()` is a comprehensive method for fetching all collections (as implied by its name) and should replace the individual fetch calls. However, I will retain the `resolve` call from the HEAD side since it appears to be a separate concern not addressed by `fetchAll()`.

**Resolved Code:**
```java
                am.setUserData(account, MANDELLA_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATIONTIME_HATCHET,
                        String.valueOf(accessTokenExpiresIn));
                ensureAccessTokens();
            }
        }
        CollectionManager.getInstance().fetchAll();
        InfoSystem.getInstance().resolve(getLoggedInUser());
        AuthenticatorManager.broadcastConfigTestResult(getId(),
                AuthenticatorManager.CONFIG_TEST_RESULT_PLUGINTYPE_AUTHUTILS,
                AuthenticatorManager.CONFIG_TEST_RESULT_TYPE_SUCCESS);
    }
```

**Rationale for Resolution:**
- Used `fetchAll()` to replace the multiple specific fetch calls, assuming it semantically covers all the individual fetches (`fetchPlaylists`, `fetchLovedItemsPlaylist`, `fetchStarredArtists`, `fetchStarredAlbums`).
- Retained `InfoSystem.getInstance().resolve(getLoggedInUser())` as it likely serves a purpose beyond fetching collections and was explicitly included in the HEAD branch.
- This resolution balances the intent of simplification from the right side with the explicit additional operation from the left side.
- If `fetchAll()` does not cover all the specific fetches or if `resolve` is redundant with `fetchAll()`, this resolution might need revisiting with more context from the codebase or developers. However, based on the given information and semantic naming, this appears to be the most reasonable merge.

If there is any ambiguity in the functionality of `fetchAll()` or `resolve`, or if further context is needed, please let me know, and I can revert to the original conflict or adjust accordingly.
