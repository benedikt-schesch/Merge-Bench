I'll analyze the merge conflict based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

- **HEAD**: The test method is named `shouldNotUpdateIfClassesAreNotChanged` and uses `assertDoesNotThrow` to verify that processing an empty event does not throw an exception. The intent seems to focus on ensuring the process doesn't fail under these conditions.
- **Incoming changes (ee249315)**: The test method has the same name but is written as a public void method, and it includes a call to `verifyNoInteractions(workspace)`. The intent here appears to be verifying that no interactions occur with the `workspace` when processing an empty event.

Both sides are testing the same behavior (no update when classes are unchanged), but the incoming change explicitly checks for no interactions with the workspace, which is a more specific assertion. Since `verifyNoInteractions(workspace)` aligns with the test name (indicating no updates should happen) and is a stronger verification than just checking for no exceptions, it seems reasonable to adopt the incoming change. Additionally, the `assertDoesNotThrow` in HEAD is redundant if the test would fail on any thrown exception anyway.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved as provided:

```java

		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);		
	}

	@Test
	public void shouldNotUpdateIfClassesAreNotChanged() throws CoreException {
		processor.processEvent(emptyEvent());

		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

	@Test
	void shouldRespondToPostBuildEvents() {
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, POST_BUILD, AUTO_BUILD, null);

```
