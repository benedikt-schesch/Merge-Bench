I'll resolve this merge conflict by considering the intent and semantics of both sides. The conflict arises from two different ways of writing assertions in a test method. One side uses `assertThat` from Hamcrest (a matcher library commonly used in testing), while the other side uses `assertEquals` (likely from JUnit or another testing framework). The intent of both is to verify that the cursor values returned by `getAfterCursor()` and `getBeforeCursor()` match the expected strings. I'll choose the `assertThat` style from the HEAD branch as it is often preferred for its readability and flexibility in modern testing practices, but the decision could go either way depending on project conventions. Since no additional context is provided about the project's testing framework or style guide, I'll prioritize readability.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved as provided:

```java
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_withCursor() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = createCursorConnection();
    assertThat(connection.getAfterCursor()).isEqualTo("NzU1MjI1MjU0");
    assertThat(connection.getBeforeCursor()).isEqualTo("MTY1MTAyNjUxNg==");
  }

  private Connection<FacebookType> createCursorConnection() {
    FakeWebRequestor fakeWebRequestor = new FakeWebRequestor() {
      @Override
```
