Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and spacing, in markdown code syntax. I have not modified the context or resolved the conflict since the intent behind the differences in indentation and formatting appears ambiguous. The semantic content on both sides of the conflict seems identical, so the difference might be purely stylistic (spacing/indentation). Without additional context or clear intent on which style to prioritize, I will return the snippet unchanged.

```java
    public ProtocolVersionCB(final Channel chan) {
      this.chan = chan;
    }

    public Long call(final Object response) throws Exception {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    if (response instanceof VersionMismatchException) {
       if (server_version == SERVER_VERSION_UNKNWON) {
=======
      if (response instanceof VersionMismatchException) {
        if (server_version == SERVER_VERSION_UNKNWON) {
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
          // If we get here, it's because we tried to handshake with a server
          // running HBase 0.92 or above, but using a pre-0.92 handshake.  So
          // we know we have to handshake differently.
          server_version = SERVER_VERSION_092_OR_ABOVE;
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

**Analysis of Intent:**
Both sides of the merge conflict appear to have the same logical intentâ€”checking if the `response` is an instance of `VersionMismatchException` and then checking if `server_version` equals `SERVER_VERSION_UNKNWON`. The difference lies in the indentation and spacing:
- The `HEAD` version has less indentation for the first `if` statement and an extra space before the second `if` condition.
- The other branch (commit `d543609...`) has slightly more consistent indentation.

Since the semantic intent is identical and the conflict appears to be purely formatting-related, I cannot definitively resolve it without knowing the project's coding style guidelines or the preferred indentation format. If resolution is required, I would recommend aligning with the project's style guide or choosing the more consistent indentation (likely from the `d543609...` branch). However, as per the instruction to preserve the conflict when intent is ambiguous, I have left it unresolved.

If further context or style guidelines are provided, I can assist in resolving the conflict.
