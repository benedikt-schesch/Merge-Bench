I'll analyze the merge conflict and resolve it based on the apparent intent of both sides. Here's the code snippet with the full context preserved exactly as provided, followed by my resolution and reasoning.

```java
        .setInstructions(new JobUpdateInstructions()
            .setDesiredState(new InstanceTaskConfig()
                .setTask(newConfig.newBuilder())
                .setInstances(ImmutableSet.of(new Range(0, 2))))
            .setSettings(new JobUpdateSettings()
<<<<<<< HEAD
                .setUpdateStrategy(
                    JobUpdateStrategy.queueStrategy(new QueueJobUpdateStrategy().setGroupSize(1)))
=======
                .setUpdateGroupSize(updateGroupSize)
>>>>>>> 4e28e73bb83b75f1369a705d15c96e40fb7098e1
                .setRollbackOnFailure(true)
                .setMinWaitInInstanceRunningMs(WATCH_TIMEOUT.as(Time.MILLISECONDS).intValue())
                .setUpdateOnlyTheseInstances(ImmutableSet.of())));

    for (IInstanceTaskConfig config : configs) {
```

### Analysis and Resolution
After reviewing the conflict, I can see the following intents:
- **HEAD** side: The intent appears to be setting an update strategy using `JobUpdateStrategy.queueStrategy` with a specific group size of 1. This suggests a desire for a queued update approach with controlled rollout in groups of 1.
- **4e28e73** side: The intent is to use `setUpdateGroupSize(updateGroupSize)`, which likely allows for a configurable group size value passed as a variable (`updateGroupSize`), providing more flexibility in determining the size of update groups.

### Semantic Intent
Both sides are trying to control the grouping of instances during a job update, but they approach it differently. The `HEAD` side hardcodes a group size of 1 within a specific strategy (`queueStrategy`), while the `4e28e73` side uses a more generic method `setUpdateGroupSize` with a variable. Given that `4e28e73` appears to be a more flexible and configurable approach (using a variable), it likely represents a newer or more generalized implementation. However, I must also consider if `HEAD`'s use of `queueStrategy` implies a specific strategy that might be lost by adopting `4e28e73`'s approach.

Since I lack additional context about whether `setUpdateGroupSize` inherently implies the same strategy as `queueStrategy` or if they are distinct mechanisms, I cannot confidently determine if adopting one completely fulfills the intent of the other. Specifically:
- If `setUpdateGroupSize` is a replacement for the strategy mechanism or works within the same context as `queueStrategy`, then `4e28e73`'s approach is preferable due to its configurability.
- If `queueStrategy` represents a distinct update mechanism that is critical to the behavior intended by `HEAD`, then discarding it might break functionality.

### Decision
Given the ambiguity in the relationship between `setUpdateStrategy` with `queueStrategy` and `setUpdateGroupSize`, and without additional documentation or context to confirm that they serve the same purpose, I will preserve the merge conflict as is. Resolving this would require more information about the codebase, such as whether `setUpdateGroupSize` is part of or compatible with the intended update strategy.

Therefore, I return the snippet unchanged with the conflict markers intact, as shown above. If further context or clarification about the methods and their relationship is provided, I can revisit the resolution. For now, this ensures that no intent is lost due to an incorrect assumption.
