I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent behind the changes in the `HEAD` section is not entirely clear without additional context about the purpose of the custom deserializer list. The conflict involves differing initialization of the `deserializer` object: the `HEAD` side introduces a specific list of deserializers with an ISO8601 deserializer, while the other side (commit `97d4f628`) does not show the initialization of `deserializer` in the provided snippet, leaving ambiguity about its intended configuration. Without further information on whether the custom deserializer list is essential or if there's a broader context for its inclusion, I cannot confidently resolve the conflict.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
>>>>>>> 97d4f628bf2675efd7c06c6636b473b06d0e080b

		when(provider.parameterNamesFor(bark.getMethod())).thenReturn(new String[] { "dog" });
		when(provider.parameterNamesFor(bark.getMethod())).thenReturn(new String[] { "dog" });

<<<<<<< HEAD
		List<JsonDeserializer> deserializers = new ArrayList<JsonDeserializer>();
		deserializers.add(new br.com.caelum.vraptor.serialization.iso8601.gson.CalendarISO8601Deserializer(new ISO8601Util()));

		deserializer = new GsonDeserialization(provider, new DefaultJsonDeserializers(deserializers), request);

=======
>>>>>>> 97d4f628bf2675efd7c06c6636b473b06d0e080b
		Object[] deserialized = deserializer.deserialize(stream, bark);

		assertThat(deserialized.length, is(1));
		assertThat(deserialized[0], is(instanceOf(Dog.class)));
		Dog dog = (Dog) deserialized[0];
```
