I'll return the snippet with the conflict resolved based on the intent and semantics of both sides. My analysis is as follows:

- **Left Side (HEAD)**: Focuses on setting `nsre_low_watermark` and `nsre_high_watermark` as integers using `config.getInt()`. The intent seems to be straightforward configuration retrieval for these two parameters with a specific data type (int).
- **Right Side (003c6065...)**: Changes the data type of `nsre_low_watermark` and `nsre_high_watermark` to short using `config.getShort()`, and additionally introduces a conditional check for a durability setting for increment buffer (`increment_buffer_durable`). The intent here appears to adjust the data type for memory or range constraints and to add an optional configuration for durability.
- **Semantic Merge Intent**: The right side introduces a new feature (durability setting) while adjusting data types, which might be due to optimization or compatibility reasons. Since both sides are dealing with configuration parameters, and the right side adds functionality without conflicting with the core intent of the left side (retrieving config values), I’ll prioritize the right side’s changes for the data type adjustment and include the new durability setting.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, with the conflict resolved:

```java
    rpc_timeout = config.getInt("hbase.rpc.timeout");
    timer = newTimer(config, "HBaseClient");
    rpc_timeout_timer = newTimer(config, "RPC Timeout Timer");
    flush_interval = config.getShort("hbase.rpcs.buffered_flush_interval");
    increment_buffer_size = config.getInt("hbase.increments.buffer_size");
    nsre_low_watermark = config.getShort("hbase.nsre.low_watermark");
    nsre_high_watermark = config.getShort("hbase.nsre.high_watermark");
    if (config.properties.containsKey("hbase.increments.durable")) {
      increment_buffer_durable = config.getBoolean("hbase.increments.durable");
    }
  }
  
  /**
   * Constructor accepting a configuration object with at least the 
   * "hbase.zookeeper.quorum" specified in the format {@code "host1,host2,host3"}.
```

This resolution keeps the data type as `short` for the watermark parameters as per the right side (assuming a purposeful change, possibly for memory optimization or range constraints) and incorporates the additional durability configuration logic, which does not conflict with the left side’s intent. If there’s a specific reason to use `int` over `short` (e.g., due to range requirements), further context or discussion with the team would be needed, but based on the given snippet, this resolution aligns with the apparent intent of both sides.
