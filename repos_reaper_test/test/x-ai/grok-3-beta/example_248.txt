I'll return the snippet with the conflict resolved based on the semantic intent. Both sides of the merge are essentially trying to achieve the same functionalityâ€”deserializing a list of `FileSpec` objects from a configuration property. The difference is purely stylistic in terms of code formatting (line breaks and indentation). I will choose the formatting from the `HEAD` side as it appears more concise, but the functionality remains identical.

Here is the entire snippet with the resolved conflict:

```java
        return (LoadFunc) PigContext.instantiateFuncFromSpec(loadFuncSpec);
    }

    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    private static String getLoadLocation(int inputIndex, Configuration conf) throws IOException {
        ArrayList<FileSpec> inputs =
            (ArrayList<FileSpec>) ObjectSerializer.deserialize(
                    conf.get(PIG_INPUTS));
        return inputs.get(inputIndex).getFileName();
    }

    /**
     * Pass loader signature to LoadFunc and to InputFormat through
```
