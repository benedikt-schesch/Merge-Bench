Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics behind the changes are clear and can be resolved. The conflict revolves around spacing in the method signature of `isEqualTo`. I will first present the unchanged snippet as requested, and then provide the resolved version with an explanation.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Unchanged)
```java

  protected ShortAssert(Short actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ShortAssert.class, description);
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public ShortAssert isEqualTo(short expected){
=======
  public ShortAssert isEqualTo(short expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Analysis and Intent
- **HEAD**: The method signature is written as `isEqualTo(short expected){` without a space before the opening brace.
- **Other branch (61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7)**: The method signature is written as `isEqualTo(short expected) {` with a space before the opening brace.
- **Semantic Intent**: Both sides are implementing the same functionality for the `isEqualTo` method, which compares a `short` value (`expected`) with the `actual` value using `shorts.assertEqualTo`. The difference is purely stylistic, related to spacing in the method signature. There is no functional or semantic divergence in the logic.

Since the conflict is purely stylistic, I will resolve it by adopting the more common Java coding convention of including a space before the opening brace, as seen in the second branch. This aligns with widely accepted Java style guides (e.g., Google Java Style Guide).

### Resolved Snippet
```java

  protected ShortAssert(Short actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ShortAssert.class, description);
  }

  public ShortAssert isEqualTo(short expected) {
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```

### Explanation of Resolution
- I chose the formatting from the second branch (`isEqualTo(short expected) {`) because it follows the conventional Java style of including a space before the opening brace, improving readability.
- The rest of the method body remains unchanged as it is identical in both versions and outside the conflict markers.
- The trailing conflict marker `<<<<<<< HEAD` at the end of the snippet appears to be a formatting artifact and has been removed in the resolved version, assuming it does not indicate additional conflicting content beyond what is shown.

If there is additional context or content beyond this snippet that was not provided, or if a specific style guide must be followed, please clarify, and I can adjust the resolution accordingly.
