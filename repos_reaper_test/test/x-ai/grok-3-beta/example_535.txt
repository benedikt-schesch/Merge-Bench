I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. Below, I'll return the snippet with the full context preserved as markdown code syntax without modifying the spacing or content. Following that, I'll provide my reasoning about the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge. Since the intent seems clear, I will propose a resolution.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Unchanged)
```java
  private CallbackContext initCallbackContext;
  private CallbackContext scanCallbackContext;
  private Object scanLock = new Object();
  private CallbackContext permissionsCallback;
  private CallbackContext locationCallback;
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

  private CallbackContext initPeripheralCallback;
  private BluetoothGattServer gattServer;
  private CallbackContext addServiceCallback;
  private CallbackContext advertiseCallbackContext;
  private boolean isAdvertising = false;
>>>>>>> 2efc89dde2658f518e6b6ca936296c207e08d65c

  //Store connections and all their callbacks
  private HashMap<Object, HashMap<Object,Object>> connections;

  //Discovery related variables
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD Side**: The HEAD side of the conflict is empty, meaning there are no additional fields or changes introduced on this branch at this specific location. The intent seems to be maintaining the existing structure without adding new variables in this section.
- **Incoming Branch (2efc89dde2658f518e6b6ca936296c207e08d65c)**: This side adds several new fields related to Bluetooth peripheral functionality, such as `initPeripheralCallback`, `gattServer`, `addServiceCallback`, `advertiseCallbackContext`, and `isAdvertising`. The intent is clearly to extend the code to support Bluetooth peripheral operations (e.g., GATT server and advertising capabilities), which are not present in the HEAD branch.

### Resolution Reasoning
Since the HEAD side does not add or modify anything in this conflicting section (it's empty), and the incoming branch introduces new functionality without overlapping or contradicting existing fields, the semantic intent is to incorporate the new fields from the incoming branch. There is no conflict in terms of overwriting or modifying shared code; it's purely an addition. Therefore, adopting the changes from the incoming branch aligns with the goal of extending the class's capabilities for Bluetooth peripheral operations.

### Resolved Snippet
```java
  private CallbackContext initCallbackContext;
  private CallbackContext scanCallbackContext;
  private Object scanLock = new Object();
  private CallbackContext permissionsCallback;
  private CallbackContext locationCallback;

  private CallbackContext initPeripheralCallback;
  private BluetoothGattServer gattServer;
  private CallbackContext addServiceCallback;
  private CallbackContext advertiseCallbackContext;
  private boolean isAdvertising = false;

  //Store connections and all their callbacks
  private HashMap<Object, HashMap<Object,Object>> connections;

  //Discovery related variables
```

### Final Notes
If there were any indication that the HEAD branch intentionally omitted these fields for a specific reason (e.g., a comment or other context not visible in the snippet), I would reconsider this resolution. However, based on the provided code and the clear intent to add peripheral functionality in the incoming branch, the resolved snippet above should correctly reflect the desired outcome. If you have additional context or concerns, please provide them, and I can revisit the resolution.
