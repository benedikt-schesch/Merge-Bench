I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and resolve it based on the intent and semantics of both sides. Below is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, as requested, followed by my analysis and resolution.

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict
- **HEAD (left side)**: Includes imports for `emptyList` and `unmodifiableList` from `java.util.Collections`. It does not include the `asList` method from `java.util.Arrays`.
- **Incoming change (right side, commit 813d480c)**: Includes the same imports as HEAD (`emptyList` and `unmodifiableList`) but additionally imports `asList` from `java.util.Arrays`.

### Intent and Semantics
- The HEAD side seems to represent the original or base version of the code, importing only the necessary `Collections` utilities.
- The incoming change adds the `asList` import, which suggests that somewhere in the codebase (likely in a later part not shown in this snippet), there is a need to convert arrays to lists using `Arrays.asList`. The intent of the incoming change is to extend the functionality by including this utility method.
- Since the HEAD side does not conflict with the addition (it simply lacks the extra import), and there are no overlapping or contradictory changes, the semantic intent of both sides can be merged by including all imports.

### Resolution
I will resolve the conflict by combining the imports from both sides, ensuring that the additional `asList` import from the incoming change is included alongside the existing imports from HEAD. This preserves the intent of both sides: maintaining the original imports and adding the new functionality.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown syntax:

package org.fest.assertions.internal;

import static java.lang.String.format;
import static java.util.Arrays.asList;
import static java.util.Collections.emptyList;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;
import static org.fest.util.Collections.isEmpty;
import static org.fest.util.Collections.nonNullElements;
import static org.fest.util.Introspection.descriptorForProperty;

import java.beans.PropertyDescriptor;
```

### Explanation of Resolution
- I included all imports from both sides of the conflict. The `asList` import from `java.util.Arrays` was added (from the incoming change), and the existing imports (`emptyList` and `unmodifiableList` from `java.util.Collections`) were retained (from HEAD).
- This resolution ensures that no functionality is lost, and the intent of the incoming change to support array-to-list conversion is fulfilled.
- The order of imports follows a logical grouping (standard Java imports first, then project-specific imports), which aligns with common Java coding conventions.
