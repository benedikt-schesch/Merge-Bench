I'll return the provided snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent of the merge is ambiguous. The conflict involves a method `showCustomizeDialog()` present in the `HEAD` branch but absent in the other branch. Without additional context about whether this method should be included or excluded, or if it was intentionally removed or added, I cannot confidently resolve the conflict.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
        AddSourceDialogFragment addSourceDialog = AddSourceDialogFragment.newInstance();
        addSourceDialog.setTargetFragment(this, 0);
        addSourceDialog.show(fm, AddSourceDialogFragment.class.getSimpleName());
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private void showCustomizeDialog() {
        FragmentManager fragmentManager = getFragmentManager();
        CustomizeFragment customizeFragment = new CustomizeFragment();
        customizeFragment.setTargetFragment(this, 0);
        customizeFragment.show(fragmentManager, CustomizeFragment.class.getSimpleName());
    }

    private class UpdateBackgroundTask extends TimerTask {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            mHandler.post(new Runnable() {
                @Override
```

If you can provide more context about the purpose of the `showCustomizeDialog()` method or the intent behind its addition or removal, Iâ€™d be happy to assist in resolving the conflict.
