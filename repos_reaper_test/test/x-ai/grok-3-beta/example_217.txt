Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict, but since the intent is ambiguous and the conflict resolution is unclear without additional context about the test setup or purpose of the `PigServer` initialization, I am returning the snippet unchanged.

```java
        assertEquals(expectedCount, count);
    }

    @Test
    public void testStringLte() throws Throwable {
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
        PigServer pig = new PigServer(initString);
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
        PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(tmpFile));
        int expectedCount = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < LOOP_COUNT; i++) {
            if(i % 5 == 0) {
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics:
- **HEAD Side**: The HEAD side of the conflict is empty, suggesting that there was no specific initialization or additional code in this test method at this point in the codebase. The intent might be to keep the test minimal or rely on external setup not shown in this snippet.
- **Commit Side (1488b22)**: This side introduces a `PigServer` object initialized with `initString`. The semantic intent appears to be setting up a PigServer instance for use in the `testStringLte` method, likely for testing purposes related to Pig (a data processing framework).

### Reason for Preserving Conflict:
The intent behind whether the `PigServer` initialization is necessary or should be omitted is unclear without broader context about the test's purpose, the `initString` variable, or the expected behavior of `testStringLte`. Resolving this conflict might require knowledge of whether the test depends on PigServer or if this initialization belongs elsewhere. Therefore, the conflict is left unresolved in the snippet above. If additional context or clarification is provided, I can assist further in resolving it.
