I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. The conflict revolves around a documentation comment referencing either `#spectator` or `#spectators`, likely indicating a variable or field name.

Based on the context and semantics, it appears the intent on both sides is to document the synchronization object used in the `removeSpectator` method. The difference between `spectator` and `spectators` suggests a possible renaming or typo correction. Since the method name `removeSpectator` implies interaction with a collection or multiple spectators (as it removes a single user from presumably a group of spectators), the term `spectators` (plural) seems more accurate semantically. This implies that the field is likely a collection, and the synchronization is on the collection of spectators.

Given this analysis, I'll resolve the conflict by choosing the version with `spectators` as it aligns better with the apparent intent of handling multiple spectators in a game.

Here is the resolved code snippet with the full context preserved exactly as provided:

```java
  }

  /**
   * Remove a spectator from the game.
   * <br/>
   * Synchronizes on {@link #spectators}.
   *
   * @param user Spectator to remove from the game.
   */
  public void removeSpectator(final User user) {
    logger.info(String.format("Removing spectator %s from game %d.", user.toString(), id));
```
