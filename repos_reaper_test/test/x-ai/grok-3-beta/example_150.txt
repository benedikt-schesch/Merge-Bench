I'll return the snippet with the resolved merge conflict based on the intent and semantics of both sides. My analysis is as follows:

- **HEAD**: Uses a simpler constructor for `GruntParser` with just a `StringReader`.
- **Branch (2125666c)**: Enhances the constructor by passing an additional `myPig` object, likely to provide context or configuration to the parser.
- **Intent**: The branch version seems to introduce additional functionality or customization through `myPig`, which is not present in HEAD. Since `myPig` is presumably a necessary parameter for the parser to work correctly in the updated codebase (as indicated by the branch), the branch's intent should take precedence to ensure compatibility with potential downstream changes.

Thus, I will resolve the conflict by adopting the branch's version.

Here is the snippet with the conflict resolved, preserving the exact spacing and context as provided:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "illustrate b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```
