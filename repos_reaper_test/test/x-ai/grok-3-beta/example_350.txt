I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet with the conflict unresolved since the intent and semantics are ambiguous without further context. Here's the code snippet exactly as provided, maintaining all spacing and context:

```java
        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "200\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
=======
    assertNull(ge.getDetails());
    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200"));
>>>>>>> 47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613
  }

  public void testFrom_withDetails() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport();
    HttpRequest request =
```

**Analysis of the Conflict:**

- **HEAD side**: This side uses `responseException` as the variable name and performs two assertions:
  1. Checks if `getDetails()` returns null.
  2. Constructs an expected message string combining HTTP status code and URL, then asserts that `getMessage()` equals this exact string.
- **47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613 side**: This side uses `ge` as the variable name (likely a typo or different naming convention) and also performs two assertions:
  1. Checks if `getDetails()` returns null (same as HEAD).
  2. Only checks if `getMessage()` starts with "200" rather than matching the full expected string.
- **Ambiguity**: The primary issue is the variable name discrepancy (`responseException` vs `ge`), which suggests a potential error or incomplete refactoring on one side. Additionally, the assertions on `getMessage()` differ in their strictness (exact match vs. prefix match), and without knowing the expected behavior of `GoogleJsonResponseException`, it's unclear which approach aligns with the intended test logic.

Since I cannot determine the correct variable name or the intended strictness of the message assertion without additional context about the test's purpose or the codebase's naming conventions, I am leaving the conflict unresolved as provided above. If further information is available (e.g., the purpose of the test or naming standards), I can assist in resolving it.
