Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including spacing and context. Following that, I will provide an explanation of the intent and semantics behind both sides of the conflict and propose a resolution.

```java
    // have to do this all synchronized in case they play while we're processing this
    synchronized (roundTimerLock) {
      killRoundTimer();

      if (state == GameState.JUDGING) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        final Map<ReturnableData, Object> data = new HashMap<ReturnableData, Object>();
=======
        final Map<ReturnableData, Object> data = new HashMap<>();
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
        data.put(LongPollResponse.EVENT, LongPollEvent.HURRY_UP.toString());
        data.put(LongPollResponse.GAME_ID, this.id);
        final QueuedMessage q = new QueuedMessage(MessageType.GAME_EVENT, data);
        getJudge().getUser().enqueueMessage(q);
      }
```

### Analysis and Resolution Explanation

**Intent and Semantics Analysis:**
- **HEAD (Left Side):** Declares a `HashMap` with explicit type parameters as `new HashMap<ReturnableData, Object>()`. This is likely from an older version of the codebase or a branch that has not yet adopted Java's diamond operator for type inference.
- **Branch (Right Side - `5adedd2481...`):** Declares the same `HashMap` using the diamond operator as `new HashMap<>()`. This is a modern Java practice (introduced in Java 7) to reduce verbosity, as the compiler can infer the type parameters from the variable declaration.

**Semantic Intent:**
- Both sides are functionally identical in terms of behavior. The difference is purely syntactic and relates to code style or Java version compatibility. The right side uses a more concise and modern syntax, while the left side uses an explicit, older style.
- There is no difference in runtime behavior or logic; both instantiate a `HashMap` with `ReturnableData` as the key type and `Object` as the value type.

**Resolution Decision:**
Since the diamond operator (`<>`) is a widely accepted modern Java practice and does not alter the semantics or functionality of the code, I recommend adopting the version from the right side (branch `5adedd2481...`). It improves readability and aligns with current coding standards, assuming the codebase is using Java 7 or later (which is almost certainly the case given typical project timelines).

**Resolved Code:**
```java
    // have to do this all synchronized in case they play while we're processing this
    synchronized (roundTimerLock) {
      killRoundTimer();

      if (state == GameState.JUDGING) {
        final Map<ReturnableData, Object> data = new HashMap<>();
        data.put(LongPollResponse.EVENT, LongPollEvent.HURRY_UP.toString());
        data.put(LongPollResponse.GAME_ID, this.id);
        final QueuedMessage q = new QueuedMessage(MessageType.GAME_EVENT, data);
        getJudge().getUser().enqueueMessage(q);
      }
```

This resolution preserves the functionality and intent of both sides while favoring modern Java syntax for better code maintenance.
