I'll analyze the merge conflict by considering the intent and semantics of both sides.

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict:

- **HEAD (Left Side):**
  - Defines `ALARM_SUPPORTED_GET = 0x06` and `ALARM_SUPPORTED_REPORT = 0x07`.
  - The intent appears to be assigning consecutive hex values for alarm-related commands, specifically for getting and reporting supported alarms.

- **dff01786de3c5fdc4121d54712819008777841ff (Right Side):**
  - Defines `ALARM_GET_SUPPORTED = 0x07` and `ALARM_SUPPORTED_REPORT = 0x08`.
  - The naming convention (`ALARM_GET_SUPPORTED`) suggests a slightly different interpretation or style for the "get" command related to supported alarms, and it assigns different hex values (non-consecutive with respect to the left side).

- **Intent and Semantics:**
  - Both sides are trying to define constants for getting and reporting supported alarms, likely for a protocol or communication system.
  - The key difference is in naming (`ALARM_SUPPORTED_GET` vs. `ALARM_GET_SUPPORTED`) and the assigned hex values (`0x06` and `0x07` vs. `0x07` and `0x08`).
  - The semantic intent is identical: both sides aim to provide constants for querying and reporting supported alarm types. The difference in hex values could cause compatibility issues if the protocol expects specific values.
  - Without additional context about the correct protocol values or naming conventions, it's unclear which set of values or naming style is correct. The hex values must align with the external system or specification.

- **Resolution Recommendation:**
  - Since I lack sufficient context to determine the correct hex values or the preferred naming convention (e.g., whether `ALARM_SUPPORTED_GET` or `ALARM_GET_SUPPORTED` is the standard), I will preserve the conflict as is for manual resolution by someone with knowledge of the protocol or style guide.
  - If I had to guess, I might lean toward merging the naming from one side and ensuring consecutive hex values, but this risks introducing errors.

### Returning the Snippet with Conflict Preserved:

As the intent and correct values are ambiguous without additional context, I will return the snippet unchanged, preserving the conflict for manual resolution.
