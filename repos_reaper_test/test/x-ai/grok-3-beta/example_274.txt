Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved in markdown code syntax, maintaining the original context and spacing exactly as provided:

```java
            } catch (PlanException e) {
                int errCode = 2029;
                String msg = "Error rewriting join package.";
                throw new MRCompilerException(msg, errCode, PigException.BUG, e);
            }
<<<<<<< HEAD

            LogFactory.getLog(LastInputStreamingOptimizer.class).info("Rewrite: POPackage->POForEach to POJoinPackage");

            mr.phyToMRMap.put(forEach, pack);
            LogFactory.getLog(LastInputStreamingOptimizer.class).info(

        }

    }

    private static class FindKeyTypeVisitor extends PhyPlanVisitor {

```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics:

- **HEAD Side:** The intent seems to be simply logging a message about the rewrite operation from `POPackage->POForEach` to `POJoinPackage`. There is no additional functional logic beyond logging.
- **88ae4a5 Side:** The intent includes not only logging a similar message (though with slightly different wording: `POPackage(JoinPackager)` instead of `POJoinPackage`), but also adding a functional operation `mr.phyToMRMap.put(forEach, pack);`, which appears to be updating a mapping between `forEach` and `pack` in some data structure (`phyToMRMap`).

### Resolution Uncertainty:
While both sides are logging a rewrite operation, the `88ae4a5` side includes additional logic that is critical to the functionality (updating the `phyToMRMap`). The HEAD side omits this logic, which might be intentional (e.g., if it was deemed unnecessary in that branch) or accidental (e.g., if the update was overlooked). The difference in log message wording also suggests potential divergence in naming conventions or intent regarding the representation of the rewrite operation.

Given the ambiguity in whether the omission of `mr.phyToMRMap.put(forEach, pack);` in HEAD is intentional or not, and without further context on the role of `phyToMRMap` or the overall design, I am unable to confidently resolve the conflict. The functional update in `88ae4a5` seems important and should likely be retained, but discarding HEAD's intent (if it deliberately excluded the update) could be incorrect.

Therefore, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact for further review or input from stakeholders who can clarify the intent behind omitting the map update in HEAD or confirm if the update in `88ae4a5` is essential. If a resolution is needed, a possible approach could be to combine the functional update from `88ae4a5` with a unified log message, but this is speculative without additional context.
