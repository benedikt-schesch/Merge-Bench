I'm returning the provided snippet with the conflict unresolved, as the intent and semantics behind the changes on both sides of the merge are ambiguous without additional context about the codebase or the purpose of the changes. Below is the original snippet, preserved exactly as provided, with no modifications to the context or spacing.

```java
                    ListRow row = findListRow(category);

                    // if found add this video
                    // if not, create a new row and add it
                    if (row != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
                        ((SortedArrayObjectAdapter) row.getAdapter()).add(video);
                    } else {
                        SortedArrayObjectAdapter listRowAdapter = new SortedArrayObjectAdapter(
=======
                        ((SortedObjectAdapter) row.getAdapter()).add(video);
                    } else {
                        SortedObjectAdapter listRowAdapter = new SortedObjectAdapter(
>>>>>>> 308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5
                                videoNameComparator, mCardPresenter);
                        listRowAdapter.add(video);

                        HeaderItem header = new HeaderItem(0, category, null);
                        mAdapter.add(0, new ListRow(header, listRowAdapter));
```

### Explanation of Ambiguity:
- **Conflicting Types:** On the `HEAD` side, the adapter is `SortedArrayObjectAdapter`, while on the `308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5` side, it is `SortedObjectAdapter`. These appear to be different classes or implementations, and it's unclear which one is intended to be used in the final codebase.
- **Lack of Context:** Without knowing the purpose of the adapter (e.g., whether sorting behavior or array-specific functionality is critical), the correct resolution cannot be determined. It’s also unclear if this change is part of a broader refactoring or a specific bug fix.
- **Semantic Intent Unclear:** Both changes seem to intend to add a `video` to a row adapter or create a new adapter if the row doesn’t exist. However, the difference in class names suggests a potential shift in design or dependencies that needs clarification.

If you can provide additional context (e.g., documentation, commit messages, or surrounding code changes), I’d be happy to resolve the conflict. For now, I’ve preserved the original snippet with the conflict markers intact.
