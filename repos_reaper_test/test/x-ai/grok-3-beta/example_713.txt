I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as provided, preserving the context and spacing. I'm also noting that the intent behind both sides of the conflict in the `play()` method seems to differ: one side focuses on directly controlling the media player to start playback, while the other side focuses on updating a playback state and delegating the handling to another method. Without further context on the overall design or purpose (e.g., whether the playback state management is part of a larger state machine or if direct control of the media player is preferred), it's ambiguous to resolve definitively.

```java
        EventBus.getDefault().register(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void play() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null && !sMediaPlayer.isPlaying())
            sMediaPlayer.start();
=======
        mPlayState = PlaybackStateCompat.STATE_PLAYING;
        handlePlayState();
>>>>>>> ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66
    }

    @Override
    public void pause() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
