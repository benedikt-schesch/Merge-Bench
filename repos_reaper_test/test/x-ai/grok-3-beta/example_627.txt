I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. The conflict arises from different testing frameworks being used in the two branches. Let's look at the intent and semantics:

- **HEAD Branch**: Uses AssertJ for assertions, which provides a more fluent and readable assertion style (e.g., `assertThat`, `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown`).
- **a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe Branch**: Uses JUnit's built-in assertions (e.g., `assert*` methods from `org.junit.Assert`).

**Intent Analysis**:
- Both branches aim to include assertion methods for unit testing.
- The choice of testing framework (AssertJ vs. JUnit assertions) appears to be a stylistic or project-standard decision rather than a functional difference.
- Since I don't have further context about the project's testing standards or dependencies, I cannot definitively resolve the conflict without risking the introduction of an incorrect dependency or breaking the build.

**Resolution Decision**:
Due to the ambiguity in project standards and lack of additional context (e.g., whether the project has fully migrated to AssertJ or prefers JUnit assertions), I will return the snippet with the conflict markers intact. This ensures that the decision can be made by someone with more context about the project's guidelines.

Here is the unchanged code snippet with the merge conflict preserved:
