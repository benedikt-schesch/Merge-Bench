Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict included, preserved exactly as given with the original spacing and context. I have also analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict and provided a resolution.

### Code Snippet with Merge Conflict (Preserved as Is)

```java
	 * @param cluster a reference to the minicluster
	 * @param localFileName the pathname of local file
	 * @param fileNameOnCluster the name with which the file should be created on the minicluster
	 * @throws IOException
	 */

     static public void copyFromLocalToCluster(MiniGenericCluster cluster,
        String localFileName, String fileNameOnCluster) throws IOException {

	static public void copyFromLocalToCluster(MiniCluster cluster, String localFileName, String fileNameOnCluster) throws IOException {
        if(Util.WINDOWS){
            localFileName = localFileName.replace('\\','/');
            fileNameOnCluster = fileNameOnCluster.replace('\\','/');
        }

        PigServer ps = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
        String script = getMkDirCommandForHadoop2_0(fileNameOnCluster) + "fs -put " + localFileName + " " + fileNameOnCluster;

	    GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));
        parser.setInteractive(false);
```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Intent and Semantics Analysis:**
- **HEAD Side (Left Side):** The `HEAD` version uses `MiniGenericCluster` as the type for the `cluster` parameter and does not include any additional logic for handling file paths. The intent seems to be maintaining a specific type for the cluster parameter, possibly aligning with a broader refactoring or type hierarchy in the codebase.
- **Branch Side (Right Side, Commit `8923da8`):** The branch version uses `MiniCluster` as the type for the `cluster` parameter and includes additional logic to handle file path separators for Windows environments by replacing backslashes (`\`) with forward slashes (`/`). The intent here is to improve compatibility with Windows systems by normalizing file paths.

**Conflict Source:** The conflict arises due to differences in the method signature (specifically, the type of the `cluster` parameter) and the additional Windows-specific logic introduced in the branch.

**Resolution Strategy:** 
- The type of the `cluster` parameter needs to be resolved. Without additional context about the codebase, it's unclear whether `MiniGenericCluster` or `MiniCluster` is the correct type. However, since `MiniCluster` is likely a more general or updated type (based on naming conventions and common refactoring patterns), I will lean toward adopting it unless `MiniGenericCluster` is explicitly required.
- The Windows path normalization logic is a valuable addition and does not conflict semantically with the rest of the method's purpose. It should be retained.
- The rest of the method body outside the conflict area appears consistent and can be kept as is.

**Resolved Code Snippet:**

```java
	 * @param cluster a reference to the minicluster
	 * @param localFileName the pathname of local file
	 * @param fileNameOnCluster the name with which the file should be created on the minicluster
	 * @throws IOException
	 */
	static public void copyFromLocalToCluster(MiniCluster cluster, String localFileName, String fileNameOnCluster) throws IOException {
        if(Util.WINDOWS){
            localFileName = localFileName.replace('\\','/');
            fileNameOnCluster = fileNameOnCluster.replace('\\','/');
        }
        PigServer ps = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
        String script = getMkDirCommandForHadoop2_0(fileNameOnCluster) + "fs -put " + localFileName + " " + fileNameOnCluster;

	    GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));
        parser.setInteractive(false);
```

**Note:** If `MiniGenericCluster` is the intended type due to specific requirements in the codebase (e.g., it being a subclass or a more specific abstraction), the type should be adjusted back to `MiniGenericCluster`. Without further context, I have prioritized the branch's type (`MiniCluster`) and its additional logic for Windows compatibility. If there are additional concerns or ambiguity in other parts of the codebase, please provide more context for a definitive resolution.
