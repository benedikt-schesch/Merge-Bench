Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as provided, along with my analysis of the intent and resolution. The context and spacing are unchanged.

```java
	 * 
	 * @param in The Resource's contents
	 * @param href The location of the resource within the epub. Example: "cover.jpg".
	 */
	public Resource(InputStream in, String href) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		this(null, IOUtil.toByteArray(in),  href, MediatypeService.determineMediaType(href));
=======
		this(null, IOUtils.toByteArray(in), href, MediatypeService.determineMediaType(href));
>>>>>>> 0d25a18153c4751a6a7e51055c740287d9c1186e
	}

    /**
     * Creates a Resource that tries to load the data, but falls back to lazy loading.
     *
```

### Analysis and Resolution:
After reviewing the merge conflict, the difference lies in the utility class used to convert the `InputStream` to a byte array:
- **HEAD** uses `IOUtil.toByteArray(in)` with an extra space before `href`.
- **Incoming branch (0d25a181)** uses `IOUtils.toByteArray(in)` with no extra space before `href`.

**Intent and Semantics:**
- Both sides aim to achieve the same functionality: converting an `InputStream` to a byte array for the `Resource` constructor.
- The difference is likely due to a dependency or library update. `IOUtil` and `IOUtils` might refer to different utility classes (possibly from different libraries or packages, e.g., Apache Commons IO for `IOUtils`).
- The spacing difference before `href` is cosmetic and does not affect functionality.

**Resolution Decision:**
Since I am not certain about the correct utility class (`IOUtil` vs. `IOUtils`) without additional context about the project's dependencies or coding standards, I will leave the conflict unresolved in the snippet above. However, if I were to resolve it, I would recommend:
1. Verify the correct utility class by checking the project's imports and dependencies.
2. If `IOUtils` is the intended or updated library (e.g., Apache Commons IO), adopt the incoming branch's change.
3. Normalize the spacing for consistency (remove the extra space before `href`).

If you have additional context about the intended library or utility class, I can refine the resolution accordingly. For now, the snippet is returned as is with the conflict markers intact.
