Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as it was given, including all context and spacing. I will also provide my analysis and resolution of the conflict based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

```java
     * you won't need special null-safe forms of methods like
     * {@link String#toUpperCase} either.
     * 
     * @param string
     *            a string reference to check
<<<<<<< HEAD
     * @return {@code true} if the string is null or is the empty string
=======
     * @return {@code true} if the string is null or is the empty string.

     */
    public static boolean isNullOrEmpty(String string) {
        return string == null || string.isEmpty();
    }
```

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict
The conflict lies in the Javadoc `@return` section of the method documentation for `isNullOrEmpty`. Let's examine the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (Left Side):** The documentation states: `@return {@code true} if the string is null or is the empty string`. This version uses `{@code true}` to highlight the boolean return value and describes the condition clearly without a trailing period.
- **Incoming Change (Right Side, commit `1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f`):** The documentation states: `@return {@code true} if the string is null or is the empty string.`. This version is identical in content to the HEAD version but adds a trailing period at the end of the sentence.

### Semantic Intent
Both sides of the conflict are semantically identical in terms of the information conveyed. The only difference is a minor stylistic choice regarding punctuation (the presence of a trailing period). The intent of both sides is clearly to document that the method returns `true` when the input string is either `null` or empty. The difference in punctuation does not alter the meaning or functionality of the documentation.

### Resolution
Since the difference is purely stylistic, I will resolve the conflict by adopting the version with the trailing period (from the incoming change) as it aligns more with conventional English grammar in documentation, where sentences typically end with a period. However, if there is a specific style guide for the project that dictates otherwise (e.g., no trailing periods in Javadoc single-line comments), the HEAD version could be retained. Without additional context about the project's style guidelines, I will proceed with the incoming change.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
     * you won't need special null-safe forms of methods like
     * {@link String#toUpperCase} either.
     * 
     * @param string
     *            a string reference to check
     * @return {@code true} if the string is null or is the empty string.
     */
    public static boolean isNullOrEmpty(String string) {
        return string == null || string.isEmpty();
    }
```

This resolution preserves the intent of both changes while applying a minor stylistic improvement for readability. If there are specific project guidelines or preferences regarding Javadoc formatting, they should override this decision.
