Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including the full context and spacing. After the snippet, I will provide my analysis and resolution of the conflict based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

```java
				new DelayModifier(2),
				new AlphaModifier(1.5f, 1, 0),
				new AlphaModifier(1.5f, 0, 1)
		);

<<<<<<< HEAD
		final SpriteGroup spriteGroup = new SpriteGroup(this.mBitmapTexture, SPRITE_COUNT);
=======
		final SpriteGroup spriteGroup = new SpriteGroup(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, SPRITE_COUNT);
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
		for(int i = 0; i < SPRITE_COUNT; i++) {
			final Sprite face = new Sprite((CAMERA_WIDTH - 32) * this.mRandom.nextFloat(), (CAMERA_HEIGHT - 32) * this.mRandom.nextFloat(), this.mFaceTextureRegion);
			face.registerEntityModifier(faceEntityModifier.clone());

			spriteGroup.attachChild(face);
```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Context and Intent Analysis:**
- The conflict arises in the initialization of the `SpriteGroup` object, specifically in the first parameter passed to its constructor.
- On the `HEAD` side, the parameter is `this.mBitmapTexture`. This suggests that the `SpriteGroup` is being initialized with a single bitmap texture, likely a raw or unmanaged texture resource.
- On the other branch (commit `91801fdd...`), the parameter is `this.mBitmapTextureAtlas`. This implies that the `SpriteGroup` is being initialized with a texture atlas, which is typically a managed collection of textures often used for optimization in game development (e.g., reducing draw calls by batching multiple sprites into a single texture).
- Semantically, both sides are trying to create a `SpriteGroup` with a texture source for rendering sprites, but they differ in how the texture is provided—either as a standalone bitmap texture (`mBitmapTexture`) or as part of a texture atlas (`mBitmapTextureAtlas`).
- Given the context (usage of `Sprite` and `SpriteGroup`, likely in a game engine like AndEngine), using a texture atlas (`mBitmapTextureAtlas`) is often the preferred approach for performance reasons, as it allows batching of sprites. However, the `HEAD` side might be using a raw texture for a specific reason (e.g., a temporary implementation, a different use case, or a simplification).

**Resolution Decision:**
- Without additional context about the project’s structure or the specific purpose of `SpriteGroup` in this codebase, the intent seems to lean toward using a texture atlas (`mBitmapTextureAtlas`) as it aligns with best practices in game development for managing multiple sprites.
- However, to respect the possibility that `HEAD` might be using `mBitmapTexture` intentionally (e.g., for a specific test or because the texture atlas isn’t yet set up), I will not definitively resolve the conflict without confirmation.
- Since the problem statement allows returning the snippet unchanged if the intent is ambiguous, and I lack sufficient surrounding code or documentation to confirm which texture source is correct, I will preserve the conflict as is for now.
- If I had to make an educated guess, I would lean toward `mBitmapTextureAtlas` from the branch, assuming it represents a later or more optimized implementation. But to avoid potential errors, I will leave the conflict markers intact.

**Resolved Snippet (Unchanged Due to Ambiguity):**
The snippet is returned as provided above, with the conflict markers preserved due to the ambiguity in intent. If additional context or clarification is provided (e.g., the purpose of `mBitmapTexture` vs. `mBitmapTextureAtlas`, or the expected behavior of `SpriteGroup`), I can revisit the resolution. For now, the original snippet with conflict markers is maintained as shown.
