I'll provide the code snippet with the conflict resolved based on the semantic intent and then explain my reasoning.

```java
 * Date: 7/17/14.
 * <p/>
 * MVP的View层，UI相关，Activity需要实现该interface
 * 它会包含一个Presenter的引用，当有事件发生（比如按钮点击后），会调用Presenter层的方法
 */
public interface ABActivityViewer extends TaskController{

    /**
     * 显示Toast信息
     *
     * @param message
```

### Explanation of Resolution:
- **Intent Analysis**: The merge conflict arises from a change in the interface declaration. On the `HEAD` side, the interface is defined simply as `ABActivityViewer`. On the other branch (`a4d77b017980dbe4d731dc090d4cd8cd3c2d9364`), the interface is extended to include `TaskController` as a parent interface.
- **Semantic Understanding**: 
  - The `HEAD` side does not specify any extension, which might indicate it is either an earlier version or a deliberate choice to not extend `TaskController`.
  - The other branch explicitly adds `extends TaskController`, suggesting an intent to include additional functionality or behavior defined in `TaskController` for the `ABActivityViewer` interface. This is likely a feature addition or a structural change to align `ABActivityViewer` with some broader design pattern or requirement (e.g., ensuring certain methods or behaviors are inherited).
- **Resolution**: I resolved the conflict by adopting the change from the branch (`extends TaskController`) because it appears to be a purposeful extension of the interface's capabilities. There is no clear evidence that removing `TaskController` (as in `HEAD`) was intentional; it is more likely that `HEAD` represents an older or unchanged version of the code. Extending interfaces is a common practice to add functionality without breaking existing implementations, and this change aligns with semantic intent to enhance the interface.
- **Risk Mitigation**: If the decision to not extend `TaskController` in `HEAD` was intentional (e.g., to avoid inheriting certain behaviors), this resolution might introduce unwanted dependencies. However, without further context or comments indicating such intent, the more progressive change (adding `TaskController`) is favored as it likely represents the desired evolution of the codebase.

If there are concerns or additional context about whether `TaskController` should be included, please provide further details, and I can revisit this resolution.
