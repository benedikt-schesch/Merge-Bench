Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and spacing, formatted in markdown code syntax. Below the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict to attempt a resolution.

```java
    static final int DIALOG_MESSAGE_CLICK = 25;
    static final int DIALOG_GOTO_PARENT = 28;
    static final int DIALOG_EDIT = 29;
    static final int DIALOG_DELETE = 30;
    static final int DIALOG_COMPOSE = 31;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    static final int DIALOG_FIND = 32;
=======
    static final int DIALOG_REPORT = 33;
    static final int DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK = 34;
    static final int DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE = 35;
>>>>>>> 5b113d182581d1ed140bc7768a508344f19d7d6e

    // progress dialogs
    static final int DIALOG_LOGGING_IN = 1000;
    static final int DIALOG_SUBMITTING = 1004;
    static final int DIALOG_REPLYING = 1005;
```

### Analysis and Resolution Attempt
Let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict:

- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The `HEAD` branch introduces a single new constant, `DIALOG_FIND = 32`, which appears to be related to a "find" functionality in a dialog context. The intent seems to be adding a new dialog type for searching or finding content.
- **Incoming Branch (Right Side, Commit `5b113d182581d1ed140bc7768a508344f19d7d6e`)**: The incoming branch introduces three new constants: `DIALOG_REPORT = 33`, `DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK = 34`, and `DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE = 35`. These appear to be related to reporting content, interacting with threads, and viewing user profiles, respectively. The intent is to add multiple new dialog types for various user interactions.

**Semantic Intent**: Both sides are attempting to extend the set of dialog-related constants by introducing new functionalities. There is no overlap in the functionalities (i.e., `DIALOG_FIND` does not conflict with `DIALOG_REPORT`, `DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK`, or `DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE` in terms of purpose). The only potential issue is the numbering of the constants, but since they are unique and sequential, they can be combined without conflict.

**Proposed Resolution**: Since the constants represent distinct functionalities and the numbers assigned to them do not overlap, the correct semantic resolution is to include all the constants from both sides. I will adjust the numbering to ensure continuity and avoid gaps or overlaps. Starting from the last agreed-upon constant (`DIALOG_COMPOSE = 31`), I will assign sequential numbers to the new constants from both sides.

Here is the resolved version of the code snippet with the conflict addressed:

```java
    static final int DIALOG_MESSAGE_CLICK = 25;
    static final int DIALOG_GOTO_PARENT = 28;
    static final int DIALOG_EDIT = 29;
    static final int DIALOG_DELETE = 30;
    static final int DIALOG_COMPOSE = 31;
    static final int DIALOG_FIND = 32;
    static final int DIALOG_REPORT = 33;
    static final int DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK = 34;
    static final int DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE = 35;

    // progress dialogs
    static final int DIALOG_LOGGING_IN = 1000;
    static final int DIALOG_SUBMITTING = 1004;
    static final int DIALOG_REPLYING = 1005;
```

**Rationale for Resolution**: 
- All new dialog types from both branches are preserved, maintaining the intent of both sides.
- The numbering remains sequential and unique, avoiding any potential conflicts in the dialog ID space.
- The context and spacing of the surrounding code are preserved as required.

If there is a specific reason (e.g., project conventions or dependencies not visible in the snippet) that certain constants should not be combined or should follow a different numbering scheme, this resolution might need adjustment. However, based on the provided snippet and semantic analysis, this resolution appears to fulfill the intent of both branches.
