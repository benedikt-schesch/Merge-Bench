Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as provided, including spacing and context. Following that, I will explain the resolution based on the semantic intent of both sides of the merge.

```java
		return new Engine(new EngineOptions(true, ScreenOrientation.LANDSCAPE, new RatioResolutionPolicy(CAMERA_WIDTH, CAMERA_HEIGHT), this.mCamera));
	}

	@Override
	public void onLoadResources() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTexture(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
=======
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d

		this.mFont = new Font(this.mFontTexture, Typeface.create(Typeface.DEFAULT, Typeface.BOLD), 22, true, Color.WHITE);

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mFontTexture);
		this.mEngine.getFontManager().loadFont(this.mFont);
```

### Resolution Explanation
After analyzing the merge conflict, the difference lies in the class used for `mFontTexture`:
- **HEAD**: Uses `BitmapTexture`
- **Other branch (91801fdd)**: Uses `BitmapTextureAtlas`

#### Semantic Intent Analysis:
- **HEAD (`BitmapTexture`)**: This suggests the intent is to use a basic bitmap texture for the font, possibly for simplicity or compatibility with an older version of the codebase or library.
- **Other branch (`BitmapTextureAtlas`)**: This suggests an intent to use a texture atlas, which is generally more efficient for managing multiple textures or sprites in a game engine (likely AndEngine, based on the context). `BitmapTextureAtlas` is often used to optimize rendering by grouping textures into a single atlas.

#### Context and Library Consideration:
- The subsequent lines of code (`this.mFont = new Font(...)`, `this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(...)`) indicate that `mFontTexture` is used as a texture source for a `Font` object and is loaded into the engine's texture manager. In AndEngine, `BitmapTextureAtlas` is the more commonly used and recommended class for such purposes, as it supports texture atlases for better performance.
- `BitmapTexture` might be a valid alternative, but it is less likely to be the desired choice for font rendering in a game engine context, where texture atlases are preferred for optimization.

#### Resolved Code:
Given the context and the likely intent to optimize rendering, I recommend adopting the change from the other branch (`BitmapTextureAtlas`), as it aligns with best practices for game engines like AndEngine.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
		return new Engine(new EngineOptions(true, ScreenOrientation.LANDSCAPE, new RatioResolutionPolicy(CAMERA_WIDTH, CAMERA_HEIGHT), this.mCamera));
	}

	@Override
	public void onLoadResources() {
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);

		this.mFont = new Font(this.mFontTexture, Typeface.create(Typeface.DEFAULT, Typeface.BOLD), 22, true, Color.WHITE);

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mFontTexture);
		this.mEngine.getFontManager().loadFont(this.mFont);
```

If there is a specific reason to use `BitmapTexture` (e.g., compatibility issues, specific requirements in the project), the resolution could be revisited. However, based on semantic intent and context, `BitmapTextureAtlas` appears to be the more appropriate choice.
