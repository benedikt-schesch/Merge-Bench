I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the resolved code while preserving the original context and spacing. My analysis is based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

- **HEAD Side**: Includes a `synchronized` keyword on the `subscribe` method and a log statement for debugging purposes, indicating an intent to ensure thread safety and provide logging for subscription events.
- **Branch Side (3714d4e47f47c4d640239dfe025a1ebf91b3b624)**: Lacks the `synchronized` modifier and the log statement, suggesting a simpler implementation without explicit thread safety or logging.

**Resolution Intent**: The HEAD side likely aims to make the method thread-safe due to the use of `synchronized`, which is important in a context where multiple threads might access the subscription list (`mSubscribers`). The logging statement also aids in debugging. The branch side does not contradict this functionality but simply omits these enhancements. Therefore, I will retain the `synchronized` modifier and the log statement from HEAD while keeping the rest of the method body intact.

Here is the resolved snippet with the original context preserved:

```java
		} catch (WifiStateException e1) {
			mInfo = null;
		}
		mSubscribers = new HashSet<Handler>();
	}
	
	public synchronized void subscribe(Handler handler) {
		Log.i("NowPlayingPoller", "Subscribing handler " + handler.getClass().getName() + " to now playing events.");
		// update handler on the state of affairs
		final ICurrentlyPlaying currPlaying = mControl.getCurrentlyPlaying(mManagerStub);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_PROGRESS_CHANGED, currPlaying);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_PLAYLIST_ITEM_CHANGED, currPlaying);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_COVER_CHANGED, currPlaying);
```
