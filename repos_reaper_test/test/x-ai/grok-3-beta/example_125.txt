Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics behind both sides of the merge conflict but have determined that the resolution is ambiguous without additional context about the intended functionality or the purpose of the classes involved. Therefore, I am returning the snippet unchanged.

```java
    return new GenericRepository<>(null, api);
  }

  @Provides
  @PerActivity
<<<<<<< HEAD
  ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase provideChangeRepositoryStarRepository() {
    return new ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase();
=======
  ChangeRepositoryStarRepository provideChangeRepositoryStarRepository() {
    return new ChangeRepositoryStarRepository();
>>>>>>> 46751d2846d926dab116569835f3660a6297da86
  }

  @Provides
  @PerActivity
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

**Explanation of Ambiguity**:  
The conflict involves two different class names and return types: `ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase` (from HEAD) and `ChangeRepositoryStarRepository` (from the commit `46751d2846d926dab116569835f3660a6297da86`). Without further context about the purpose of these classes, their relationship, or the intended functionality of the `provideChangeRepositoryStarRepository()` method, it is unclear which implementation should be chosen or if a combination of logic is required. For instance, one might be a use case for business logic, while the other might be a data repository, suggesting different layers of the application architecture. Hence, I have preserved the conflict for manual resolution by someone with deeper knowledge of the codebase.
