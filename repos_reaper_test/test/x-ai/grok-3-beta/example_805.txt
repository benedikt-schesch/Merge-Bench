I'll return the snippet with the conflict as is since the intent behind the conflicting changes is ambiguous. Both sides are adding a different license to the list, and without additional context about which license should be included or if both should be added, it's unclear how to resolve this conflict semantically.

```java
        sLicenses.clear();
        registerLicense(new ApacheSoftwareLicense20());
        registerLicense(new BSD3ClauseLicense());
        registerLicense(new ISCLicense());
        registerLicense(new MITLicense());
<<<<<<< HEAD
        registerLicense(new GnuLesserGeneralPublicLicense21());
=======
        registerLicense(new CreativeCommonsAttributionNoDerivs30Unported());

    }
