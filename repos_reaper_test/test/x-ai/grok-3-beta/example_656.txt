I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and provide the unresolved snippet as requested since the intent behind the variable names `dataItem` and `dataList` is ambiguous without further context.

```java
      totalCount = jsonSummary.get("total_count") != null ? jsonSummary.getLong("total_count", 0L) : null;
    } else {
      totalCount = null;
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    this.data = unmodifiableList(dataItem);
=======
    this.data = unmodifiableList(dataList);
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    this.facebookClient = facebookClient;
    this.connectionType = connectionType;
  }

  /**
```

**Analysis of the Conflict:**
- **Left Side (HEAD):** Uses `dataItem` as the argument to `unmodifiableList()`. This suggests that `dataItem` might be a collection or list of items intended to be made unmodifiable.
- **Right Side (a17acec):** Uses `dataList` as the argument to `unmodifiableList()`. This implies that `dataList` is likely the intended collection variable for storing the data.
- **Intent Ambiguity:** Without additional context about the surrounding code (e.g., variable declarations or method signatures), it's unclear whether `dataItem` and `dataList` refer to the same data structure with a name change or if they are entirely different variables. The semantic intent appears to be the same on both sides—creating an unmodifiable list from some data collection—but the exact variable to use cannot be determined definitively.
- **Resolution Decision:** Since the intent is ambiguous and I lack context about the variable names, I have returned the snippet with the conflict markers intact as per the instructions. If additional context (e.g., variable declarations or related code) were provided, I could resolve this by choosing the correct variable name based on the codebase's naming conventions or intended functionality.

If you can provide more context about the variables `dataItem` and `dataList`, I can assist in resolving the conflict with a concrete resolution.
