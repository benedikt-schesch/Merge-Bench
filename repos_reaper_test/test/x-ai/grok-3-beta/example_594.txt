I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and explain my approach to resolving it based on the intent and semantics of both sides. However, as requested, I will first return the snippet with the conflict unchanged in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context.

```java
    ListObject obj = new ListObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  @Test
  public void emptyFacebookMap() {
    MapObject obj = new MapObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }

  /**
   * Can we handle the empty object?
   */
  @Test
  public void emptyObject() {
```

### Analysis and Explanation

Looking at the merge conflict, I can see the following:

- **HEAD side**: This contains a test method named `emptyFacebookMap()` that tests serialization of a `MapObject` to JSON. The test checks if the JSON output matches `{"id":12345}`.
- **Incoming side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe)**: This appears to be empty in terms of new content before the conflict marker but is followed by a commented question about handling an empty object and a test method named `emptyObject()`. However, the method body is incomplete in the provided snippet.
- **Context**: The surrounding code involves JSON serialization tests for different kinds of objects (e.g., `ListObject` in the preceding code).

**Intent and Semantics**:
- The HEAD side seems to focus on testing a specific type of object (`MapObject`) with a specific name (`emptyFacebookMap`), likely tied to some domain or context-specific logic (perhaps related to Facebook data mapping).
- The incoming side introduces a more general test named `emptyObject()`, possibly aiming to test the handling of an empty or generic object. The comment `Can we handle the empty object?` suggests an intent to verify behavior with minimal or no data.
- There is ambiguity because the incoming side's test method `emptyObject()` lacks a body in the snippet, so the exact implementation or purpose (beyond handling an "empty object") is unclear.

**Resolution Decision**:
Given the ambiguity in the incoming side's test method content (since the body is not provided in the snippet) and the lack of clarity on whether `emptyFacebookMap()` and `emptyObject()` are meant to test the same functionality or serve distinct purposes, I am unable to definitively resolve the conflict without further context or clarification. For instance:
- If `emptyObject()` is meant to replace or generalize `emptyFacebookMap()`, we might discard the HEAD side.
- If both tests are necessary (one for a specific use case and one for a general case), we might keep both methods.
- However, without the full body of `emptyObject()` or additional context about the relationship between these test cases, any resolution would be speculative.

As per the instruction, since I am not sure how to resolve the conflict due to ambiguous intent, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact, as shown above. If further context or the complete code for the `emptyObject()` method is provided, I can revisit the resolution.
