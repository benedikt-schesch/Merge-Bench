I'll analyze the merge conflict in terms of intent and semantics.

Both sides are attempting to define a test case for writing data to a locked URI Beacon, with the expectation of an error due to insufficient authorization. Let's look at the differences:

- **HEAD**: Uses `ConfigUriBeacon.INSUFFICIENT_AUTHORIZATION` which seems to be a specific error code or constant representing an authorization error when writing long data to a locked beacon.
- **Branch (72bcd2216d792365c9e99dc69ee413acb1dc5b8e)**: Uses `TestData.VALID_LENGTH_AUTHORIZATION_ERRORS` which might be a broader set of error conditions or a different naming convention for expected errors related to authorization with valid length data.

The semantic intent appears to be the same: testing the behavior when attempting to write long URI data to a locked beacon, expecting an authorization-related error. The difference lies in the representation of the expected error condition.

Since the intent is clear but the exact constant or error set to use is ambiguous without further context about the codebase's naming conventions or error handling structure, I will preserve the conflict as is.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the merge conflict:

```java
                  BluetoothGatt.GATT_SUCCESS)
      );
      specUriBeaconTestsBuilder.add(
          new Builder()
              .name("Locked: Try Long Data")
