I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. The conflict is between importing `DialogInterface.OnClickListener` from the `HEAD` branch and importing `Intent` from the other branch (commit `7d80c81a`).

### Analysis of Intent
- **HEAD branch**: The import of `DialogInterface.OnClickListener` suggests that the code likely includes functionality to handle click events on a dialog, which aligns with the other imported dialog-related classes (`AlertDialog`, `ProgressDialog`, `DialogInterface`, `OnCancelListener`). This indicates the intent is to manage user interactions with dialogs.
- **Other branch (7d80c81a)**: The import of `Intent` suggests the code might involve starting new activities or passing data between components, which is unrelated to the dialog functionality but could be part of broader app navigation or interaction logic in this file.
- **Semantic Resolution**: These imports are not mutually exclusive; both can coexist as they serve different purposes. Including both imports is the safest and most logical resolution because it preserves the intent of both branchesâ€”dialog interaction and potential activity navigation or data passing.

### Resolved Code Snippet
Below is the code snippet with the merge conflict resolved by including both imports. The surrounding context remains unchanged, and the spacing is preserved as provided.

```java
import android.app.AlertDialog;
import android.app.ProgressDialog;
import android.bluetooth.le.ScanResult;
import android.content.DialogInterface;
import android.content.DialogInterface.OnCancelListener;
import android.content.DialogInterface.OnClickListener;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.support.v7.widget.LinearLayoutManager;
import android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView;
import android.text.Html;
import android.text.Spanned;
