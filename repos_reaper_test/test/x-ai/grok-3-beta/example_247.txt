Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as it was given, including all context and spacing. Following that, I will explain my reasoning for the resolution and provide the resolved version if the intent is clear.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Preserved as Is)
```java
     * @return
     * @throws IOException
     */
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    private static LoadFunc getLoadFunc(int inputIndex, Configuration conf) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        ArrayList<FileSpec> inputs =
            (ArrayList<FileSpec>) ObjectSerializer.deserialize(
                    conf.get(PIG_INPUTS));
=======
        ArrayList<FileSpec> inputs = 
                (ArrayList<FileSpec>) ObjectSerializer.deserialize(
                        conf.get(PIG_INPUTS));
>>>>>>> 1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81
        FuncSpec loadFuncSpec = inputs.get(inputIndex).getFuncSpec();
        return (LoadFunc) PigContext.instantiateFuncFromSpec(loadFuncSpec);
    }

    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
Looking at the conflicting changes:
- **HEAD Version**: The code has the initialization of `inputs` with a single-line style, where the assignment and cast are on one line, followed by the method call on indented lines.
- **Incoming Commit (1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81)**: The code splits the initialization over multiple lines with different indentation, likely for readability or to adhere to a specific coding style or formatting guideline (e.g., line length limits or team conventions).

**Semantic Intent**: Both versions achieve the exact same functionality—deserializing a configuration value into an `ArrayList<FileSpec>`. There is no difference in logic or behavior. The conflict is purely stylistic, focusing on code formatting (line breaks and indentation).

**Resolution Strategy**: Since the semantic intent is identical, the resolution can prioritize either version based on context, such as project coding standards or readability. Without additional context about the project's style guide, I will lean towards the incoming commit's formatting (from `1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81`) because it breaks the long line into multiple lines, which often improves readability, especially in environments with strict line length policies. However, if the project's style guide prefers compact code (like HEAD), that could be chosen instead. Since the intent is purely stylistic, I’ll resolve it with the incoming change.

### Resolved Snippet
```java
     * @return
     * @throws IOException
     */
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    private static LoadFunc getLoadFunc(int inputIndex, Configuration conf) throws IOException {
        ArrayList<FileSpec> inputs = 
                (ArrayList<FileSpec>) ObjectSerializer.deserialize(
                        conf.get(PIG_INPUTS));
        FuncSpec loadFuncSpec = inputs.get(inputIndex).getFuncSpec();
        return (LoadFunc) PigContext.instantiateFuncFromSpec(loadFuncSpec);
    }

    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
```

### Conclusion
The resolved version adopts the formatting from the incoming commit for improved readability through line breaks. If there are specific project guidelines or preferences for code style (e.g., compact lines as in HEAD), the resolution can be adjusted accordingly. If you have additional context about the project's coding standards, I can revisit the resolution.
