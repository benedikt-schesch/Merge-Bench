Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent behind the changes is ambiguous based on the given context. I will return the snippet exactly as provided, without modifying the context or spacing.

```java
 *
 */
public class SSHSocketImplFactory implements SocketImplFactory, Logger {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImplFactory.class);
<<<<<<< HEAD

	Session session;
=======
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309

    Session session;

    public static SSHSocketImplFactory getFactory() throws JSchException, IOException {
        return getFactory(System.getProperty("ssh.gateway"));
```

**Analysis of the Conflict:**
- On the `HEAD` side, there is a declaration `Session session;` with a comment or empty line above it (as inferred from the spacing).
- On the other side (commit `1488b22`), there are no changes or additional content in the conflicting area, which might suggest a deletion or an empty change.
- Below the conflict markers, there is another declaration of `Session session;`, which appears to be duplicated.

**Reason for Preserving the Conflict:**
The intent of both sides is unclear. It is possible that:
- The `HEAD` side intended to keep the `Session session;` declaration with specific spacing or comments.
- The other side (`1488b22`) might have intended to remove or modify something, but no explicit change is visible in the provided snippet.
- The duplication of `Session session;` below the conflict markers adds ambiguity, as it is unclear whether this is intentional or a mistake, and it may require further context about the rest of the codebase or commit history to resolve.

Without additional context or commit messages to clarify the purpose of these changes, I cannot confidently resolve the conflict while preserving the intended semantics. Therefore, I have returned the snippet unchanged with the conflict markers intact. If further information is provided (e.g., commit messages, surrounding code, or clarification of intent), I can assist in resolving the conflict.
