I'm returning the code snippet with the merge conflict resolved based on the semantic intent of both sides. Both changes are attempting to enable the accumulator optimization in Apache Pig, but they use slightly different property names. After analyzing the context and typical Pig configuration properties, I believe the correct property name is `PigConfiguration.OPT_ACCUMULATOR`, as it aligns with standard Pig configuration constants often used in such contexts. However, I will also note that if `opt.accumulator` is a valid alias or a newer naming convention in the specific version of Pig being used, it could be considered. Since the intent is clear (enable accumulator optimization), and assuming the use of `PigConfiguration.OPT_ACCUMULATOR` is more aligned with standard practices, I will resolve the conflict in favor of the `HEAD` version.

Below is the entire snippet with the conflict resolved, maintaining the original context and spacing exactly as provided:

```java
        pigServer.registerQuery("B = group A by id;");
        pigServer.registerQuery("C = foreach B generate group," +
                "org.apache.pig.test.utils.AccumulativeSumBag(A);");

        checkAccumulatorOff("C");
        pigServer.getPigContext().getProperties().setProperty(
                PigConfiguration.OPT_ACCUMULATOR, "true");
    }

    private void checkAccumulatorOff(String alias) {
        try {
            Iterator<Tuple> iter = pigServer.openIterator(alias);
```

**Note:** If `opt.accumulator` is the correct or preferred property name in your specific Pig version or codebase (e.g., due to custom configurations or newer conventions), you may want to revert to the other side of the merge. Please verify the property name in the Pig documentation or codebase to ensure correctness.
