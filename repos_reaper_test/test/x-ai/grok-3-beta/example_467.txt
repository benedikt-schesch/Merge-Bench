Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as well as my analysis of the intent and semantics behind both sides of the conflict. After careful consideration, I will attempt to resolve the conflict based on the apparent intent. If the intent remains ambiguous, I will return the snippet unchanged.

### Provided Code Snippet with Merge Conflict
```java

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        return startTomcat( port, SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, jvmRoute, null );
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        final Embedded tomcat = getTestUtils().createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );
=======
    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final SessionAffinityMode sessionAffinityMode,
            final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        final Embedded tomcat = createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );
>>>>>>> 6c5fb5474dc66d5ab104a5546f43f05b75a4aaa2
        tomcat.start();
        getManager( tomcat ).setSticky( sessionAffinityMode.isSticky() );
        return tomcat;
    }
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The method signature includes `port`, `jvmRoute`, and `loginType` as parameters. It uses a utility method `getTestUtils().createCatalina()` to create the `Embedded` tomcat instance. The intent seems to be providing a way to start a Tomcat server with some login configuration support, but it lacks the `sessionAffinityMode` parameter, which suggests it might be an older or simpler version of the method.
- **Other Branch (Right Side)**: The method signature is more comprehensive, including `port`, `sessionAffinityMode`, `jvmRoute`, and `loginType`. It directly calls `createCatalina()` (possibly a local or static method, or a refactor of the utility method). Additionally, it uses `sessionAffinityMode` to configure sticky session behavior in the `getManager(tomcat).setSticky()` call. The intent here appears to be enhancing the method to support session affinity configuration while maintaining the login type functionality.
- **Common Intent**: Both sides aim to start a Tomcat server with specific configurations (port, jvmRoute, and loginType). The right side extends this by adding support for session affinity, which is a logical enhancement and doesn't conflict with the base functionality.
- **Conflict Points**:
  1. Method signature: HEAD lacks the `sessionAffinityMode` parameter.
  2. Creation of `tomcat`: HEAD uses `getTestUtils().createCatalina()`, while the right side uses `createCatalina()`.
  3. Usage of `sessionAffinityMode`: HEAD does not have it, so the `setSticky()` call would fail without it.

### Proposed Resolution
The right side (other branch) appears to be the more complete and updated version, incorporating session affinity support while retaining the `loginType` parameter present in both versions. The `createCatalina()` vs `getTestUtils().createCatalina()` difference might reflect a refactoring, and since the right side is likely more recent, I will adopt its approach. I will resolve the conflict by adopting the right side's method signature and implementation, as it semantically includes the functionality of the HEAD version while adding the session affinity feature.

### Resolved Code Snippet
```java

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        return startTomcat( port, SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, jvmRoute, null );
    }

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final SessionAffinityMode sessionAffinityMode,
            final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        final Embedded tomcat = createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );
        tomcat.start();
        getManager( tomcat ).setSticky( sessionAffinityMode.isSticky() );
        return tomcat;
    }
```

### Conclusion
I resolved the conflict in favor of the right side (commit `6c5fb5474dc66d5ab104a5546f43f05b75a4aaa2`) because it includes an additional parameter for session affinity, which appears to be a deliberate enhancement. The HEAD version lacks this feature but does not introduce conflicting logic; it simply represents a less feature-rich version of the same method. If there are concerns about the `createCatalina()` vs `getTestUtils().createCatalina()` change, or if `SessionAffinityMode` integration is not desired, this resolution should be revisited with additional context from the broader codebase.
