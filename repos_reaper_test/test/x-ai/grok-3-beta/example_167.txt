Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given in markdown code syntax with all spacing and context unchanged. Following the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the conflict and a proposed resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Conflict Description:**
The merge conflict arises from a difference in the import statement for `ExecType` from the Apache Pig library. On the `HEAD` side, the import is `org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType`, suggesting that `ExecType` is a nested class or enum within the `PigServer` class. On the other branch (commit `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`), the import is `org.apache.pig.ExecType`, indicating that `ExecType` is a top-level class or enum directly under the `org.apache.pig` package.

**Intent and Semantics:**
- The intent on both sides is to import the `ExecType` class or enum, which is likely used elsewhere in the code to specify the execution mode of a Pig job (e.g., local or MapReduce mode).
- The difference in import paths suggests a structural change in the Pig library between versions or a refactoring where `ExecType` was moved from being a nested class inside `PigServer` to a standalone class directly under the `org.apache.pig` package (or vice versa).
- Without additional context about the Pig library version or the codebase, it is not immediately clear which import is correct. However, both sides are semantically equivalent in intent (importing `ExecType`), and the resolution depends on the correct path for the library version being used.

**Proposed Resolution:**
Since the intent is the same (to import `ExecType`), I will propose a resolution by choosing the more direct import, which is likely from the newer branch (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`), as moving a class from a nested to a top-level structure often indicates a library update or refactoring. However, I acknowledge that this choice may need verification based on the Pig library version or compilation errors.

Resolved code snippet:

```java
import java.util.Properties ;

import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobConf;
import org.apache.pig.ExecType;
import org.apache.pig.backend.datastorage.ContainerDescriptor;
import org.apache.pig.backend.datastorage.DataStorage;
import org.apache.pig.backend.datastorage.DataStorageException;
import org.apache.pig.backend.datastorage.ElementDescriptor;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.datastorage.HDataStorage;
```

**Note:** If this resolved import does not work due to library version incompatibilities or if `ExecType` is indeed nested under `PigServer` in the current codebase, the alternative import (`org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType`) should be used instead. If there is uncertainty about the correct version or path, it would be prudent to test the code with both imports or consult the library documentation or team members familiar with the codebase.

If you prefer to keep the conflict unresolved due to ambiguity, I can revert to presenting the original snippet with the conflict markers. Please let me know if you'd like me to adjust the resolution or if additional context is available to clarify the intent.
