I'll resolve this merge conflict based on the intent and semantics of both sides. The conflict is minor and relates to the initialization style of the `ArrayList`.

Here is the snippet with the conflict resolved:

```java
   *
   * @param cards Cards to convert to client data.
   * @return Client representation of {@code cards}.
   */
  private List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>> getWhiteCardData(final List<WhiteCard> cards) {
    final List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>> data = new ArrayList<>(cards.size());
    for (final WhiteCard card : cards) {
      data.add(card.getClientData());
    }
    return data;
  }
```

### Explanation:
- **Intent Analysis**: Both sides of the merge aim to initialize an `ArrayList` with an initial capacity based on `cards.size()` to optimize performance by avoiding resizing.
- **HEAD Side**: Uses a more verbose style with explicit type parameters in `new ArrayList<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>(cards.size())`.
- **Branch Side (5adedd2481...)**: Uses the diamond operator `new ArrayList<>(cards.size())`, which is a more concise and modern Java style (introduced in Java 7) for type inference.
- **Resolution**: I chose the branch side (`new ArrayList<>(cards.size())`) because it aligns with modern Java coding practices, improves readability by reducing boilerplate, and maintains the same semantic intent of initializing the list with a specific capacity. There is no functional difference between the two approaches.
