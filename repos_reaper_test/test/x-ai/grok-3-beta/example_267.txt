Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including all context and spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict and will provide a resolution explanation afterward.

```java
    }

    private DataBag createDataBag(int numBags) {
        String bagType = null;
        if (PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get() != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
               bagType = PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get().get("pig.cachedbag.type");
           }
=======
            bagType = PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get().get("pig.cachedbag.type");
        }
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a

        if (bagType != null && bagType.equalsIgnoreCase("default")) {
            return new NonSpillableDataBag();
        }
        return new InternalCachedBag(numBags);
```

### Resolution Explanation:
After analyzing the merge conflict, it is clear that the difference between the two sides (`HEAD` and the commit `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) is purely about indentation and spacing:
- On the `HEAD` side, there is an extra indent with spaces before the assignment to `bagType` and an extra closing brace indentation.
- On the `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a` side, the indentation aligns more consistently with the surrounding code.

Semantically, both sides are identical in terms of functionality: they retrieve the value of `"pig.cachedbag.type"` from `PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get()` and assign it to `bagType`. The intent on both sides is the same, and the conflict arises solely due to formatting differences.

### Resolved Code:
Since the intent and semantics are identical, the conflict can be resolved by choosing one consistent indentation style. I will adopt the indentation style from the `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a` side as it matches the surrounding code's structure more closely.

```java
    }

    private DataBag createDataBag(int numBags) {
        String bagType = null;
        if (PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get() != null) {
            bagType = PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get().get("pig.cachedbag.type");
        }

        if (bagType != null && bagType.equalsIgnoreCase("default")) {
            return new NonSpillableDataBag();
        }
        return new InternalCachedBag(numBags);
```

This resolution preserves the original intent and functionality while ensuring consistent formatting.
