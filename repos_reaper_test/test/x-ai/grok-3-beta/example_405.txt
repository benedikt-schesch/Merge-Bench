I'm returning the provided code snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as both sides of the conflict seem to achieve the same intent but with slightly different syntax. Both are trying to set the summary of an account with the player's display name if `savedInstanceState` is null, or with the saved player name from `savedInstanceState` if it exists. The difference lies in the way the API or object structure is accessed (`Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer` vs. `getGC().getCurrentPlayer()`), and without additional context about the correct API or library version being used, I cannot definitively resolve the conflict.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved, including full context, in markdown code syntax as provided:

```java
		// change for example), then the fragment's onCreate is called before
		// the new GamesClient is setup. In this case, just use the player name
		// saved in the savedInstanceState bundle
		if ((savedInstanceState == null && ((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC().isConnected())
				|| (savedInstanceState != null && savedInstanceState.containsKey("player"))) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
			account.setSummary(getString(R.string.signed_in, savedInstanceState == null ? Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer(((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC())
					.getDisplayName() : savedInstanceState.getString("player")));
=======
			account.setSummary(getString(
					R.string.signed_in,
					savedInstanceState == null ? ((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC()
							.getCurrentPlayer().getDisplayName() : savedInstanceState
							.getString("player")));

		final SharedPreferences prefs = getActivity().getSharedPreferences("pedometer",
				Context.MODE_MULTI_PROCESS);
