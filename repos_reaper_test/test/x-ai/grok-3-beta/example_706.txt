I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict resolved based on the intent and semantics of both sides. It appears that the branch `5e4c2091dc2827219ba601937e8686bcb90bae78` intends to add additional imports necessary for Android-specific functionality and application context, which are likely required for the functionality in this file. The `HEAD` side does not introduce any conflicting or alternative imports, so it seems safe to include the additional imports from the branch.

Here is the resolved snippet with full context preserved in markdown code syntax:

```java

import org.json.JSONArray;
