I'll provide the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent and semantics of the changes are ambiguous based on the provided code. The conflict appears to be around the `requestLocationAction` method, but there is not enough information to determine the intended outcome of the merge (e.g., whether there's a functional difference or additional changes that aren't shown). Below is the original snippet preserved in markdown code syntax with full context and spacing unchanged.

```java
        result = true; //Probably better to default to true
      }
    }

    return result;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  }

  private void requestLocationAction(CallbackContext callbackContext) {
    locationCallback = callbackContext;

    Intent intent = new Intent(android.provider.Settings.ACTION_LOCATION_SOURCE_SETTINGS);
    cordova.startActivityForResult(this, intent, REQUEST_LOCATION_SOURCE_SETTINGS);

  }

  private void requestLocationAction(CallbackContext callbackContext) {
    locationCallback = callbackContext;


```

If you can provide additional context or clarify the intent of the changes on both sides of the merge (e.g., what was intended in the `HEAD` and the other branch), I would be happy to assist in resolving the conflict. For now, I am returning the snippet unchanged due to the ambiguity.
