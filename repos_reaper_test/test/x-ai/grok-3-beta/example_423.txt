Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context, spacing, and formatting. After the snippet, I will provide my analysis and attempt to resolve the conflict based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

```java
import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.metadata.schema.OClass;
import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.metadata.schema.OSchema;
import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.metadata.schema.OType;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
```

### Analysis and Resolution Attempt

Let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict to resolve it.

- **HEAD (Current Branch)**: This side includes imports for `com.orientechnologies.orient.core.sql.query.OSQLSynchQuery`, `org.jbake.launcher.SystemExit`, and `org.jbake.model.DocumentAttributes`. The intent appears to be focused on using OrientDB's synchronous query mechanism (`OSQLSynchQuery`) and leveraging specific JBake model attributes (`DocumentAttributes`) along with a utility for system exit handling (`SystemExit`).

- **Incoming Branch (1b5691ad2a7d734321d0382e71743a85835556b3)**: This side includes only the import for `org.jbake.model.DocumentModel`. The intent seems to be centered on using a different or possibly newer abstraction in the JBake model (`DocumentModel`), potentially replacing or consolidating other model-related imports.

### Semantic Intent
Both sides are working with the JBake framework and OrientDB, likely for a database-driven content management or static site generation system. The conflict arises from different choices in importing JBake model-related classes:
- `DocumentAttributes` (HEAD) might represent a specific set of attributes or metadata for documents in JBake.
- `DocumentModel` (incoming) might be a broader or refactored representation of a document, possibly encompassing attributes and other data.

Additionally, HEAD includes imports for OrientDB query handling (`OSQLSynchQuery`) and a system exit utility (`SystemExit`), which are absent in the incoming branch. This suggests that HEAD might be implementing specific query logic or error handling that the incoming branch does not require or has abstracted differently.

### Resolution Strategy
Since the imports from HEAD (`OSQLSynchQuery`, `SystemExit`, `DocumentAttributes`) and the incoming branch (`DocumentModel`) do not directly conflict in terms of functionality (they are different imports), the safest and most semantically coherent resolution is to include all unique imports from both sides. This preserves the intent of both branches:
- Retain `OSQLSynchQuery` and `SystemExit` from HEAD as they are likely needed for specific functionality.
- Retain `DocumentAttributes` from HEAD and `DocumentModel` from the incoming branch, as they might represent different aspects or versions of the document model in JBake (or one might be deprecated in favor of the other, though without further context, we cannot assume this).

### Resolved Code Snippet
Here is the resolved version of the code snippet with the conflict addressed by merging all unique imports:

```java
import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.metadata.schema.OClass;
import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.metadata.schema.OSchema;
import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.metadata.schema.OType;
import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.record.impl.ODocument;
import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.sql.executor.OResultSet;
import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.sql.query.OSQLSynchQuery;
import org.jbake.launcher.SystemExit;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentAttributes;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes;
import org.jbake.model.ModelAttributes;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
```

### Final Note
If `DocumentAttributes` and `DocumentModel` are mutually exclusive (e.g., one is a refactored replacement for the other), further context from the codebase or commit history would be needed to determine which to keep. Without such context, I have included both to avoid potential breakage. If this resolution causes compilation issues or redundancy, it can be revisited with additional information about the intended usage of these classes.
