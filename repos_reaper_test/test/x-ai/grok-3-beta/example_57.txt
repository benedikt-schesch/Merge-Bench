I'll analyze the merge conflict to understand the intent of both sides and provide the resolved code snippet. Let's look at the differing parts:

- **HEAD** branch checks if the total count of white cards is less than the required count and returns `false` if so, otherwise returns `true`. This is a two-step explicit logical flow.
- **Incoming branch (5adedd...)** directly returns the result of the comparison `tempWhiteDeck.totalCount() >= getRequiredWhiteCardCount()`. This is more concise, achieving the same logical outcome with a single boolean expression.

**Semantic Analysis**: Both sides aim to ensure that there are enough white cards to proceed. The logic is identical in intent: return `true` only if the white card count meets or exceeds the required count, and `false` otherwise. The difference is stylisticâ€”one is verbose, and the other is concise. Since the intent is the same, I'll resolve it by choosing the more concise version for better readability, which is the incoming branch's approach.

Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict resolved, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
      if (tempBlackDeck.totalCount() < MINIMUM_BLACK_CARDS) {
        return false;
      }

      final WhiteDeck tempWhiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
      return tempWhiteDeck.totalCount() >= getRequiredWhiteCardCount();
    }
  }

  /**
