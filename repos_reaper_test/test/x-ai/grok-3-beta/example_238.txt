I'm returning the provided code snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent and semantics of the changes on both sides of the merge are ambiguous. The conflict appears to be related to licensing information or comments, but there is no clear content provided in either branch (`HEAD` or the commit `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) to determine what was intended to be added, removed, or modified in this section. Without additional context or content in the conflicting regions, it's not possible to make an informed resolution.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved, formatted in markdown as provided:
