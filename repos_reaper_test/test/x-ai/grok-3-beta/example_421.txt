I'll resolve this conflict by analyzing the intent of both sides. The `HEAD` side includes a call to `oven.setupPaths();` which appears to be a necessary step before `oven.bake();` is called. The other side (commit `1b4df424bf08d98e85eab0c3f6e7e29a5832b07c`) doesn't include this line, likely because it was added later in the `HEAD` branch. Since the rest of the code after the conflict is identical on both sides, the intent seems to be to ensure the paths are set up before baking. Therefore, I'll keep the `oven.setupPaths();` line from `HEAD` in the resolved code.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved:

```java
      // TODO: Smells bad. A lot
      Orient.instance().startup();

      // TODO: At some point, reuse Oven
      Oven oven = new Oven(createConfiguration());

      oven.setupPaths();

      oven.bake();
      if (failOnError && !oven.getErrors().isEmpty()) {
          throw new MojoFailureException("Baked with " + oven.getErrors().size() + " errors. Check output above for details!");
      }
```
