Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved in its original form including context and spacing, followed by my analysis and resolution.

```java
        // splits.
        NoopFilterRemover fRem = new NoopFilterRemover(plan);
        fRem.visit();

        boolean isMultiQuery =
<<<<<<< HEAD
            "true".equalsIgnoreCase(pc.getProperties().getProperty(PigConfiguration.OPT_MULTIQUERY, "true"));
=======
                "true".equalsIgnoreCase(pc.getProperties().getProperty("opt.multiquery","true"));
>>>>>>> 1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81

        if (isMultiQuery) {
            // reduces the number of MROpers in the MR plan generated
            // by multi-query (multi-store) script.
            MultiQueryOptimizer mqOptimizer = new MultiQueryOptimizer(plan, pc.inIllustrator);
```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Intent and Semantics:**
- The conflict revolves around how the property for multi-query optimization is accessed in the configuration.
- On the `HEAD` side, the property is accessed using a constant `PigConfiguration.OPT_MULTIQUERY` with a default value of `"true"`.
- On the other side (`1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81`), the property is accessed using a hardcoded string `"opt.multiquery"` with a default value of `"true"`.
- Both sides aim to achieve the same functionality: checking if multi-query optimization is enabled by reading a configuration property and defaulting to `true` if the property is not set.
- The key difference is in the way the property key is defined (constant vs. hardcoded string). Using a constant (as in `HEAD`) is generally preferred as it avoids typos, improves maintainability, and ensures consistency across the codebase.

**Resolution:**
Since the intent of both sides is identical (to determine if multi-query optimization is enabled), and the `HEAD` version uses a more robust and maintainable approach with a constant, I will resolve the conflict by adopting the `HEAD` version. The hardcoded string in the other branch is likely a legacy or less standardized way of accessing the property.

**Resolved Code Snippet:**

```java
        // splits.
        NoopFilterRemover fRem = new NoopFilterRemover(plan);
        fRem.visit();

        boolean isMultiQuery =
            "true".equalsIgnoreCase(pc.getProperties().getProperty(PigConfiguration.OPT_MULTIQUERY, "true"));

        if (isMultiQuery) {
            // reduces the number of MROpers in the MR plan generated
            // by multi-query (multi-store) script.
            MultiQueryOptimizer mqOptimizer = new MultiQueryOptimizer(plan, pc.inIllustrator);
```

This resolution preserves the semantic intent of checking for multi-query optimization while using the better practice of referencing a configuration constant. If there is a specific reason to use the hardcoded string (e.g., compatibility with older configurations), further context or documentation would be needed, but based on the given information, the `HEAD` version appears to be the more appropriate choice.
