I'll return the provided code snippet exactly as it is, since there appears to be a merge conflict that needs to be resolved. My analysis of the intent and semantics suggests that the conflict involves the presence or absence of an `@AfterEach` method for verifying workspace interactions. However, as the intent behind removing or keeping this method is ambiguous without further context (e.g., whether the test cleanup is necessary or if it was intentionally removed), I will preserve the conflict markers and the original formatting.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the conflict intact:

```java
	void inContext() {
		workspace = mock(WorkspaceFacade.class);
		processor = new ClassFileChangeProcessor(workspace);
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	@AfterEach
	void verifyWorkspace() {
		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

	@Test
	void shouldNotRespondToPreBuildEvents() {
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, PRE_BUILD, AUTO_BUILD, null);
		assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event));
```
