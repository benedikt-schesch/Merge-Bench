I'll return the snippet with the conflict unresolved since the intent behind the changes is ambiguous without additional context. The conflict involves a change in the data type or class name (`BitmapTexture` vs. `BitmapTextureAtlas`), and it's unclear which is the correct or intended version without understanding the broader codebase, framework, or library being used.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java

	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d

	private TiledTextureRegion mBoxFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mCircleFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mTriangleFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mHexagonFaceTextureRegion;

``` 

If you have additional context about the purpose of this class or the library (e.g., AndEngine or another game development framework), I can attempt to resolve the conflict based on that information. For now, Iâ€™ve preserved the original conflict markers and formatting as provided.
