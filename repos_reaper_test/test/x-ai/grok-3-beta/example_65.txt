Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, along with my analysis and resolution based on the semantic intent of both sides of the merge. I will first present the original snippet with full context unchanged, followed by my reasoning and the resolved code if applicable.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Unmodified)
```java
  public List<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>> getWhiteCards(final User user) {
    // if we're in judge mode, return all of the cards and ignore which user is asking
    if (state == GameState.JUDGING) {
      return getWhiteCards();
    } else if (state != GameState.PLAYING) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      return new ArrayList<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>>();
=======
      return new ArrayList<>();
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
    } else {
      // getPlayerForUser synchronizes on players. This has caused a deadlock in the past.
      // Good idea to not nest synchronizes if possible anyway.
      final Player player = getPlayerForUser(user);
      synchronized (playedCards) {
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **Context**: This method `getWhiteCards` returns a list of white cards based on the game state and the user requesting the cards. The conflict arises in the branch where the game state is not `PLAYING` (and not `JUDGING`), in which case an empty list is returned.
- **HEAD Side (`return new ArrayList<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>>();`)**: This explicitly specifies the full generic type of the `ArrayList`, matching the return type of the method `List<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>>`. The intent here seems to be clarity or adherence to strict typing, possibly to avoid raw type warnings or ensure type safety in older Java versions or stricter compiler settings.
- **Other Side (`return new ArrayList<>();`)**: This uses the diamond operator (`<>`), which infers the generic type from the context (the return type of the method). The intent here is likely modernization or conciseness, taking advantage of Java 7+ features to reduce boilerplate code while maintaining type safety through inference.
- **Semantic Intent**: Both sides aim to return an empty `ArrayList` of the correct generic type. The difference is purely stylisticâ€”one is verbose with explicit typing, and the other is concise with type inference. There is no functional difference between the two, as both will result in the same runtime behavior and type safety (assuming Java 7 or later, which is likely given the use of the diamond operator in the other branch).

### Resolution
Since the semantic intent is identical (return an empty list of the correct type), I will resolve the conflict by prioritizing the more modern and concise syntax using the diamond operator (`<>`), as it aligns with current Java best practices for readability and reduces unnecessary verbosity. This choice assumes the codebase is using Java 7 or later, which is a safe assumption given the presence of the diamond operator in the conflicting branch.

### Resolved Snippet
```java
  public List<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>> getWhiteCards(final User user) {
    // if we're in judge mode, return all of the cards and ignore which user is asking
    if (state == GameState.JUDGING) {
      return getWhiteCards();
    } else if (state != GameState.PLAYING) {
      return new ArrayList<>();
    } else {
      // getPlayerForUser synchronizes on players. This has caused a deadlock in the past.
      // Good idea to not nest synchronizes if possible anyway.
      final Player player = getPlayerForUser(user);
      synchronized (playedCards) {
```

### Final Note
If there is a specific project requirement or style guide mandating explicit type declarations (e.g., for older Java compatibility or strict linting rules), the `HEAD` version (`new ArrayList<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>>();`) could be retained instead. However, without such context, the resolved version using `new ArrayList<>();` is the preferred choice for modern Java development.
