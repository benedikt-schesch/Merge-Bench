I'll return the snippet with the conflict unresolved since the intent behind the differing values for `nodeCount` and `relCount` is ambiguous. Without additional context or documentation about what these numbers represent or why they have changed (e.g., whether they are test data, expected results, or constants tied to a specific version of the system), I cannot determine which set of values is correct or if a different resolution is needed.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, formatted as requested:

```java
	@Test
	public void testRebuildCommand() {

		final Console console = new Console(securityContext, ConsoleMode.JavaScript, Collections.emptyMap());

<<<<<<< HEAD
		final int nodeCount           = 1834;
		final int relCount            = 2840;
=======
		final int nodeCount           = 1854;
		final int relCount            = 2898;
>>>>>>> cad117dce3ee314fe51d4648bd8c6cf07aeb0c87
		final int resourceAccessCount = 0;
		final int typedNodeCount      = 669;

		final String fullIndexRebuildOutput =
			"Node type not set or no entity class found. Starting (re-)indexing all nodes\r\n" +
```

If you can provide more context about the purpose of these values or the changes made in either branch, Iâ€™d be happy to assist in resolving the conflict.
