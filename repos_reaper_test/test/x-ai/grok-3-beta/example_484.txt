I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet with the conflict as is, since the intent behind the conflicting changes is not entirely clear without additional context. The conflict involves an import statement for `VertexBufferObjectManager` on one side, and no additional import on the other. Both sides might have valid reasons for including or excluding this import, depending on whether the class is used in the codebase.

Here is the original snippet with the merge conflict preserved:

```java
import org.andengine.engine.options.resolutionpolicy.RatioResolutionPolicy;
import org.andengine.entity.primitive.Line;
import org.andengine.entity.scene.Scene;
import org.andengine.entity.scene.background.Background;
import org.andengine.entity.util.FPSLogger;
<<<<<<< HEAD

import org.andengine.opengl.vbo.VertexBufferObjectManager;

import org.andengine.ui.activity.SimpleBaseGameActivity;

/**

 * (c) 2011 Zynga Inc.
```

### Analysis:
- **Left Side (HEAD):** No additional import is added, suggesting that the `VertexBufferObjectManager` might not be needed or was intentionally omitted.
- **Right Side (e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885):** Adds an import for `VertexBufferObjectManager`, indicating that it might be required for rendering or managing vertex buffers in the game engine context.

### Reasoning for Not Resolving:
The intent is ambiguous without further context about whether `VertexBufferObjectManager` is used in the codebase. If it is required for some functionality (e.g., rendering or sprite management in AndEngine), the import should be kept. If it is unused, it should be omitted to avoid unnecessary dependencies. Since I lack visibility into the rest of the code, I cannot make a definitive decision on the resolution. If you can provide more context or confirm the usage of `VertexBufferObjectManager`, I can assist in resolving the conflict.
