Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context, spacing, and markdown syntax:

```java
import android.graphics.Point;
import android.util.AttributeSet;
import android.util.Log;
import android.view.*;
import android.view.GestureDetector.OnGestureListener;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import android.view.MotionEvent;
import android.view.SurfaceHolder;
import android.view.SurfaceView;
=======
>>>>>>> 7b3abc7c4acdc932013594693c54a0725a72fbac
import android.widget.Scroller;
import com.sigseg.android.view.InputStreamScene;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
```

**Analysis and Reasoning for Preserving the Conflict:**

After reviewing the merge conflict, I have decided to preserve it as is due to the ambiguity in the intent of both sides of the merge. Below is my reasoning:

1. **Left Side (HEAD):** The `HEAD` side includes imports for `MotionEvent`, `SurfaceHolder`, and `SurfaceView`. These imports suggest functionality related to handling touch events (`MotionEvent`) and rendering or displaying content on a surface (`SurfaceHolder` and `SurfaceView`). This could indicate an intent to work with custom views or graphics rendering in an Android application, likely involving a `SurfaceView` for drawing or game-related purposes.

2. **Right Side (7b3abc7c4acdc932013594693c54a0725a72fbac):** The right side has no additional imports in the conflict section (it's empty except for the merge marker). This could imply that the commit on this side either removed these imports intentionally (possibly because they were unused or refactored out) or that there was no change needed in this section.

3. **Ambiguity in Intent:** Without further context about the purpose of the code or the changes made in commit `7b3abc7c4acdc932013594693c54a0725a72fbac`, it's unclear whether the imports from `HEAD` should be retained or discarded. Retaining them might be necessary if the code still relies on these classes for touch handling or surface rendering. Discarding them might be correct if they are no longer needed due to refactoring or code cleanup in the other branch.

4. **Semantic Merge Resolution Not Possible:** A semantic merge would require understanding whether the functionality associated with `MotionEvent`, `SurfaceHolder`, and `SurfaceView` is still relevant in the merged codebase. Since this information is not available in the provided snippet or conflict markers, resolving this conflict would be speculative.

Therefore, I am returning the snippet unchanged with the conflict markers intact. If more context (such as the rest of the code, commit messages, or purpose of the changes) is provided, I can attempt a more informed resolution. For now, manual intervention or additional information is recommended to resolve this conflict accurately.
