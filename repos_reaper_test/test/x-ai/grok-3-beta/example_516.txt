Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including all spacing and context. I will also provide an analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the conflict to propose a resolution.

### Analysis and Resolution

**Intent and Semantics of Both Sides:**

1. **HEAD (Left Side):**
   - Uses `mBitmapTexture` as the texture object.
   - Calls `clearTextureSources()` to clear existing texture sources.
   - Uses `BitmapTextureRegionFactory` to create a tiled texture from an asset.
   - References asset files directly as `"face_box_tiled.png"` and `"face_circle_tiled.png"` (no subfolder).
   - The intent appears to be toggling between two texture representations (box and circle) for a visual element, clearing the old texture before loading a new one.

2. **Other Branch (Right Side, commit `91801fdd...`):**
   - Uses `mBitmapTextureAtlas` as the texture object.
   - Calls `clearTextureAtlasSources()` to clear existing texture sources.
   - Uses `BitmapTextureAtlasTextureRegionFactory` to create a tiled texture from an asset.
   - References asset files with a subfolder path: `"gfx/face_box_tiled.png"` and `"gfx/face_circle_tiled.png"`.
   - The intent is similar to the HEAD side—toggling between two texture representations—but it seems to be using an updated or different texture management system (`TextureAtlas`) and updated asset paths.

**Key Differences:**
   - Variable name: `mBitmapTexture` vs. `mBitmapTextureAtlas`.
   - Method name: `clearTextureSources()` vs. `clearTextureAtlasSources()`.
   - Factory class: `BitmapTextureRegionFactory` vs. `BitmapTextureAtlasTextureRegionFactory`.
   - Asset path: Direct file name vs. prefixed with `"gfx/"`.

**Semantic Merge Resolution:**
The intent on both sides is clear: toggle between two textures (box and circle) for a visual element by clearing the old texture and loading a new one. The differences likely stem from a refactoring or update in the texture management system (e.g., moving from a simple `BitmapTexture` to a more complex `BitmapTextureAtlas`) and a change in asset organization (adding a `gfx/` folder).

Without additional context about which texture system is current or intended, I will assume the right side (`91801fdd...`) represents a more recent update or refactoring due to the use of `TextureAtlas`, which often indicates a shift to a more optimized texture management approach in game engines or graphical applications (like AndEngine, which seems relevant here based on the naming conventions). Additionally, the `gfx/` prefix in asset paths suggests an updated project structure. However, to ensure correctness, adopting the right side's code seems safer as it might reflect a broader change in the codebase.

**Proposed Resolution:**
I will resolve the conflict by adopting the right side's changes, assuming they reflect the updated or intended texture system and asset structure.

```java
	// ===========================================================
	// Methods
	// ===========================================================

	private void toggle() {
		this.mBitmapTextureAtlas.clearTextureAtlasSources();
		this.mToggleBox = !this.mToggleBox;
		BitmapTextureAtlasTextureRegionFactory.createTiledFromAsset(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, this, this.mToggleBox ? "gfx/face_box_tiled.png" : "gfx/face_circle_tiled.png", 0, 0, 2, 1);
	}

	// ===========================================================
	// Inner and Anonymous Classes
	// ===========================================================
```

**Note:** If the assumption about the right side being the updated version is incorrect, or if `mBitmapTextureAtlas` and its associated factory are not defined or appropriate in the current context, the resolution should be revisited. In such a case, additional context about the surrounding code (e.g., variable declarations, texture system in use) would be necessary to make an informed decision. If you have doubts or further context, I can adjust the resolution accordingly. For now, the resolved snippet is provided based on the analysis of intent.
