Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and spacing. After presenting the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge to attempt a resolution.

```java
    if (compatFields != null && fields == null) {
      fields = new ArrayList<SubscriptionField>();
      for (String field : compatFields) {
        fields.add(new SubscriptionField(field));
      }
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    } else if (compatFields == null && fields != null) {
      compatFields = new ArrayList<String>();
      for (SubscriptionField subscriptionField : fields) {
        compatFields.add(subscriptionField.getName());
      }
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    }
  }

  public static class SubscriptionField extends AbstractFacebookType {
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **HEAD (Left Side):** The HEAD side does not include any additional logic beyond the initial `if` block. The intent appears to be maintaining the original behavior where only the conversion from `compatFields` to `fields` is handled (i.e., populating `fields` with `SubscriptionField` objects based on `compatFields` if `fields` is null). There is no attempt to handle the reverse scenario.
  
- **Incoming Change (Right Side, commit `a17acec`):** The incoming change introduces an `else if` branch to handle the reverse scenario. If `compatFields` is null but `fields` is not, it populates `compatFields` with strings derived from the `getName()` method of each `SubscriptionField` in `fields`. The intent here is to provide bidirectional compatibility between `compatFields` (likely a legacy or string-based representation) and `fields` (a more structured representation using `SubscriptionField` objects).

- **Combined Intent:** Both sides are likely working towards maintaining compatibility between two representations of fields (`compatFields` as a list of strings and `fields` as a list of `SubscriptionField` objects). The HEAD side focuses on converting from `compatFields` to `fields`, while the incoming change adds the reverse conversion from `fields` to `compatFields`. The semantics suggest a need for synchronization between the two lists to ensure consistency, which is only partially handled in HEAD but fully addressed in the incoming change with the additional `else if` block.

### Resolution

Since the incoming change adds functionality that does not conflict with the HEAD side and aligns with the apparent intent of maintaining bidirectional compatibility between `compatFields` and `fields`, the resolution should incorporate the additional logic from the incoming change. There are no conflicting modifications to the existing code in HEAD, and the `else if` block is a logical extension of the existing `if` block.

Here is the resolved version of the code snippet with the full context preserved:

```java
    if (compatFields != null && fields == null) {
      fields = new ArrayList<SubscriptionField>();
      for (String field : compatFields) {
        fields.add(new SubscriptionField(field));
      }
    } else if (compatFields == null && fields != null) {
      compatFields = new ArrayList<String>();
      for (SubscriptionField subscriptionField : fields) {
        compatFields.add(subscriptionField.getName());
      }
    }
  }

  public static class SubscriptionField extends AbstractFacebookType {
```

This resolution ensures that both conversion directions are handled, preserving the intent from both sides of the merge. If there is additional context or constraints (e.g., `getName()` not being a valid method or other side effects of modifying `compatFields`), this resolution might need revisiting, but based on the provided snippet, this appears to be the intended behavior.
