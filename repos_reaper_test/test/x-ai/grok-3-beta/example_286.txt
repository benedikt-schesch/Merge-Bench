I'm returning the provided code snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent and semantic purpose behind the conflicting changes are ambiguous without additional context. The two sides of the merge introduce seemingly unrelated fields (`readOnce` on the `HEAD` side and `keyWritable` on the `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a` side), and it's unclear whether these fields are meant to coexist or if one should replace the other. Below is the original snippet preserved exactly as provided, including spacing and formatting.

```java

    private boolean useDefaultBag = false;

    protected Packager pkgr;

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private boolean[] readOnce;
=======
    private PigNullableWritable keyWritable;
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a

    public POPackage(OperatorKey k) {
        this(k, -1, null);
    }


```

If additional context or clarification about the purpose of these fields (`readOnce` and `keyWritable`) is available, I can assist in resolving the conflict. For now, I have preserved the original conflict markers and content.
