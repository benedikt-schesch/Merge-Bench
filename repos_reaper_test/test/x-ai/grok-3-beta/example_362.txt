Let's analyze the merge conflict and resolve it based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict

- **HEAD (Left Side)**: This version uses `authSubTransport.buildGetRequest()` to create an HTTP request and adds a parser using `authSubTransport.addParser(AuthKeyValueParser.INSTANCE)`. The intent seems to be creating a request using a pre-configured transport and then customizing it by adding a parser.
- **f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b (Right Side)**: This version uses `authSubTransport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(new GenericUrl(...))` to create the HTTP request and adds the parser directly to the request using `request.addParser(AuthKeyValueParser.INSTANCE)`. The intent appears to be using a more explicit way of creating the request with a `GenericUrl` and associating the parser directly with the request object.

### Semantic Intent
Both sides are trying to achieve the same goal: create an HTTP GET request to the URL `"https://www.google.com/accounts/AuthSubTokenInfo"`, add a specific parser (`AuthKeyValueParser.INSTANCE`), and execute the request to retrieve token information. The difference lies in the approach to creating and configuring the request:
- The HEAD version modifies the transport object by adding a parser, then builds the request.
- The right side builds the request directly using a request factory and associates the parser with the request object.

### Resolution Strategy
The right side (`f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b`) appears to be a more modern or explicit way of constructing the request using `GenericUrl` and directly associating the parser with the request. This approach is likely more modular and aligns with newer API design patterns (e.g., associating configurations like parsers with the request rather than the transport). Therefore, I will resolve the conflict by adopting the right side's approach.

### Resolved Code Snippet
Below is the entire snippet with the conflict resolved, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
   * @throws HttpResponseException if the authentication response has an error code
   * @throws IOException some other kind of I/O exception
   */
  public TokenInfoResponse requestTokenInfo() throws IOException {
    HttpTransport authSubTransport = this.authSubTransport;
    HttpRequest request = authSubTransport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(
        new GenericUrl("https://www.google.com/accounts/AuthSubTokenInfo"));
    request.addParser(AuthKeyValueParser.INSTANCE);
    return request.execute().parseAs(TokenInfoResponse.class);
  }

  /** Updates the authorization headers. */
  private void updateAuthorizationHeaders() {

```

### Rationale
I chose the right side's approach because it directly associates the parser with the request, which is semantically clearer and avoids modifying the transport object (which might have broader implications). This resolution maintains the intent of both changes: creating a GET request to the specified URL with the necessary parser for handling the response. If there are specific reasons to prefer modifying the transport (e.g., reusing the transport configuration elsewhere), the HEAD version might be reconsidered, but without additional context, the right side's approach appears more targeted and appropriate.
