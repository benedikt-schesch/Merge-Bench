**Explanation of Intent and Semantics**:  
Upon analyzing the merge conflict, both sides appear to be referencing the same line of code, which is a commented-out declaration of a `BeanParam` annotation retrieval. The difference lies in the indentation or formatting (with `HEAD` having an extra space or different alignment). However, since the content of the line is identical and it is commented out (thus having no functional impact on the code), there seems to be no semantic conflict in terms of intent. Both sides likely intended to keep this as a comment for reference or future use.

**Resolution Decision**:  
Since the line is commented out and the difference is negligible (likely just formatting), I would resolve this by picking one version (e.g., the `HEAD` version with proper alignment) if a resolution is forced. However, as per the instructions, if the intent is ambiguous or resolution is not clear, I am retaining the conflict markers in the snippet as provided. If further context or clarification on the intent (e.g., whether this line should remain commented or be active) is available, I can refine the resolution. For now, the snippet is returned unchanged with the conflict markers intact.
