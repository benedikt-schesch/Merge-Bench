Below is the snippet of code with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as provided, including the full context and spacing. Following the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the intent and semantics to propose a resolution for the merge conflict.

```java
import org.spout.api.geo.LoadOption;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.WorldSource;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Block;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
=======
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
>>>>>>> cc0703054530b4eeda07a2b1b619ed34e1e7d201
import org.spout.api.util.StringUtil;

/**
 * Represents a position in a World
 */
```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Intent and Semantics:**
- **HEAD (Left Side):** Imports `org.spout.math.vector.Vector3`. This likely indicates a dependency on a `Vector3` class from a `math.vector` package for handling 3D coordinates or vectors, which aligns with the context of representing a position in a world (as per the comment at the bottom of the snippet).
- **Other Branch (Right Side - Commit cc070305...):** Imports `org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region` and `org.spout.api.math.Vector3`. This side includes an additional import for `Region`, which might be relevant for spatial grouping or area management within the world. It also uses a slightly different path for `Vector3` (`api.math` instead of `math.vector`), suggesting a potential refactoring or restructuring of the package names in this branch.

**Conflict Analysis:**
- The conflict arises from differing imports for `Vector3` and the additional import of `Region` on the right side.
- Semantically, both sides likely intend to use a `Vector3` class to represent 3D positions (given the context of "Represents a position in a World"). The difference in package names for `Vector3` (`math.vector` vs. `api.math`) suggests a possible namespace change or versioning difference between the branches.
- The `Region` import on the right side might indicate additional functionality or context that is relevant to the code in that branch, but it is not present in the HEAD branch.

**Proposed Resolution:**
- I will assume that the correct `Vector3` import should align with the most recent or intended package structure. Given that the right side uses `org.spout.api.math.Vector3`, which seems to fit into the broader `api` namespace used by other imports (like `org.spout.api.geo.*`), it might reflect a newer or refactored structure. However, without explicit knowledge of the codebase's evolution, I will err on the side of caution and include both `Vector3` imports to avoid breaking dependencies (though typically, only one should be used, and any conflits in usage would need to be resolved in the actual code).
- The `Region` import from the right side will be retained since it does not conflict with HEAD and may be necessary for the functionality introduced in that branch.

Therefore, the resolved snippet with the conflict markers removed and the imports combined is as follows:

```java
import org.spout.api.geo.LoadOption;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.WorldSource;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Block;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.util.StringUtil;

/**
 * Represents a position in a World
 */
```

**Note:** If only one `Vector3` import is intended (which is likely), the developer should verify which package is correct based on the codebase's structure and remove the other. Since the intent behind the package difference is ambiguous without further context, both are included to ensure no dependency is missed. If there is a clear policy or standard in the project for the `Vector3` package, that should be followed instead.
