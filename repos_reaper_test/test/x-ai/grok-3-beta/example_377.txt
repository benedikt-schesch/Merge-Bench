Below is the snippet with the merge conflict preserved as provided, along with my analysis and resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge. I will return the entire snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context or spacing.

```java
  static {
    try {
      IS_WINDOWS =
          StandardSystemProperty.OS_NAME.value().toLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH).startsWith("windows");
    } catch (Throwable ex) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      Logger.getLogger(FileDataStoreFactory.class.getName()).severe(ex.getMessage());
=======
      // Logger.getLogger(FileDataStoreFactory.class.getName()).severe(ex.getMessage());
      ex.printStackTrace();
      System.out.println("*********************************************************");
      System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
>>>>>>> 6209970654c0b8d65624d98e1b49da29a99ee356
      throw ex;
    }
  }

  /** Directory to store data. */
```

### Analysis and Resolution
**Intent and Semantics Analysis:**
- **HEAD (Left Side):** The intent here appears to be logging the error message using a `Logger` at the `severe` level. This is a more formal and production-ready approach to error logging, as it uses a logging framework which can be configured for different environments (e.g., log levels, output destinations).
- **Incoming Change (Right Side, commit `6209970654c0b8d65624d98e1b49da29a99ee356`):** The intent here seems to be debugging or detailed error reporting. It comments out the original logging line (indicating awareness of the `Logger` approach) and adds `ex.printStackTrace()` for a full stack trace in the console, along with additional `System.out.println` statements for emphasis and visibility of the error message. This approach is less formal and more suited for development or debugging purposes.

**Conflict Resolution Rationale:**
The conflict arises because the two approaches to error handling are different in style and purpose:
- HEAD prioritizes a clean, production-ready logging mechanism.
- The incoming change prioritizes detailed debugging output, likely temporarily introduced for troubleshooting.

Since the incoming change comments out the original `Logger` line (indicating it might be temporary or experimental) and adds debugging output, the semantic intent seems to be enhancing visibility of errors during development. However, retaining production-ready logging is important for long-term maintainability. A resolved approach should combine the benefits of both: maintain the formal logging mechanism while optionally including additional debug output if that's the intent.

Without explicit context on whether the debugging output is temporary or permanent, I will resolve the conflict by combining both approaches. This preserves the formal logging from HEAD while incorporating the detailed output from the incoming change for debugging purposes. If the debug output is temporary, it can be removed later.

**Resolved Code Snippet:**
```java
  static {
    try {
      IS_WINDOWS =
          StandardSystemProperty.OS_NAME.value().toLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH).startsWith("windows");
    } catch (Throwable ex) {
      Logger.getLogger(FileDataStoreFactory.class.getName()).severe(ex.getMessage());
      // Additional debug output for troubleshooting
      ex.printStackTrace();
      System.out.println("*********************************************************");
      System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
      throw ex;
    }
  }

  /** Directory to store data. */
```

This resolution ensures that:
- The formal logging mechanism (`Logger.severe`) is preserved for production use.
- The debug output (`printStackTrace` and `System.out.println`) is included for troubleshooting, with a comment indicating its purpose.
- The original intent of both sides is respected by not discarding either approach.

If the debug output is not intended to be permanent, it can be removed or commented out in a future commit. If there is additional context suggesting that only one approach should be used, I would be happy to revisit this resolution.
