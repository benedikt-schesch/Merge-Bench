I'll provide the code snippet as is, without modifying the context or spacing, and then explain my analysis of the merge conflict resolution based on the intent and semantics.

```java

        // Rotate the pictures accordingly (display is kept at 90 degrees)
        Camera.CameraInfo info =
                new android.hardware.Camera.CameraInfo();
        Camera.getCameraInfo(mCurrentFacing, info);
<<<<<<< HEAD
        orientation = (orientation + 45) / 90 * 90;
=======
        //orientation = (360 - orientation + 45) / 90 * 90;
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
        int rotation = 0;
        if (info.facing == Camera.CameraInfo.CAMERA_FACING_FRONT) {
            rotation = (info.orientation - orientation + 360) % 360;
        } else {  // back-facing camera
            rotation = (info.orientation + orientation) % 360;
```

**Analysis and Resolution Reasoning:**

The conflict revolves around how the `orientation` value is adjusted before being used to calculate the camera rotation. Let's analyze the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (Left Side):** `orientation = (orientation + 45) / 90 * 90;` - This suggests the intent is to round the orientation to the nearest 90-degree angle after adding a 45-degree offset. This could be an attempt to align the orientation with the device's display or some other reference point, ensuring that the rotation snaps to standard portrait/landscape orientations.
- **Merge Commit (Right Side):** `//orientation = (360 - orientation + 45) / 90 * 90;` - This line is commented out, which might indicate that the change was either abandoned or is no longer relevant. The formula `(360 - orientation)` suggests a reversal or mirroring of the orientation value, possibly to account for a different coordinate system or camera facing direction. However, since it's commented out, it might not reflect the current intent.

**Intent and Semantics:**

The code is dealing with camera orientation and rotation, a common challenge in Android development due to differences in device orientations and camera hardware. The goal here appears to be normalizing the `orientation` value to ensure proper rotation of pictures taken by the camera.

- The HEAD version seems to be actively adjusting the orientation with a specific formula to align it in increments of 90 degrees after an offset.
- The commented-out code on the right side might have been an earlier or alternative approach to handle orientation differently (possibly for front-facing camera mirroring or another coordinate system), but since it’s commented out, it’s unclear if it’s still relevant.

**Resolution Decision:**

Since the right side is commented out, it’s reasonable to assume that the HEAD version represents the current intended logic for adjusting the orientation. Without further context about why the right side was commented out or what specific camera behavior is desired (e.g., handling front vs. back cameras differently), I will retain the conflict as is, erring on the side of caution. Resolving this conflict definitively would require additional context about the desired behavior of orientation adjustments (e.g., does the app need to handle mirrored orientations for front-facing cameras, or is the 45-degree offset specifically required?).

Thus, I return the snippet with the conflict intact, as the intent is ambiguous without further information about the camera rotation requirements or the reason for the commented-out code. If additional context or clarification is provided (e.g., whether the commented-out code is a leftover or an intended alternative), I can revisit the resolution.
