Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including spacing and context. After the snippet, I will provide an explanation of the intent and semantics behind both sides of the conflict and propose a resolution if possible.

```java
	/**
	 * Remove the node u from the binary search tree
	 * @param u
	 */
	protected void remove(Node u) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		if (u.left == null || u.right == null) {
=======
		if (u.right == nil) {
>>>>>>> 2729e32788bc1fe1d320a3ba0e5fe5a7bddc630a
			splice(u);
		} else {
			Node w = u.right;
			while (w.left != nil) 
				w = w.left;
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **HEAD Version (`if (u.left == null || u.right == null) {`)**: The intent here seems to be checking whether the node `u` is a leaf or has only one child (either left or right is `null`). In a binary search tree (BST), if a node has at most one child, it can be directly spliced out (removed by connecting its parent to its single child, if any). This condition covers two cases: (1) `u` is a leaf (both children are `null`), or (2) `u` has exactly one child (either left or right is `null`).

- **Other Branch (`if (u.right == nil) {`)**: The intent here appears to be a narrower check, only considering whether the right child of `u` is `nil` (likely a sentinel or null-equivalent value in the context of this BST implementation). This condition would trigger splicing only if the right child is absent, ignoring the presence or absence of the left child. Additionally, it uses `nil` instead of `null`, which suggests a difference in naming conventions or sentinel usage in the implementation.

- **Semantic Difference**: The HEAD version has a broader condition for splicing (either child missing), which aligns with standard BST deletion logic for nodes with 0 or 1 child. The other branch's condition is more restrictive (only checking the right child), which might indicate a specific intent or an incomplete change (possibly a typo or oversight). Furthermore, the use of `nil` vs. `null` indicates a possible inconsistency in the codebase's naming or sentinel handling.

- **Surrounding Context**: The `else` branch (unchanged in the conflict) handles the case where the node has two children by finding the successor (smallest node in the right subtree). This suggests that the `if` condition is meant to handle the simpler cases (0 or 1 child), reinforcing that the HEAD version's logic is more complete. Also, the `while (w.left != nil)` in the `else` branch uses `nil`, which matches the other branch's convention, hinting at a possible codebase-wide use of `nil` as a sentinel.

### Proposed Resolution

Given the analysis, the HEAD version's condition (`u.left == null || u.right == null`) seems to better align with standard BST deletion semantics, as it correctly handles nodes with 0 or 1 child. The other branch's condition (`u.right == nil`) is too restrictive and likely incorrect or incomplete, as it ignores the possibility of a node having only a left child. However, the use of `nil` in the other branch and in the surrounding context suggests that the codebase might use `nil` as the sentinel value instead of `null`.

To resolve this, I propose adopting the broader condition from HEAD but aligning the sentinel naming with the rest of the code (using `nil` instead of `null`):

```java
	/**
	 * Remove the node u from the binary search tree
	 * @param u
	 */
	protected void remove(Node u) {
		if (u.left == nil || u.right == nil) {
			splice(u);
		} else {
			Node w = u.right;
			while (w.left != nil) 
				w = w.left;
```

This resolution combines the correct logical intent (checking for 0 or 1 child) with the consistent use of `nil` as seen in the surrounding code. If `nil` is not the intended sentinel (e.g., if it's a typo or if `null` is used elsewhere), this should be verified with the broader codebase or team. If there is uncertainty about whether `nil` or `null` is the correct sentinel, or if the other branch's narrower condition was intentional for a specific reason, further context or discussion with the team would be needed.

Since I have provided a clear resolution based on the most likely intent, I will not return the unresolved conflict snippet. However, if this resolution is not acceptable or further clarification is needed, the original conflict snippet can be revisited.
