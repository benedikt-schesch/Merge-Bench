I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict resolved by analyzing the intent and semantics of both sides. Here's the full context preserved as is, with my resolution of the conflict.

```java
      // message tags not in Graph API 2.5 format, ignore this exception and try another way
    }

    try {
      JsonObject rawMessageTagsObject = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(rawMessageTags, JsonObject.class);
      for (String key : getNames(rawMessageTagsObject)) {
        String tagArrayString = rawMessageTagsObject.get(key).toString();
        messageTags.addAll(jsonMapper.toJavaList(tagArrayString, MessageTag.class));
      }
      return;
    } catch (FacebookJsonMappingException je) {
```

### Explanation of Resolution:
- **Intent Analysis**: The merge conflict shows two approaches to iterate over the keys of `rawMessageTagsObject`. The `HEAD` version uses `rawMessageTagsObject.names()` directly, while the `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` version uses a method `getNames(rawMessageTagsObject)`.
- **Semantics**: The intent on both sides is to retrieve the keys (names) of the `JsonObject` to iterate over them. The difference lies in how this is achieved. Using `getNames()` suggests a helper method or abstraction that might handle edge cases or provide a more maintainable approach, while `names()` is a direct call likely tied to the specific implementation of `JsonObject`.
- **Resolution**: I chose the version from `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` (`getNames(rawMessageTagsObject)`) because it likely represents an intentional refactoring or abstraction for better maintainability or consistency across the codebase. If `getNames()` is a custom utility or wrapper, it might include additional logic or safety checks that `names()` does not provide. Without contradicting context, this seems to align with a more modern or intentional design choice. If this assumption is incorrect (e.g., `getNames()` doesn't exist or isn't appropriate), the original `names()` can be restored.
