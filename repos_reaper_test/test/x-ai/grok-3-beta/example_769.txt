Let's resolve the merge conflict by analyzing the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

### Analysis of the Conflict
- **HEAD**: This side reads `nsre_low_watermark` and `nsre_high_watermark` as `int` using `config.getInt()`.
- **003c60654636b9b3dc2f3a0846a8a76a44f1fb06**: This side reads `nsre_low_watermark` and `nsre_high_watermark` as `short` using `config.getShort()`. Additionally, it introduces logic to check for a configuration property `hbase.increments.durable` and sets `increment_buffer_durable` as a boolean if the property exists.

### Intent and Semantics
- **Data Type for Watermarks**: The conflict in data type (`int` vs `short`) for `nsre_low_watermark` and `nsre_high_watermark` suggests a possible optimization or constraint on the value range. Since `short` has a smaller range than `int`, using `short` might indicate an intent to restrict values or save memory. However, without additional context about the expected range of these values or system constraints, itâ€™s safer to retain the more general `int` type to avoid potential overflow issues, unless there is a clear reason to use `short`.
- **Additional Configuration**: The branch `003c60654636b9b3dc2f3a0846a8a76a44f1fb06` introduces a new configuration check for `hbase.increments.durable`, which is not present in `HEAD`. This suggests an intent to add new functionality or customization related to durability of increments, which should be preserved as it does not conflict with the existing logic.

### Resolution
I will resolve the conflict by:
1. Retaining `int` as the data type for `nsre_low_watermark` and `nsre_high_watermark` (from `HEAD`) to prioritize safety and compatibility.
2. Including the additional logic for `hbase.increments.durable` (from `003c60654636b9b3dc2f3a0846a8a76a44f1fb06`) since it represents new functionality that does not conflict with the existing code.

Here is the resolved code snippet with full context preserved:

```java
    rpc_timeout = config.getInt("hbase.rpc.timeout");
    timer = newTimer(config, "HBaseClient");
    rpc_timeout_timer = newTimer(config, "RPC Timeout Timer");
    flush_interval = config.getShort("hbase.rpcs.buffered_flush_interval");
    increment_buffer_size = config.getInt("hbase.increments.buffer_size");
    nsre_low_watermark = config.getInt("hbase.nsre.low_watermark");
    nsre_high_watermark = config.getInt("hbase.nsre.high_watermark");
    if (config.properties.containsKey("hbase.increments.durable")) {
      increment_buffer_durable = config.getBoolean("hbase.increments.durable");
    }
  }
