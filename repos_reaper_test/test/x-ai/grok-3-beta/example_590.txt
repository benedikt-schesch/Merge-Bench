I'll analyze the merge conflict semantically and provide the original snippet as is, followed by my resolution reasoning.

Here is the original code snippet with the conflict, preserved exactly as provided:

```java
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.isBlank;
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.trimToEmpty;
import static com.restfb.util.UrlUtils.urlEncode;
import static java.util.Arrays.asList;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
import com.restfb.json.ParseException;
=======
import com.restfb.exception.*;
import com.restfb.json.JsonException;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Map.Entry;
import java.util.Set;
```

### Analysis and Resolution Reasoning:
- **HEAD Side**: Imports `com.restfb.json.JsonObject` and `com.restfb.json.ParseException`. The intent seems to be focused on handling JSON parsing with a specific exception type (`ParseException`) for error handling related to JSON processing.
- **Other Side (a17acec)**: Imports `com.restfb.exception.*` (all exceptions in the package), `com.restfb.json.JsonException`, and `com.restfb.json.JsonObject`. The intent here appears to be broader, covering all possible exceptions from the `exception` package while also explicitly importing `JsonException` (possibly for specific handling) alongside `JsonObject`.

**Semantic Intent**: 
- Both sides need `JsonObject` for JSON processing, which is common and non-conflicting.
- The conflict lies in the exception handling strategy: HEAD uses `ParseException`, while the other side uses `JsonException` and a wildcard for all exceptions in `com.restfb.exception.*`.
- It's likely that `ParseException` and `JsonException` serve similar purposes (handling JSON parsing errors), but they might belong to different versions or refactoring states of the library. The wildcard import on the other side suggests an intent to cover a broader range of exceptions.

**Resolution**: Since the wildcard `com.restfb.exception.*` on the other side would likely include both specific exceptions (if they exist in the same package), and to avoid ambiguity or potential compilation issues due to exception name clashes or version changes, I'll combine the imports to preserve the intent of both sides. I'll include the wildcard for broader coverage (from the other side) and explicitly import `JsonObject` (common to both). I'll avoid explicitly importing specific exception classes unless their usage is clear in the broader code context (which isn't provided), as the wildcard should cover them.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.isBlank;
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.trimToEmpty;
import static com.restfb.util.UrlUtils.urlEncode;
import static java.util.Arrays.asList;

import com.restfb.exception.*;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Map.Entry;
import java.util.Set;
```

### Note:
If there are specific uses of `ParseException` or `JsonException` in the codebase that require explicit imports (due to distinct handling logic), this resolution might need adjustment based on the actual code usage. Without that context, I've prioritized the broader exception coverage via the wildcard import to align with the apparent intent of the `a17acec` branch while maintaining the shared need for `JsonObject`. If this resolution doesn't work due to specific exception handling needs, the original conflict snippet should be revisited with additional context.
