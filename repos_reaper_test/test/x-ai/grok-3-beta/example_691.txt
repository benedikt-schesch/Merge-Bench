Below is the unchanged snippet of code with the merge conflict preserved as provided, along with my analysis of the intent and semantics. I will return the snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context or spacing.

```java
	public static final Property<String> dialogTextProperty  = new StringProperty("dialogText").hint("Dialog Text").partOfBuiltInSchema();

	public static final Property<String> successNotificationsProperty        = new StringProperty("successNotifications").hint("Notifications after successful execution of action").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successNotificationsPartialProperty = new StringProperty("successNotificationsPartial").hint("CSS selector for partial to display as success notification").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successNotificationsEventProperty   = new StringProperty("successNotificationsEvent").hint("Event to raise for success notifications").partOfBuiltInSchema();
<<<<<<< HEAD
	public static final Property<Integer> successNotificationsDelayProperty  = new IntProperty("successNotificationsDelay").hint("Delay before hiding success notifications").defaultValue(5000).partOfBuiltInSchema();

	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsProperty        = new StringProperty("failureNotifications").hint("Notifications after failed execution of action").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsPartialProperty = new StringProperty("failureNotificationsPartial").hint("CSS selector for partial to display as failure notification").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsEventProperty   = new StringProperty("failureNotificationsEvent").hint("Event to raise for failure notifications").partOfBuiltInSchema();

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **Context and Surrounding Code**: The provided snippet is part of a class defining various `Property` objects related to dialog and notification configurations. There are properties for success notifications (with attributes like delay, partial, and event) and failure notifications (with similar attributes). The properties are consistently defined with hints and are part of a built-in schema, suggesting a structured configuration or metadata system for an application.

- **Conflict Details**:
  - **First Conflict (successNotificationsDelayProperty)**: The `HEAD` branch includes a property definition for `successNotificationsDelayProperty`, which specifies a delay before hiding success notifications with a default value of 5000 (presumably milliseconds). The other side of the merge (`d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5`) has no content for this line, indicating either a deletion or that this property was not present in that branch.
  - **Second Conflict (empty line or additional content)**: There is a second conflict marker at the end of the snippet in `HEAD` with an empty line, which might indicate a formatting difference or an incomplete snippet on one side of the merge.

- **Intent Analysis**:
  - The `HEAD` branch likely intends to introduce or retain a configuration for the delay of success notifications, which is a logical extension of the other notification properties (e.g., `successNotificationsEventProperty`). This property fits semantically with the theme of controlling notification behavior.
  - The other branch (`d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5`) appears to omit this property, which could mean it was either deliberately removed or never included in that branch. Without additional context, it's unclear whether this omission is intentional (e.g., deprecated functionality) or simply a result of parallel development where this feature was not yet added.
  - The second conflict marker with an empty line in `HEAD` is ambiguous. It might indicate a difference in formatting or additional code that was not included in the provided snippet.

- **Resolution Reasoning**: Given the semantic consistency of the `successNotificationsDelayProperty` with other notification-related properties, and the lack of explicit intent to remove it on the other branch (no deletion comment or alternative implementation), I would lean towards retaining the property from `HEAD`. However, since the intent of the other branch is not fully clear (e.g., was the omission deliberate?), and the second conflict marker introduces ambiguity, I will refrain from resolving the conflict at this time. Resolving this would require additional context about the purpose of the branch `d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5` or confirmation from stakeholders.

As a result, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact, as provided, to ensure no assumptions are made without sufficient information. If further context or clarification is provided, I can revisit the resolution.
