I'm going to analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. The conflict revolves around the version of the Facebook API being used in the `DefaultFacebookClient` constructor.

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD (Current branch)**: Uses `Version.VERSION_2_5`, which indicates an intent to utilize a newer version of the Facebook API for this test. This might be due to new features, bug fixes, or compatibility requirements introduced in version 2.5.
- **Incoming branch (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe)**: Uses `Version.VERSION_2_2`, suggesting a preference or necessity to stick with an older version of the API. This could be due to stability, compatibility with other parts of the codebase, or specific behavior in version 2.2 that is relied upon.

### Resolution Consideration
The semantic intent of both sides is to initialize a `DefaultFacebookClient` with a specific API version for posting an image to a page's photos. The difference lies in the API version, which could affect the behavior of the API calls (e.g., available features, parameter handling, response structure). Without additional context about why each version was chosen (e.g., whether the test explicitly needs to run on a specific version or if one version introduces breaking changes), it's ambiguous to decide definitively. However, in most cases, using a newer API version is preferred unless there are known issues or compatibility constraints.

Given the lack of explicit documentation or comments in the provided snippet indicating why a specific version was chosen, I will lean towards the newer version (`Version.VERSION_2_5`) as it likely includes updates or improvements. If this is incorrect, the conflict should be revisited with more context from the developers or project requirements.

### Resolved Snippet
Below is the code snippet with the conflict resolved, opting for `Version.VERSION_2_5`:

```java

  @Test
  public void postImageToPagePhotosWithMessage() {
    byte[] imageAsBytes = fetchBytesFromImage();
    DefaultFacebookClient client =
        new DefaultFacebookClient(getTestSettings().getPageAccessToken(), Version.VERSION_2_5);
    JsonObject obj = client.publish(getTestSettings().getPageId() + "/photos", JsonObject.class,
      BinaryAttachment.with("test.png", imageAsBytes, "image/png"), Parameter.with("message", "TestImage"),
      Parameter.with("no_story", "true"));
    assertNotNull(obj);
  }

```

### Note
If there is a specific reason to use `Version.VERSION_2_2` (e.g., the test is meant to validate behavior on an older API version, or version 2.5 introduces breaking changes), this resolution should be reconsidered. If further context is available, I can adjust the resolution accordingly. For now, the snippet is resolved with the newer API version based on the assumption of forward compatibility.
