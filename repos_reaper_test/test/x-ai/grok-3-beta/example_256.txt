I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unresolved, as the intent of the changes on both sides of the merge is ambiguous. The `HEAD` side includes a configuration for `isMultiQuery`, while the other side (commit `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) appears to have removed or omitted this line, but without further context or comments, it's unclear whether this removal was intentional or if additional changes were meant to be included. Below is the original snippet with the conflict markers preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax as provided.

```java
    public PigServer(PigContext context, boolean connect) throws ExecException {
        this.pigContext = context;
        currDAG = new Graph(false);

        aggregateWarning = "true".equalsIgnoreCase(pigContext.getProperties().getProperty("aggregate.warning"));
<<<<<<< HEAD
        isMultiQuery = "true".equalsIgnoreCase(pigContext.getProperties()
                .getProperty(PigConfiguration.OPT_MULTIQUERY, "true"));
=======
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a

        jobName = pigContext.getProperties().getProperty(
                PigContext.JOB_NAME,
                PigContext.JOB_NAME_PREFIX + ":DefaultJobName");
```
