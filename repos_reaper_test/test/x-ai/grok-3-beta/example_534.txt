I will return the provided code snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent behind the changes in the conflicting lines is ambiguous. The conflict appears to be related to spacing or formatting (extra blank lines), but without additional context or clear evidence of intent, it’s not possible to determine whether the extra whitespace is meaningful or if one side should take precedence.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved, formatted exactly as provided:

```java
public class ReliefFilter {
	// 浮雕效果函数
	public static Bitmap changeToRelief(Bitmap mBitmap) {        
		 int mBitmapWidth = 0;
		 int mBitmapHeight = 0;
<<<<<<< HEAD

		 mBitmapWidth = mBitmap.getWidth();
		 mBitmapHeight = mBitmap.getHeight();
		 
		 Bitmap bmpReturn = Bitmap.createBitmap(mBitmapWidth, mBitmapHeight, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888); 
```

If further context or clarification about the intent of the changes becomes available (e.g., whether the whitespace is intentional or a formatting artifact), I can assist in resolving the conflict.
