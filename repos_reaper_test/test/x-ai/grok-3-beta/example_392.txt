Let me analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. I'll preserve the context exactly as provided and resolve the conflict based on the semantic intent of both sides.

Looking at the conflict:
- The `HEAD` side uses `@BeforeEach` (JUnit 5) and initializes `updatedFiles` as a `List` using `newArrayList()` (likely from Guava).
- The other side (commit `ee249315`) uses `@Before` (JUnit 4) and defines `updatedFiles` as a `HashSet` with a `throws IOException` clause.

Semantically, the intent seems to be setting up a test method with initialization logic. The difference lies in the JUnit version and the data structure used for `updatedFiles`. Since the surrounding context does not show the declaration of `updatedFiles`, I'll assume it should be consistent with the rest of the codebase. The choice of JUnit version also seems significant, and JUnit 5 (`@BeforeEach`) is likely the more modern approach that the `HEAD` is aiming for. The `throws IOException` on the other side might indicate a specific test requirement but isn't reflected in the rest of the visible code.

Given that `HEAD` appears to be aligning with a newer JUnit version and the data structure difference isn't critical in the visible context, I'll lean towards the `HEAD` version but note that if `updatedFiles` is expected to be a `HashSet` elsewhere, it might need adjustment post-merge.

Here is the resolved code snippet with the full context preserved as is:

```java
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586
	private DefaultInfinitestCore core;
	private ChangeDetector changeDetector;
	private TestDetector testDetector;

	@BeforeEach
	void inContext() {
		updatedFiles = newArrayList();
		core = new DefaultInfinitestCore(mock(TestRunner.class), new ControlledEventQueue());
		
		changeDetector = mock(ChangeDetector.class);
		when(changeDetector.findChangedFiles()).thenReturn(updatedFiles);
		core.setChangeDetector(changeDetector);
```
