Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I will also provide an explanation of the intent and semantics behind both sides of the conflict and propose a resolution.

```java
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      playerNames.add(player.getUser().getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.PLAYERS, playerNames);

<<<<<<< HEAD
    final User[] spectatorsCopy = spectators.toArray(new User[spectators.size()]);
    final List<String> spectatorNames = new ArrayList<String>(spectatorsCopy.length);
=======
    final User[] spectatorsCopy = spectators.toArray(new User[0]);
    final List<String> spectatorNames = new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length);
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
    for (final User spectator : spectatorsCopy) {
      spectatorNames.add(spectator.getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.SPECTATORS, spectatorNames);
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

The merge conflict involves two differences in the initialization of an array and a list for handling spectator data:

1. **Array Initialization for `spectatorsCopy`**:
   - **HEAD**: `spectators.toArray(new User[spectators.size()])` explicitly specifies the size of the array based on the size of the `spectators` collection. This ensures that the array is exactly the right size, which can be more memory-efficient and explicit in intent.
   - **Branch (5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a)**: `spectators.toArray(new User[0])` uses a zero-length array, which is a common idiom in Java to let the `toArray()` method determine the size dynamically. This is less explicit about size but avoids the need to know the collection size ahead of time and is often used for brevity.

   **Semantic Intent**: Both approaches aim to create an array of `User` objects from the `spectators` collection. The HEAD version prioritizes explicit sizing for clarity or optimization, while the branch version uses a more concise, idiomatic approach.

2. **List Initialization for `spectatorNames`**:
   - **HEAD**: `new ArrayList<String>(spectatorsCopy.length)` uses the older, explicit generic type declaration with `String` and specifies the initial capacity of the list based on the array length. This can optimize memory allocation by pre-sizing the list.
   - **Branch**: `new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length)` uses diamond operator syntax (`<>`) for type inference, a modern Java feature that reduces verbosity. It also specifies the initial capacity.

   **Semantic Intent**: Both aim to create a list of `String` objects with an initial capacity matching the array length. The difference is purely stylistic, with the branch using a more modern syntax.

### Proposed Resolution

I propose resolving the conflict by combining the best of both intents:
- For the array initialization, I suggest using `new User[0]` from the branch as it is a widely accepted idiom in Java for `toArray()` calls, and it avoids the extra call to `spectators.size()`. It is concise and achieves the same result.
- For the list initialization, I suggest using the branch's modern diamond operator syntax (`<>`) for readability and consistency with modern Java practices, while retaining the explicit capacity for optimization.

Here is the resolved snippet (though I preserve the original above as requested):

```java
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      playerNames.add(player.getUser().getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.PLAYERS, playerNames);

    final User[] spectatorsCopy = spectators.toArray(new User[0]);
    final List<String> spectatorNames = new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length);
    for (final User spectator : spectatorsCopy) {
      spectatorNames.add(spectator.getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.SPECTATORS, spectatorNames);
```

This resolution balances clarity, modernity, and efficiency while respecting the semantic goals of both sides of the merge. If there is a specific reason to prefer explicit sizing for the array (e.g., performance concerns in a critical section), the HEAD version could be retained for that part. However, without additional context, the branch's approach seems more idiomatic.
