I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. The conflict arises from a difference in how the size of an `ArrayList` is initialized. Let's look at the intent and semantics of both sides:

- **HEAD (CustomCardFormatHelper.java)**: Uses `textParts.size()` to initialize the `ArrayList` capacity. This is likely from a context where `textParts` is treated as a collection with a `size()` method, which is common in Java for `JSONArray`.
- **Other branch (CardcastFormatHelper.java)**: Uses `textParts.length()` to initialize the `ArrayList` capacity. This might suggest that `textParts` is being treated as an array or a different type of object with a `length()` method, or it could be an error since `JSONArray` typically uses `size()`.

**Analysis of Intent**:
- Both sides aim to initialize an `ArrayList` with a capacity equal to the number of elements in `textParts` for efficiency.
- Since `textParts` is defined as a `JSONArray` in the surrounding context (not part of the conflict), the correct method to determine the number of elements in a `JSONArray` is `size()`, not `length()`. `length()` is not a valid method for `JSONArray` and would result in a compilation error.

**Resolution**:
The intent is clear: to initialize the `ArrayList` with the correct capacity based on the number of elements in `textParts`. Given that `textParts` is a `JSONArray`, the correct approach is to use `size()`. Therefore, I will resolve the conflict in favor of `textParts.size()` from the HEAD branch.

Here is the snippet with the conflict resolved:

```java
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml11(text);
  }

  public static String formatWhiteCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // The white cards should only ever have one element in text, but let's be safe.
    final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.size());
    for (final Object o : textParts) {
      final String cardCastString = (String) o;
      if (cardCastString.isEmpty()) {
        // skip blank segments
        continue;
```
