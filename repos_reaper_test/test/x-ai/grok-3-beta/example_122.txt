I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. The conflict is related to the superclass of `ContentEditorActivity`. Let's consider the intent and semantics of both sides:

- **HEAD**: Uses `BackActivity` as the superclass, which likely provides functionality for handling back navigation or related behavior specific to the activity's context in the current branch.
- **f8f91f1d**: Uses `RepositoryThemeActivity` as the superclass, which might be intended to apply a specific theme or provide repository-related functionality to the activity in the merged branch.

Since the intent behind choosing one superclass over the other is ambiguous without further context about the app's architecture or the purpose of these superclasses, I will leave the conflict unresolved and return the snippet as is.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
import rx.Subscriber;
import rx.android.schedulers.AndroidSchedulers;
import rx.functions.Func1;
import rx.schedulers.Schedulers;

<<<<<<< HEAD
public class ContentEditorActivity extends BackActivity
=======
public class ContentEditorActivity extends RepositoryThemeActivity
>>>>>>> f8f91f1d455f6842ca57b8294f6a263ff0cde1e4
    implements Toolbar.OnMenuItemClickListener, QueryTokenReceiver, ContentEditorPresenter.Callback {

  public static final String CONTENT = "CONTENT";
  private static final String HINT = "HINT";
  private static final String PREFILL = "PREFILL";
