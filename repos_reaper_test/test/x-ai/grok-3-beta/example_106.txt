I'll analyze the merge conflict to understand the intent of both sides.

The conflict appears in the import section of the Java file. On the `HEAD` side, there is an import statement for `org.junit.*`, which is likely intended to include necessary JUnit testing annotations and assertions for the test class. On the other side (commit `06e8633...`), there is no additional import, suggesting either a purposeful omission or that this import was not yet added in that branch.

Given that this is a test class (as indicated by the comment about testing `AbstractAssert#as(Description)`), the intent of including JUnit imports seems clear and necessary for the test to function. The `HEAD` side's import should be retained to ensure the test framework dependencies are available.

Since there is no conflicting import or code on the other side of the merge, I will resolve the conflict by keeping the `HEAD` import statement. Below is the snippet with the conflict resolved, while preserving all the original context and spacing.

```java
import org.fest.assertions.api.AbstractAssert;
import org.fest.assertions.api.ConcreteAssert;
import org.fest.assertions.description.Description;
import org.fest.test.ExpectedException;
import org.junit.*;
