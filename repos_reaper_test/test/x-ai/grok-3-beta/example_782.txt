Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, along with my analysis of the intent and semantics behind the conflict. I will also provide a resolution based on the inferred intent.

### Code Snippet with Conflict (Unmodified)

```java
  /**
   * Package-private interface to mark RPCs that are changing data in HBase.
   * @since 1.4
   */
  interface IsEdit {
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    /** RPC method name to use with HBase 0.95+.  */
    static final byte[] MUTATE = { 'M', 'u', 't', 'a', 't', 'e' };
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
  }

  /*
   * This class, although it's part of the public API, is mostly here to make
   * it easier for this library to manipulate the HBase RPC protocol.
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **HEAD Side**: The `HEAD` side of the conflict shows an empty interface `IsEdit` with no additional fields or methods. The intent here appears to be maintaining the interface as a simple marker interface without any specific implementation details or constants.
- **Incoming Change (d543609...)**: The incoming change introduces a `static final byte[] MUTATE` field, which defines an RPC method name for use with HBase 0.95+. The intent seems to be extending the interface to include a specific constant related to RPC method naming for mutating operations in HBase, likely to standardize or facilitate compatibility with different HBase versions.

### Interpretation

The conflict arises because the incoming change adds functionality (a constant related to RPC method naming) to the `IsEdit` interface, while the `HEAD` side keeps the interface minimal. Since `IsEdit` is described as a marker interface for RPCs that change data in HBase, adding a constant like `MUTATE` aligns with the purpose of providing metadata or configuration for such operations. There is no explicit contradiction or overlap in intent; the incoming change appears to be an enhancement rather than a replacement of existing functionality.

### Resolution

Given that the `HEAD` side does not introduce any conflicting content and the incoming change adds a useful constant that aligns with the stated purpose of the interface, I recommend accepting the incoming change. The resolved code would look like this:

```java
  /**
   * Package-private interface to mark RPCs that are changing data in HBase.
   * @since 1.4
   */
  interface IsEdit {
    /** RPC method name to use with HBase 0.95+.  */
    static final byte[] MUTATE = { 'M', 'u', 't', 'a', 't', 'e' };
  }

  /*
   * This class, although it's part of the public API, is mostly here to make
   * it easier for this library to manipulate the HBase RPC protocol.
```

### Conclusion

The resolution incorporates the incoming change as it provides additional context and utility to the `IsEdit` interface without conflicting with the existing purpose or structure. If there is additional context or constraints not visible in the snippet (e.g., a decision elsewhere to keep the interface empty for specific reasons), this resolution might need reconsideration. However, based on the provided information, this merge appears straightforward.
