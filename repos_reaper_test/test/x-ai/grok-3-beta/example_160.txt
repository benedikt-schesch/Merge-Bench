Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved in its original form with all context and spacing intact. I will then analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict and propose a resolution if possible.

```java
    public static JobContext sJobContext = null;

    public static class Combine
            extends Reducer<PigNullableWritable, NullableTuple, PigNullableWritable, Writable> {

<<<<<<< HEAD
        private final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());
=======
        private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Combine.class);

        //HADOOP-3226 Combiners can be called multiple times in both map and reduce
        private static boolean firstTime = true;
>>>>>>> f52ad1d45dda2f7312098d8b51fa287f11cc1944

        private byte keyType;

        //The reduce plan
        private PhysicalPlan cp;
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **Left Side (HEAD)**: The `log` variable is declared as `private final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());`. The intent here seems to be creating an instance-specific logger for the `Combine` class, tied to the runtime class of the object. The `final` keyword indicates that the logger reference won't change after initialization, which is common for loggers to prevent reassignment. Using `getClass()` provides flexibility if the class is subclassed, as it will log with the specific subclass name.

- **Right Side (f52ad1d45dda2f7312098d8b51fa287f11cc1944)**: The `log` variable is declared as `private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Combine.class);`, explicitly tying the logger to the `Combine` class. Additionally, a `static boolean firstTime = true;` variable is introduced, accompanied by a comment referencing "HADOOP-3226 Combiners can be called multiple times in both map and reduce." The intent here is to track whether the combiner is being called for the first time, likely to handle initialization or special behavior for multiple invocations of the combiner in a Hadoop job.

### Proposed Resolution

Both sides have distinct intents:
- **Logger declaration**: The difference between `getClass()` and `Combine.class` for the logger is subtle but important. Using `Combine.class` (right side) explicitly ties the logger to the `Combine` class, which is often the intended behavior in a static context or when subclassing isn’t a concern. Using `getClass()` (left side) is more flexible for inheritance but may not be necessary if `Combine` is not expected to be subclassed.
- **Additional variable and comment**: The right side introduces the `firstTime` flag to address a specific Hadoop issue (HADOOP-3226), which is a significant functional addition not present in the left side. This indicates a specific intent to handle multiple combiner invocations, which should be preserved.

Given that the `firstTime` variable is a clear functional enhancement and the logger declaration difference is more stylistic, I propose resolving the conflict by combining both intents. I will adopt the right side’s `static` logger with `Combine.class` for consistency (as it is explicit and matches the likely intent in a Hadoop context) and include the `firstTime` variable with its comment. However, I will also ensure the logger remains `private final` as both sides agree on this access level.

### Resolved Code Snippet

```java
    public static JobContext sJobContext = null;

    public static class Combine
            extends Reducer<PigNullableWritable, NullableTuple, PigNullableWritable, Writable> {

        private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Combine.class);

        //HADOOP-3226 Combiners can be called multiple times in both map and reduce
        private static boolean firstTime = true;

        private byte keyType;

        //The reduce plan
        private PhysicalPlan cp;
```

### Conclusion

The resolved code maintains the explicit logger declaration from the right side, ensuring clarity in logging behavior, and incorporates the `firstTime` variable to handle the specific Hadoop issue noted in the comment. If there is a specific reason to prefer `getClass()` over `Combine.class` for the logger (e.g., subclassing concerns), this resolution can be revisited. However, based on the provided context and typical Hadoop usage, this resolution aligns with the apparent intents of both sides.
