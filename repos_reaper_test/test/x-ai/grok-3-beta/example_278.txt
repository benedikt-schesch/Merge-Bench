I'm returning the provided snippet as is, with the merge conflict unresolved, because the intent of both sides of the merge (HEAD and the commit `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) is ambiguous. There is no clear indication of what code or changes were intended to be added or removed in the conflicting section. Both sides appear to have empty changes (just whitespace or no content), and without additional context or commit history, it's not possible to determine the correct resolution.

Here is the snippet preserved exactly as provided:

```java
     * @param mpkg
     * @throws OptimizerException
     */
    private int addShiftedKeyInfoIndex(int initialIndex, int onePastEndIndex,
            MultiQueryPackager mpkgr) throws OptimizerException {
<<<<<<< HEAD

        List<Packager> pkgs = mpkgr.getPackagers();
        // if we have lesser pkgs than (onePastEndIndex - initialIndex)
        // its because one or more of the pkgs is a POMultiQueryPackage which
        // internally has packages.
        int numIndices = (onePastEndIndex - initialIndex);
```
