I'll analyze the merge conflict to understand the intent from both sides. The conflict appears to be about a comment or lack thereof in the code. I'll preserve the entire snippet with the original context and spacing as provided, and since the intent isn't entirely clear or critical to functionality (as it's just a comment), I will return the snippet with the conflict unchanged.

```java
        return ErrorCode.NOT_JUDGE;
      } else if (state != GameState.JUDGING) {
        return ErrorCode.NOT_YOUR_TURN;
      }

      cardPlayer = playedCards.getPlayerForId(cardId);
