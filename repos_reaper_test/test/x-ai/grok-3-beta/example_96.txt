I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict unresolved since the intent of the changes on both sides is not entirely clear from the provided context alone. The `HEAD` side does not show any specific changes or additions in the conflicted area, while the other side (`ed08e371`) introduces imports related to dependency injection (`com.google.inject.Inject` and `com.google.inject.Provider`) and a reference to a module (`CahModule.*`). Without additional context about whether dependency injection is intended to be introduced or if itâ€™s part of a larger refactoring, I cannot confidently resolve the conflict.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved, maintaining the original formatting and spacing:

```java
