I'll analyze the intent of both sides of the merge conflict.

- **HEAD**: The HEAD side does not include the `import org.junit.Before;` statement, suggesting that there may not be a need for setup methods annotated with `@Before` in the current implementation, or it was intentionally omitted.
- **1e8c07a4ea963bc19dccd51b5d39ee814bd37f0b**: This side adds the `import org.junit.Before;`, indicating an intent to use the `@Before` annotation for setting up test conditions before each test method runs.

**Resolution Reasoning**: Since the conflict is about adding an import statement and not about actual logic or conflicting code, the safest and most inclusive approach is to include the `import org.junit.Before;` statement. Importing a package does not affect the code if it's unused, but omitting it could cause compilation errors if a `@Before` method is indeed present or needed in the codebase. The intent of the branch `1e8c07a4ea963bc19dccd51b5d39ee814bd37f0b` seems to be ensuring that the necessary tools for test setup are available.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved as provided, including the import from the branch:

import org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.Security218;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.containsString;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;
