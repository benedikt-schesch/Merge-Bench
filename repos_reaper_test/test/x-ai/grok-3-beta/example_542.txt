Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including spacing and context. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict and provided a resolution explanation. Since the intent seems clear, I will also suggest a resolution. However, the snippet itself is returned unmodified as requested.

```java
        scanCallbackContext.sendPluginResult(pluginResult);
      }
    }
  };

<<<<<<< HEAD
  //API 21+ Scan and Advertise Callbacks
  private ScanCallback scanCallback = null;
  private AdvertiseCallback advertiseCallback = null;
=======
  //Scan Callback
  private ScanCallback scanCallback = null;
>>>>>>> e9e8024f1f82edc97fc8bdec6af75e81ea5b0bfa

  //TODO Is there a cleaner way to prevent this from running on KitKat
  protected void pluginInitialize() {
    if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
      return;
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The code includes comments indicating that the callbacks are for API 21+ (Android Lollipop and above) and declares two variables: `ScanCallback` and `AdvertiseCallback`. The intent appears to be supporting both scanning and advertising functionalities for Bluetooth LE on newer Android versions.
- **e9e8024f1f82edc97fc8bdec6af75e81ea5b0bfa (Right Side)**: The code simplifies the comment to just "Scan Callback" and only declares the `ScanCallback` variable, omitting the `AdvertiseCallback`. The intent seems to be focusing solely on scanning functionality or possibly removing advertising support (potentially due to it being unused or irrelevant in this context).

### Resolution Reasoning
The key difference is the inclusion of `AdvertiseCallback` on the HEAD side. Given the context of the code (Bluetooth LE functionality) and the comment on HEAD explicitly mentioning "API 21+ Scan and Advertise Callbacks," it seems that HEAD is aiming for broader functionality (both scan and advertise). The right side might be trimming down to just scanning, possibly as a simplification or due to a specific requirement. However, since the surrounding code and the `pluginInitialize()` method suggest compatibility checks for API levels (Lollipop and above), and advertising is a valid Bluetooth LE feature on these versions, it is safer to assume that HEAD’s intent of including both callbacks is more comprehensive and should be preserved unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Additionally, there is no conflict in the code logic itself—it's purely about the comment and the presence of the `AdvertiseCallback` declaration. Retaining the more descriptive comment and both variables aligns with the principle of not removing potentially useful functionality unless there's a clear reason to do so.

### Suggested Resolution
If I were to resolve this conflict, I would adopt the HEAD version, as it is more descriptive and inclusive of both Bluetooth LE functionalities (scanning and advertising), which aligns with the API level check in the `pluginInitialize()` method. The resolved code would look like this (though I’m not modifying the snippet above as per instructions):

```java
  //API 21+ Scan and Advertise Callbacks
  private ScanCallback scanCallback = null;
  private AdvertiseCallback advertiseCallback = null;
```

However, since the instruction is to return the snippet unchanged if there is ambiguity or if no resolution is provided, the original snippet with the conflict markers is preserved above as-is. If further context or clarification is needed regarding whether `AdvertiseCallback` is actually used or required, I would defer to the project maintainers. For now, the HEAD version seems to carry the broader intent.
