Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, in markdown code syntax. I have not modified the context or spacing. After the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the conflict and a suggested resolution based on intent and semantics.

```java
    private String code = null;
    private int options = 1;
    private String mhtmlRoot = "";
    private String outputFilename = "";
    private int maxUriLength = DEFAULT_MAX_URI_LENGTH;  //IE8 only allows dataURIs up to 32KB
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private int maxImageSize;

```

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict

**Context and Intent:**
- The surrounding code appears to be a set of instance variable declarations in a Java class, likely related to handling URIs, images, or HTML content, given the variable names like `maxUriLength`, `mhtmlRoot`, and `outputFilename`.
- The conflict involves a single line in the `HEAD` branch where a variable `private int maxImageSize;` is declared. In the other branch (commit `790b69a0`), there is no such declaration; the code moves directly to the commented section for constructors.

**Semantic Intent:**
- The `HEAD` branch seems to introduce a new variable `maxImageSize` to possibly control or limit the size of images in the context of the application (e.g., for data URIs or rendering purposes, given the comment about IE8 data URI limits).
- The other branch (`790b69a0`) does not have this variable, which could mean it predates the addition of `maxImageSize` or intentionally omits it (e.g., if the feature was removed or deemed unnecessary).

**Potential Ambiguity:**
- It is unclear whether the omission in the `790b69a0` branch is deliberate (e.g., removing an unused or deprecated variable) or simply because the branch did not yet include this addition.
- There is no additional context or initialization for `maxImageSize` in the provided snippet, so it's uncertain if this variable is used elsewhere or if it's a placeholder for future development.

**Suggested Resolution:**
Since the `HEAD` branch introduces a new variable that aligns with the context of handling size limitations (similar to `maxUriLength`), and there is no explicit indication that the other branch intended to remove or reject such a feature, I suggest retaining the declaration from `HEAD`. This seems to be the more likely intent, as adding a variable indicates a purposeful extension of functionality.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, incorporating `maxImageSize`:

```java
    private String code = null;
    private int options = 1;
    private String mhtmlRoot = "";
    private String outputFilename = "";
    private int maxUriLength = DEFAULT_MAX_URI_LENGTH;  //IE8 only allows dataURIs up to 32KB
    private int maxImageSize;
    
    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Constructors
    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------    
```

If there is additional context or evidence elsewhere in the codebase that `maxImageSize` should not be included (e.g., if it's unused or part of a reverted feature), this resolution should be revisited. For now, based on the provided snippet, retaining the addition aligns with the apparent intent of the `HEAD` branch.
