Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics behind the conflicting changes are clear and can be resolved. Below the snippet, I will explain the resolution and provide the resolved version.

### Explanation of Conflict and Resolution
The conflict arises from a difference in the logging library being used:
- On the `HEAD` side, the code imports `org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager` and `org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger`, which indicates the use of Log4j 2.x, a newer version of the logging framework.
- On the `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a` side, the code imports `org.apache.log4j.Logger`, which refers to Log4j 1.x, an older version of the framework.

**Intent and Semantics**: 
- Both sides aim to include a logging mechanism in the codebase, but they differ in the version of the library. Log4j 2.x (used in `HEAD`) offers improved performance, features, and security compared to Log4j 1.x. It is likely that the `HEAD` branch represents an intentional upgrade to the newer version, while the other branch may reflect an older or unchanged part of the codebase.
- Given that Log4j 2.x is the more modern and secure choice, and assuming the project intends to upgrade (as evidenced by `HEAD`), the resolved version should adopt the `HEAD` imports unless there are specific compatibility issues (which are not evident in this snippet).

**Resolved Code Snippet**:
```java
import net.socialgamer.cah.RequestWrapper;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.ConnectedUsers;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.QueuedMessage;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.QueuedMessage.MessageType;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.User;

import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpSession;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;
```

**Note**: If the project explicitly requires Log4j 1.x for compatibility reasons (e.g., with other dependencies or legacy code), this resolution should be revisited. However, based solely on the snippet and common best practices, adopting Log4j 2.x from `HEAD` is the most semantically appropriate choice. Please confirm the project's logging framework requirements before finalizing this resolution in a real-world scenario.
