I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. The conflict appears in the error message of a `ProjectConfigurationException`. Let's look at the intent and semantics of both sides:

- **HEAD**: The error message is `"ClasspathEntry [" + path + "] not found in container [" + id + "]"`. This seems to be the correct and intended error message, clearly indicating that a classpath entry was not found in a specific container.
- **4b0f0ad0ce6afc98a1fc78b9fe46584c41f478e8**: The error message is `"ClasspathEntry [" + path + "] nt found in container [" + id + "]"`. This contains a typo ("nt" instead of "not"), which is likely a mistake and not intentional.

**Resolution**: The intent of both sides is to throw an exception when a classpath entry is not found in a container. The difference is a typo in the branch version. Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the HEAD version with the proper spelling.

Here is the full snippet with the resolved conflict (keeping the HEAD version), maintaining the original context, spacing, and markdown formatting exactly as provided:

```java
        for (IClasspathEntry entry : container.getClasspathEntries()) {
            if (entry.getPath().toOSString().contains(path)) {
                return entry;
            }
        }
        throw new ProjectConfigurationException("ClasspathEntry [" + path + "] not found in container [" + id + "]");
    }

    protected void assertErrorMarker(IProject project, String type) throws CoreException {
        List<IMarker> markers = findMarkers(project, IMarker.SEVERITY_ERROR);
        for (IMarker marker : markers) {
