I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict unresolved since the intent and semantics of both sides of the conflict are ambiguous without additional context about the data type and structure expected from the `Tuple` object.

```java
        pigServer.registerQuery("c1 = order c by value;");

        // order in lexicographic, so 12 comes before 2
        Iterator<Tuple> iter = pigServer.openIterator("b1");
        assertTrue("b1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
<<<<<<< HEAD
        assertEquals("first item in b1", iter.next().getAtomField(0).longVal(), 12);
        assertTrue("b1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
        assertEquals("second item in b1", iter.next().getAtomField(0).longVal(), 2);
=======
        assertEquals("first item in b1", iter.next().get(0), "12");
        assertTrue("b1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
        assertEquals("second item in b1", iter.next().get(0), "2");
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        assertFalse("b1 is over", iter.hasNext());

        iter = pigServer.openIterator("c1");
        assertTrue("c1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

**Explanation of Ambiguity:**
- **HEAD side**: This side uses `getAtomField(0).longVal()` to retrieve the value as a `long` integer, suggesting that the data is expected to be numeric and is being compared as numbers (12 and 2).
- **Other side (1488b22)**: This side uses `get(0)` and compares the values as strings ("12" and "2"), implying that the data is treated as text, which aligns with the comment about lexicographic ordering where "12" comes before "2".
- **Conflict Reasoning**: The intent is unclear because the comment mentions lexicographic ordering (which supports the string comparison), but the HEAD side treats values as numbers. Without knowing the data type of the `Tuple` elements or the expected behavior of the Pig query output, it's not possible to determine which approach is correct. Additionally, the API used (`getAtomField` vs `get`) differs, which might indicate a change in the underlying library or data structure, further complicating the resolution without more context.
