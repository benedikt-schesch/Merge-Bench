I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent behind the changes needs clarification. The conflict involves a difference in the texture loading mechanism (`mBitmapTexture` vs. `mBitmapTextureAtlas`), and without additional context or documentation about the purpose of each, it's ambiguous which should be used or if a combined approach is needed.

Here is the original snippet preserved in markdown code syntax with the conflict markers intact:

```java
			this.mMusic.setLooping(true);
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}

<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTexture);
=======
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```
