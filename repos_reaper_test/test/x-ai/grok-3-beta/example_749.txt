I'll provide the snippet as it is since the intent of both sides of the merge conflict is ambiguous without further context about the purpose of the code or the changes being made. The `HEAD` side introduces specific imports related to concurrent locks and MOA (Massive Online Analysis) components, while the other side (commit `87ea390`) removes those imports or does not include them, potentially aligning with a different implementation or version of the codebase. Without clarity on whether these imports are necessary or redundant, I will preserve the conflict as is.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the merge conflict:
