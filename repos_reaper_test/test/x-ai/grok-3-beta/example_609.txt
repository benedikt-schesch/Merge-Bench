Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including spacing and context. After the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the conflict and a proposed resolution based on the semantic intent.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageStartInfo extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String type;

```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Context and Intent Analysis:**
- **HEAD (Left Side):** Contains a field `serialVersionUID` which is typically used for serialization purposes in Java classes that implement `Serializable`. The intent here seems to be ensuring proper versioning for serialization compatibility, a common practice in classes that might be serialized/deserialized.
- **Other Side (Right Side, commit `a17acec...`):** This side is empty in the conflict area, implying that the `serialVersionUID` field might have been removed or was never present in this branch. The rest of the code after the conflict marker (below the conflict) introduces fields like `type` with annotations (`@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@Facebook`), which are likely related to a framework (e.g., Lombok for getter/setter generation and a custom annotation for Facebook integration). The intent here seems to focus on defining the structure and behavior of the `PageStartInfo` class without a `serialVersionUID`.
- **Surrounding Context:** The class `PageStartInfo` extends `AbstractFacebookType`, indicating it might be part of a larger library or framework interacting with Facebook APIs. The doc comment indicates a version `1.10.0`, suggesting this is part of a versioned release.

**Semantic Intent:**
- The presence of `serialVersionUID` in the HEAD suggests that the class is intended to be serializable, and the field is included for compatibility.
- The absence of `serialVersionUID` in the other branch might indicate either an intentional removal (perhaps if serialization is no longer needed) or an oversight (if it was never added). Since the rest of the code includes fields with framework-specific annotations, the focus seems to be on functionality rather than serialization specifics.
- Since `AbstractFacebookType` (the parent class) is not shown in the snippet, I cannot confirm if it implements `Serializable`. However, given that `serialVersionUID` is often added prophylactically or as a requirement in such hierarchies, and removing it could break compatibility if the class or its parent is serializable, the safer assumption is to retain it.

**Proposed Resolution:**
I will resolve the conflict by retaining the `serialVersionUID` from the HEAD to ensure serialization compatibility, assuming that the class or its parent might implement `Serializable`. The rest of the code (fields like `type` with annotations) remains unaffected as it is outside the conflict markers and appears consistent across both sides.

**Resolved Code:**
```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageStartInfo extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String type;
```

**Note:** If serialization is explicitly not intended for this class (e.g., if `AbstractFacebookType` does not implement `Serializable`), the `serialVersionUID` could be omitted. However, without full context on the class hierarchy or project guidelines, retaining it is the safer and more semantically conservative choice to avoid potential runtime issues. If this assumption is incorrect, the resolution can be revisited with additional context.
