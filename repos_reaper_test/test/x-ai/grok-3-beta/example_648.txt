Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics are clear and can be resolved by combining the descriptions for broader clarity. I will first present the unchanged snippet with the conflict, followed by my reasoning, and then provide the resolved version.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Unchanged)
```java
  @Setter
  @Facebook("comments")
  private Comments comments;

  /**
<<<<<<< HEAD
   * Attachment (image) added to a comment.
=======
   * Attachment (image, link, album, video) added to a comment.
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
   *
   * To force Facebook to fill the <code>attachment</code> field you have to fetch the comment with the
   * <code>fields=attachment</code> parameter, otherwise the attachments are <code>null</code>.
   *
   * @return Attachment on the comment
```

### Reasoning
- **Left Side (HEAD)**: Describes the attachment as specifically an "image" added to a comment. This is more limited in scope.
- **Right Side (a17acec...)**: Expands the description of attachment to include "image, link, album, video," which is more comprehensive and likely reflects an updated or broader understanding of the types of attachments supported.
- **Intent**: Both sides are documenting the purpose of an attachment field for a comment in a Facebook-related context. The right side appears to be an enhancement or correction to include more attachment types, making the documentation more accurate and useful.
- **Resolution**: Adopt the broader description from the right side to ensure the documentation is complete and reflects all possible attachment types. There is no loss of information since "image" is still included in the list.

### Resolved Snippet
```java
  @Setter
  @Facebook("comments")
  private Comments comments;

  /**
   * Attachment (image, link, album, video) added to a comment.
   *
   * To force Facebook to fill the <code>attachment</code> field you have to fetch the comment with the
   * <code>fields=attachment</code> parameter, otherwise the attachments are <code>null</code>.
   *
   * @return Attachment on the comment
