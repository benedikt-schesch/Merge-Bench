I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. My goal is to understand the intent behind both sides of the merge and resolve it semantically if possible. Below, I will return the snippet as is, preserving the original context and spacing, and then provide my analysis and resolution (if applicable).

```java
import org.spout.nbt.StringTag;
import org.spout.nbt.stream.NBTInputStream;
import org.spout.nbt.stream.NBTOutputStream;
import org.spout.nbt.util.NBTMapper;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.spout.engine.SpoutServer;
import org.spout.engine.world.SpoutServerWorld;
=======
>>>>>>> 67bcb76a96f358fc131320b0611ffaa3bf3678c2

public class WorldFiles {

	public static final byte WORLD_VERSION = 2;
	
```

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict

- **Left Side (HEAD)**: This side includes two additional import statements:
  - `import org.spout.engine.SpoutServer;`
  - `import org.spout.engine.world.SpoutServerWorld;`
  These imports suggest that the code in this branch likely uses classes related to the server-side implementation of the Spout engine, specifically for handling server and world-related functionalities.

- **Right Side (67bcb76a...)**: This side has no additional imports, effectively removing or not including the two imports present in HEAD. This could indicate either that the imports are unnecessary in this branch (perhaps because the code no longer relies on these classes) or that they were intentionally removed or never added.

- **Intent and Semantics**: 
  - The intent behind HEAD seems to be ensuring that necessary server-related classes are available for use in the `WorldFiles` class, likely for functionality tied to server or world management.
  - The intent behind the right side is less clear. It could be an oversight (not adding the imports), a deliberate removal (indicating these classes are no longer needed), or a merge artifact where this branch simply didn't touch this part of the code.
  - Since the snippet provided does not include further context (e.g., the body of the `WorldFiles` class where these imports might be used), it's ambiguous whether the imports are required or not.

- **Resolution Decision**: Without additional context about whether `SpoutServer` and `SpoutServerWorld` are used in the `WorldFiles` class in either branch, I cannot definitively resolve the conflict. Retaining unnecessary imports is generally harmless (though not ideal for code cleanliness), while removing necessary imports will break the build. However, since the right side actively does not include the imports (possibly indicating they are not needed), and without evidence of their usage, I will err on the side of caution and retain the conflict as is for manual resolution by someone with more context.

### Conclusion
I am returning the snippet with the conflict unresolved due to ambiguous intent and lack of context about the usage of the imported classes. If further code or context is provided, I can reassess the intent and propose a resolution. For now, the snippet remains unchanged as shown above.
