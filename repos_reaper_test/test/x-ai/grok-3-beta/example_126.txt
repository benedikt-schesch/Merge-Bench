I'll analyze the merge conflict with the intent and semantics in mind.

The conflict is in how the commit message is accessed and displayed. Let's look at both sides:

- **HEAD**: Uses `commit.commit.message` to access the message, suggesting that the `commit` object has a nested `commit` field (possibly due to a specific API response structure or model design).
- **c120f1dfe1...**: Uses `commit.message` directly, implying that the `commit` object itself contains the `message` field without a nested `commit` object.

**Intent Analysis**:
- Both sides intend to display the commit message in the `commitMessageTextView` using `Html.fromHtml()` for formatting.
- The difference lies in the object structure, which could be due to a change in the data model or API response between the branches.
- Without further context on the `Commit` class structure, it's ambiguous whether `commit.commit.message` or `commit.message` is correct.

**Resolution**:
Since the correct object path depends on the actual structure of the `Commit` class (which is not provided in the snippet), I will not resolve the conflict and will return the snippet as is. If I had to make an educated guess, I would lean towards the simpler `commit.message` from the incoming branch as it might reflect an updated or refactored model, but I will adhere to the instruction to preserve the conflict when unsure.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java

  @Override
  public void onResponse(Commit commit, boolean firstTime) {

    if (commit.commit != null && commit.commit.message != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.commit.message));
=======
      commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.message));
>>>>>>> c120f1dfe1a968fce9fb82f405228d0fe13fe71c
    }

    User author = commit.author;

    if (author != null) {
