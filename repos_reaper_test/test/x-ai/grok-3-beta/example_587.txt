I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided Java code snippet and return it with the original context preserved. After reviewing the two sides of the conflict, I can see that both are defining a method signature for creating a `FacebookException`, but with different parameter lists. Let's look at the intent behind each change:

- **HEAD**: This version uses a single `ExceptionInformation` object as a parameter, likely a structured container for all relevant exception data. The intent seems to be encapsulating various pieces of information into one object for simplicity and maintainability.
- **Branch (a17acec)**: This version explicitly lists out individual parameters for different pieces of error information (error codes, message, type, etc.) along with a `JsonObject` for raw error data. The intent here appears to be providing fine-grained control and explicitness over the data used to construct the exception.

Since the intent and approach differ significantly (structured object vs. explicit parameters), and without additional context on the codebase's design decisions or which approach aligns with the current architecture, I will not attempt to resolve the conflict. Merging these without understanding the broader context (e.g., whether `ExceptionInformation` encapsulates the same fields as the explicit parameters) risks breaking the code or misaligning with project goals. Therefore, I am returning the snippet unchanged with the conflict markers intact.

```java
   * 
   * @param container
   *          container for all data needed to create the associated {@see FacebookException}
   * @return An appropriate {@code FacebookException} subclass.
