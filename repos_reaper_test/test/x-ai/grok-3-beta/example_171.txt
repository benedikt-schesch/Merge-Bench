Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as it was given, including spacing and context. I will then explain my analysis of the conflict and provide a resolution based on the semantic intent.

```java
        if (wrapper == null)
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "can't open DFS file while executing locally");
        
        return openDFSFile(fileName, ConfigurationUtil.toProperties(wrapper.getJobConf()));
<<<<<<< HEAD
        
=======

>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }

    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName, Properties properties) throws IOException{
        DataStorage dds = new HDataStorage(properties);
        ElementDescriptor elem = dds.asElement(fileName);
```

### Analysis of the Conflict
Looking at the merge conflict, I notice that there is no actual conflicting code content between the `HEAD` and the commit `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`. The conflict markers show empty sections on both sides of the `=======` separator. This suggests that the conflict might have been introduced due to whitespace changes, line endings, or a version control system glitch, rather than a semantic disagreement in the code.

- **HEAD side**: There is no additional code or changes shown after the `return` statement.
- **Commit 1488b22 side**: Similarly, there are no changes or additional code after the `return` statement.

Since both sides of the conflict are empty, it appears that there is no divergence in intent or functionality. The surrounding context indicates that the method is returning a call to `openDFSFile` with converted properties from `wrapper.getJobConf()`. The intent seems to be consistent across both branches.

### Resolution
Given the absence of conflicting code or changes on either side of the merge conflict markers, I conclude that this is likely a non-semantic conflict (possibly caused by whitespace or formatting differences). The resolution is to remove the conflict markers and retain the code as it appears in the context, without adding or modifying any content.

Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict markers removed:

```java
        if (wrapper == null)
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "can't open DFS file while executing locally");
        
        return openDFSFile(fileName, ConfigurationUtil.toProperties(wrapper.getJobConf()));
    }

    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName, Properties properties) throws IOException{
        DataStorage dds = new HDataStorage(properties);
        ElementDescriptor elem = dds.asElement(fileName);
```

### Explanation of Resolution
Since there is no apparent difference in intent or content between the two sides of the conflict (both are empty), the resolution simply involves cleaning up the conflict markers and preserving the surrounding code as is. This maintains the original functionality of returning the result of `openDFSFile` with the provided arguments. If there were hidden whitespace or line-ending issues, they are not visible in the provided snippet and do not affect the semantics of the code. If further context or hidden changes are discovered later, this resolution can be revisited.
