I'll analyze the merge conflict based on the intent and semantics of both sides. Here's the snippet with the conflict unchanged, followed by my reasoning. The code is preserved exactly as provided with the original spacing and context.

```java
   * @return The location of this event, a structured address object.
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  @Facebook
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private Location venue;
=======
  private Venue venue;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  /**
   * Number of people interested in the event.
   *
   * @since Graph API 2.1
```

**Analysis and Reasoning:**

- **HEAD (Left Side):** Uses `private Location venue;`
  - The intent appears to be using a type `Location` for the field `venue`, suggesting that `Location` is a class or type representing a structured address (as hinted by the Javadoc comment above).
- **Other Branch (Right Side):** Uses `private Venue venue;`
  - The intent here is to use a type `Venue` for the field `venue`, implying that `Venue` might be a different or updated representation of the event's location, possibly with additional or different properties compared to `Location`.
- **Contextual Clues:** 
  - The Javadoc mentions "a structured address object," which could align with either `Location` or `Venue` depending on the implementation details of these types.
  - The annotations (`@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@Facebook`) suggest this is likely part of a library or framework (e.g., interacting with the Facebook Graph API), where the field type might need to match a specific API response structure.
- **Intent Ambiguity:** Without knowing the full codebase or the definitions of `Location` and `Venue`, it's unclear which type is the correct or intended one for representing the event's location. `Location` might be a generic address type, while `Venue` could be more specific to events (common in social media APIs like Facebook). Alternatively, this could be a refactoring or naming update in one of the branches.

**Resolution Decision:** Since the exact intent and the correct type (`Location` or `Venue`) cannot be determined without additional context (e.g., class definitions, API documentation, or commit history), I am leaving the conflict unresolved as provided. If more context or clarification is available (e.g., which type maps to the Facebook Graph API's venue data), I can revisit the resolution. For now, the snippet is returned with the conflict markers intact to avoid introducing an incorrect assumption.
