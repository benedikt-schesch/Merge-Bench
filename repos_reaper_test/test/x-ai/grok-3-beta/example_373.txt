Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including all context and spacing. I will also provide an analysis of the intent and semantics behind both sides of the merge conflict and propose a resolution if possible.

```java
  public boolean supportsMethod(String method) {
    return Arrays.binarySearch(SUPPORTED_METHODS, method) >= 0;
  }

  @Override
<<<<<<< HEAD
  @Beta
=======
>>>>>>> 51762f221ec8ab38da03149c8012e63aec0433dc
  public boolean isMtls() {
    return this.isMtls;
  }

  @Override
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD ( `@Beta` )**: The `HEAD` side of the conflict includes the `@Beta` annotation on the `isMtls()` method. The intent here seems to be marking the method as part of a beta feature or API, likely indicating that it is not yet stable or fully supported and might be subject to change. This is often used in libraries or frameworks (e.g., Google libraries) to caution users about using certain features.
- **Other Branch (empty, commit `51762f221ec8ab38da03149c8012e63aec0433dc`)**: The other side of the conflict has no additional annotations or changes to the method declaration. The intent here appears to be maintaining the method as-is, without any special annotations or metadata like `@Beta`.

### Proposed Resolution
Since the conflict only involves the presence or absence of the `@Beta` annotation, and there are no other modifications to the method's functionality or signature on either side, the intent behind `HEAD` seems to be explicitly marking the method as beta for informational or cautionary purposes. The other branch does not add or modify anything, so it likely represents the original or unchanged state of the code.

Given that `@Beta` is typically a non-breaking addition (it doesn't affect the functionality of the code, only its metadata), I propose resolving the conflict by adopting the `HEAD` version, which includes the `@Beta` annotation. This preserves the intent to mark the method as beta while maintaining the core functionality of the method unchanged.

### Resolved Code Snippet (if accepted)
If you agree with the resolution, the resolved code would look like this:

```java
  public boolean supportsMethod(String method) {
    return Arrays.binarySearch(SUPPORTED_METHODS, method) >= 0;
  }

  @Override
  @Beta
  public boolean isMtls() {
    return this.isMtls;
  }

  @Override
```

### Caveat
If the `@Beta` annotation has specific implications in your codebase (e.g., it triggers certain behaviors, warnings, or restrictions), or if there is a policy against adding such annotations without broader consensus, the conflict should remain unresolved until further clarification from the team or stakeholders. In such a case, I would recommend returning the original snippet with the conflict markers as provided.

If you need further assistance or additional context to finalize the resolution, please let me know! For now, I am returning the original snippet with the conflict preserved as requested if the intent remains ambiguous.

```java
  public boolean supportsMethod(String method) {
    return Arrays.binarySearch(SUPPORTED_METHODS, method) >= 0;
  }

  @Override
<<<<<<< HEAD
  @Beta
=======
>>>>>>> 51762f221ec8ab38da03149c8012e63aec0433dc
  public boolean isMtls() {
    return this.isMtls;
  }

  @Override
```
