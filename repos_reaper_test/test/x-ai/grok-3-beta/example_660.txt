Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent behind the changes is not entirely clear without additional context. I will also provide an explanation of the potential semantics and intent behind both sides of the conflict.

```java
		buildService.setJdk(jdk);
		
		listener = new DummyAndroidBuildListener();

		registry.registerBuildListener(listener);
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
		projectConfigurationManager = MavenPlugin.getProjectConfigurationManager();
>>>>>>> b782a4bb6b4349d23790909d1e67891adbaa126c
    }

	@Override
	protected void tearDown() throws Exception {
		listener.clear();
```

**Analysis of Intent and Semantics:**

- **HEAD (Left Side):** The `HEAD` side does not introduce any new code in the conflicting section. This suggests that the intent on this branch was to maintain the existing behavior without adding new functionality or modifications at this point in the code. It might indicate that this branch did not require or intend to interact with a `projectConfigurationManager`.

- **b782a4bb6b4349d23790909d1e67891adbaa126c (Right Side):** This side introduces the initialization of a `projectConfigurationManager` by retrieving it from `MavenPlugin.getProjectConfigurationManager()`. The intent here appears to be setting up or accessing Maven-related project configuration management, possibly as part of integrating or updating Maven functionality in the build or test setup process.

**Potential Resolution Considerations:**
Without additional context about the purpose of `projectConfigurationManager` or whether it is necessary for the current test or build setup, it is unclear whether this line should be included. If the `projectConfigurationManager` is essential for Maven integration or another feature introduced in the branch corresponding to commit `b782a4bb6b4349d23790909d1e67891adbaa126c`, it should likely be retained. If it is unrelated to the current context or introduces unnecessary dependencies, it might be omitted.

Since the intent is ambiguous and I do not have access to the broader codebase or the purpose of each branch, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers unchanged. If more context or clarification is provided (e.g., the role of `projectConfigurationManager` or the goals of each branch), I can propose a specific resolution.
