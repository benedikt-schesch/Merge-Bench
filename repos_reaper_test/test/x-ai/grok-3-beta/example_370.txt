I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and provide the entire snippet with the conflict unresolved since the intent is ambiguous without additional context.

```java
 * @author rmistry@google.com (Ravi Mistry)
 */
public final class GoogleUtils {

  /** Current release version. */
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public static final String VERSION = "1.30.5".toString();
  // {x-version-update-end:google-api-client:current}
=======
  public static final String VERSION = getVersion();
>>>>>>> a6c6decbd4a162ff4030e2c3f74c72eb6ac9eddb

  // NOTE: Integer instead of int so compiler thinks it isn't a constant, so it won't inline it
  /**
   * Major part of the current release version.
   *
```

**Analysis of Intent and Semantics:**
- **HEAD (Left Side)**: This version hardcodes the version number as `"1.30.5"` with a `toString()` call and includes a comment indicating some kind of version update marker (`// {x-version-update-end:google-api-client:current}`), suggesting this might be part of an automated version update process.
- **Other Branch (Right Side)**: This version replaces the hardcoded value with a method call `getVersion()`, implying a dynamic or computed version retrieval, possibly to make the version number more maintainable or configurable at runtime.

**Reason for Keeping Conflict Unresolved:**
The intent behind these changes is ambiguous without additional context. Specifically:
- It's unclear whether the hardcoded version number in HEAD is the intended final value or just a temporary placeholder.
- It's unclear what `getVersion()` does (e.g., where it's defined, whether it returns a constant or dynamically computed value, and whether it aligns with the version update mechanism suggested by the comment in HEAD).
- There's no information about the broader design decision—whether the library should have a hardcoded version (for simplicity or specific release needs) or a dynamic one (for flexibility or automation).

Without knowing the project’s versioning strategy, the role of the `getVersion()` method, or the significance of the update marker comment, resolving this conflict risks misinterpreting the intended semantics. Therefore, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact as provided.
