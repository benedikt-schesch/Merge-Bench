I'll return the snippet with the conflict as is, since the intent behind the merge conflict is ambiguous. The conflict involves the presence or absence of a Javadoc reference to `hashCode()` which does not seem directly related to the method `getData()` below. Without further context on why the reference to `hashCode()` is included or removed, or whether it is a documentation error, I cannot confidently resolve the conflict.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
  private List<Comment> data = new ArrayList<Comment>();

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  /**
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
   * @see java.lang.Object#hashCode()
   */
  /**
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
   * The comments.
   *
   * @return The comments.
   */
  public List<Comment> getData() {
```
