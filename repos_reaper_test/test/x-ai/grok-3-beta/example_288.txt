Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and spacing, formatted in markdown code syntax. I have not modified the content or resolved the conflict because the intent of the changes on the `HEAD` side is clear, but the `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a` side is empty, which might indicate an intentional deletion or an incomplete merge. Without further context or documentation on why the lines were removed on the other branch, I will leave the conflict unresolved for now. Below is my reasoning followed by the unchanged snippet.

### Reasoning:
- **HEAD Side**: The code initializes a `readOnce` boolean array with a size of `numInputs` and sets all elements to `false`. The intent appears to be tracking whether inputs have been read or processed, likely for some logic related to input handling in the application.
- **Other Side (88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a)**: There are no changes or code provided on this side of the conflict, which might suggest an intentional removal of the `readOnce` initialization or an incomplete merge. Without additional context or commit messages, it's unclear whether this deletion was meant to remove the functionality or if it was an oversight.
- **Semantic Intent**: The `HEAD` side introduces new functionality or state tracking with `readOnce`, while the other side might be avoiding this addition. Since I cannot determine the intent of the deletion or absence of code on the other side, I will not attempt a resolution.
- **Conclusion**: I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers unchanged to avoid making assumptions about the intent of the empty side of the merge conflict. If further context or clarification is provided, I can assist in resolving it.
