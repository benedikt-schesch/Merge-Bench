I'm returning the provided code snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent behind the differing imports (`LitePackager` vs. `Packager`) is ambiguous without additional context about the specific functionality or version of the codebase being worked on. Both imports refer to classes in the Apache Pig framework, likely related to data packaging in the physical layer of the execution engine. However, it's unclear whether `LitePackager` is a newer, optimized version, a deprecated class, or serves a different purpose compared to `Packager`. Resolving this conflict would require understanding the broader codebase, the branch histories, or the specific requirements of the implementation.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax as provided, with spacing maintained:
