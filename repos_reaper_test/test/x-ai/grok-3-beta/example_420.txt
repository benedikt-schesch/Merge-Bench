I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict resolved based on the semantic intent of both sides. The context will be preserved exactly as provided.

```java
import org.apache.maven.plugins.annotations.Mojo;
import org.apache.maven.plugins.annotations.Parameter;
import org.apache.maven.plugins.annotations.ResolutionScope;
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;
import org.jbake.app.Oven;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.ConfigUtil;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.DefaultJBakeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfigurationFactory;

import java.io.File;

/**
 * Runs jbake on a folder
```

**Explanation of Resolution**:  
Both sides of the merge conflict are importing classes related to JBake configuration. The `HEAD` version includes `JBakeConfigurationFactory`, while the other branch (`1b4df424bf08d98e85eab0c3f6e7e29a5832b07c`) includes `ConfigUtil`. The intent on both sides appears to be ensuring the necessary configuration classes are available for the JBake plugin. Since these imports are not mutually exclusive and serve complementary purposes (`JBakeConfigurationFactory` for creating configuration and `ConfigUtil` likely for utility functions), I have combined both imports to preserve the functionality intended by both branches. The rest of the context remains unchanged.
