Below is the provided code snippet with the surrounding context, preserved exactly as given, including spacing and formatting, followed by an analysis of the merge conflict and a proposed resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

### Code Snippet with Context (Unmodified)
```java
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected){
=======
  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    bytes.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Analysis of Merge Conflict
The conflict arises in the method signature of `isNotEqualTo` in the `ByteAssert` class. Let's break down the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (Current Branch):** The method signature is written as `public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected){` (note the missing space between `expected` and the opening brace `{`).
- **Incoming Branch (61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7):** The method signature is written as `public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {` (note the space between `expected` and the opening brace `{`).

**Semantic Intent:**
- Both sides are clearly defining the same method with the same functionality (asserting that a byte value is not equal to an expected value).
- The difference is purely stylistic and relates to code formatting (presence or absence of a space before the opening brace).
- There is no functional or semantic difference between the two versions; the conflict is only about coding style.

**Resolution Approach:**
- Since the difference is stylistic, the resolution can adopt either format based on project coding standards or consistency with surrounding code.
- However, adding a space between the parameter list and the opening brace (`) {`) is a common Java coding convention (e.g., as per Google Java Style Guide or common IDE defaults), and it appears in the incoming branch. Therefore, I will lean toward the incoming branch's formatting for better readability and consistency with widely accepted practices.

### Resolved Code Snippet
```java
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Explanation of Resolution
I resolved the conflict by adopting the formatting from the incoming branch (`61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7`), which includes a space before the opening brace. This choice aligns with common Java coding conventions for readability. The rest of the method body remains unchanged as it was identical on both sides of the conflict. The conflict markers have been removed, and the code is now consistent in the resolved version. If the project has a specific style guide that mandates no space before the brace, the `HEAD` version could be chosen instead; however, without such context, I prioritized readability and convention.
