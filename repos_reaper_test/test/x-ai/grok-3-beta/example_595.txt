I'll analyze the merge conflict and then provide the snippet as requested. Let's look at the intent and semantics:

- **HEAD**: Uses `FacebookType` as the parent class for `Location`.
- **a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe**: Uses `AbstractFacebookType` as the parent class for `Location`.

**Analysis**: The conflict revolves around the parent class of `Location`. `FacebookType` might be an older or more general base class, while `AbstractFacebookType` could be a newer or more specific abstraction introduced in the codebase. Typically, moving to a more specific or updated base class (like `AbstractFacebookType`) is the intended evolution in a library or framework, especially if it's coming from a later commit or branch. Without more context about the class hierarchy or project conventions, I'll assume that `AbstractFacebookType` is the intended parent class, as it appears to be a deliberate change in the incoming branch.

However, since the instruction emphasizes returning the snippet unchanged if the intent is ambiguous or if I'm unsure, and to preserve the original formatting, I will return the snippet as provided without modification.
