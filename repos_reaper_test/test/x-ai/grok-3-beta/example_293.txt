I'll resolve the merge conflict by analyzing the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge. Let's first preserve the original snippet with the conflict as provided:

```java
    public boolean mustGenerateObjectId(Object pojo) {
        for (BeanPropertyDefinition def : beanDescription(pojo.getClass()).findProperties()) {
            if (idSelector.isId(def)) {
                AnnotatedMember accessor = def.getAccessor();
                accessor.fixAccess(true);
<<<<<<< HEAD
                return idSelector.isObjectId(def) && accessor.getValue(pojo) == null;
=======
                return isObjectId(def) && accessor.getValue(pojo) == null;
>>>>>>> c417ada53c003bd4dbb38959f4581fa161b47d43
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

### Analysis of the Conflict:
- **HEAD side (`idSelector.isObjectId(def)`)**: This side uses `idSelector.isObjectId(def)` to determine if the property is an Object ID. The intent seems to rely on an `idSelector` object to perform the check, which suggests a more modular or configurable approach to identifying Object IDs.
- **Incoming side (`isObjectId(def)`)**: This side uses a direct method call `isObjectId(def)`, which might be a simplification or refactoring to avoid dependency on `idSelector`. The intent appears to streamline the logic by directly invoking a method (possibly a local or utility method).
- **Shared Intent**: Both sides aim to check if the property is an Object ID and return `true` only if the value of the property (accessed via `accessor.getValue(pojo)`) is `null`. The difference lies in how the Object ID check is performed.

### Resolution Rationale:
Without additional context about whether `idSelector.isObjectId(def)` and `isObjectId(def)` are equivalent or if one is a refactoring of the other, it is safer to preserve the original intent of using `idSelector` (from HEAD), as it appears to be a more explicit dependency or configuration-based approach, which might be critical to the logic. However, since I cannot be certain of the broader codebase or whether `isObjectId(def)` is a valid replacement, I will leave the conflict unresolved and return the original snippet as is.

If further context or clarification is provided (e.g., whether `isObjectId(def)` is a direct replacement or if `idSelector` is required), I can revisit the resolution.

Thus, the snippet with the conflict remains unchanged as shown above.
