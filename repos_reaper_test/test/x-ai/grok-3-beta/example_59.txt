I'm returning the code snippet with the resolved merge conflict. My analysis is based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge. The conflict is purely stylistic and does not affect the functionality of the code. Both sides are trying to achieve the same thing: initializing a `HashMap` to store data for a `ReturnableData` key and `Object` value. The difference lies in whether to explicitly declare the generic types (`<ReturnableData, Object>`) or to use the diamond operator (`<>`). Since modern Java (post-Java 7) encourages the use of the diamond operator for type inference, I will resolve the conflict in favor of the `5adedd248` branch's approach.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved exactly as provided:

```java

      synchronized (roundPlayers) {
        for (final Player player : roundPlayers) {
          final List<WhiteCard> cards = playedCards.getCards(player);
          if (cards == null || cards.size() < blackCard.getPick()) {
            final Map<ReturnableData, Object> data = new HashMap<>();
            data.put(LongPollResponse.EVENT, LongPollEvent.HURRY_UP.toString());
            data.put(LongPollResponse.GAME_ID, this.id);
            final QueuedMessage q = new QueuedMessage(MessageType.GAME_EVENT, data);
            player.getUser().enqueueMessage(q);
          }
```
