I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict unchanged since the intent of both sides of the merge is not clear from the provided context. The conflict markers show that one side (HEAD) has no changes or content in this section, while the other side (commit 5e4c2091) also appears to have no content or changes between the conflict markers. Without additional context or code differences, it's ambiguous how to resolve this conflict.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict markers preserved:

```java
		}
	}

	@Override
	public PlaylistRemote[] getUserPlaylist(String user) throws JSONException, WSError {
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

>>>>>>> 5e4c2091dc2827219ba601937e8686bcb90bae78
		try {
			user = URLEncoder.encode(user, "UTF-8" );
			String jsonString = doGet("id+name+url+duration/playlist/json/playlist_user/?order=starred_desc&user_idstr="+user);
			return PlaylistFunctions.getPlaylists(new JSONArray(jsonString));
		} catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {

```
