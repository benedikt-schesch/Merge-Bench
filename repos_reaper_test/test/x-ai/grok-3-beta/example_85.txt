**Explanation of Conflict and Resolution Approach:**

After analyzing the merge conflict, I have decided not to resolve it due to ambiguous intent and differing semantics between the two sides of the merge. Here is my reasoning:

- **HEAD (CustomDeck.java)**: This version uses `CustomBlackCard` and `CustomWhiteCard` as the types for the `blackCards` and `whiteCards` sets. The intent seems to be focused on a custom implementation of cards specific to a `CustomDeck` class, likely for user-defined or custom card sets in the application.

- **Other Branch (CardcastDeck.java)**: This version uses `CardcastBlackCard` and `CardcastWhiteCard` as the types for the same sets. The intent here appears to be integrating with a specific card source or provider called "Cardcast," which likely has its own card type implementations tailored to its API or data structure.

- **Conflict Analysis**: The conflict arises because the two branches are using different class names/types for the card sets, reflecting potentially different purposes or domains (custom decks vs. Cardcast-specific decks). Additionally, the file paths and class names (`CustomDeck` vs. `CardcastDeck`) suggest that these might be intended as separate classes or implementations rather than a direct merge of the same class. Merging them without additional context about whether this should be a single unified class (with polymorphism or generics to handle different card types) or two separate classes would risk breaking the intended functionality on either side.

- **Resolution Decision**: Due to the ambiguity in intent—whether the goal is to unify the implementations, create a generic card type, or maintain separate classes—I have chosen to leave the conflict unresolved. Resolving this would require more context about the overall architecture (e.g., whether `CardcastDeck` should extend or relate to `CustomDeck`, or if a common interface or base class for card types should be introduced). Without this information, any resolution could misalign with the developers' goals.

Therefore, the snippet is returned as is, with the conflict markers intact for further review by the development team.
