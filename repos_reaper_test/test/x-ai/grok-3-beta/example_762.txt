Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics behind the changes are not entirely clear without additional context about the purpose of `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER` or the broader codebase. I will also provide an analysis of the potential intent and why I am leaving the conflict unresolved.

```java
>>>>>>> 2d0abace41a98eccdcd180deee15181c7238898d
   */
  public DeleteRequest(final byte[] table,
                       final byte[] key,
                       final byte[] family) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    this(table, key, family, null, RowLock.NO_LOCK);
=======
    this(table, key, family, DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER, RowLock.NO_LOCK);
>>>>>>> 2d0abace41a98eccdcd180deee15181c7238898d
  }

  /**
   * Constructor to delete a specific cell.
   * <strong>These byte arrays will NOT be copied.</strong>
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD (Left Side):** The constructor call passes `null` as the fourth argument, suggesting that no specific marker or additional data is required for the deletion operation in this context. This could imply a simpler or more generic deletion behavior.
- **Incoming Change (Right Side, commit `2d0abace41`):** The constructor call passes `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER` as the fourth argument, which likely introduces a specific marker or flag to indicate a particular type of deletion (perhaps scoped to a family or with specific semantics). Without knowing what `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER` represents or its purpose in the codebase, it's unclear whether this is a critical behavior change or an optional enhancement.
- **Shared Intent:** Both sides aim to initialize a `DeleteRequest` for a specific table, key, and family, with a default `RowLock.NO_LOCK`. The difference lies in the fourth parameter, which might pertain to how the deletion is processed or flagged.

### Reason for Not Resolving
The intent behind `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER` is ambiguous without additional context about its role in the system. Resolving this conflict could risk introducing incorrect behavior:
- If `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER` is essential for certain deletion operations, using `null` (from HEAD) might break functionality.
- If `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER` is a new feature or optimization not yet needed in the HEAD branch, adopting it prematurely could introduce unnecessary complexity or bugs.

To resolve this conflict, I would need more information about:
1. The purpose and semantics of `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER`.
2. Whether the HEAD branch intentionally avoids using a marker for simplicity or compatibility.
3. The broader context of how `DeleteRequest` is used in the application.

Until such information is available, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact to avoid making an incorrect assumption. If you can provide additional context or clarification about the intent of these changes, Iâ€™d be happy to propose a resolution.
