I'll provide the code snippet as-is with the merge conflict, since understanding the intent requires additional context. My analysis is that one side of the merge likely intends to enforce a security check for script execution permissions (as seen in the `Jenkins.get().checkPermission(Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS);` line), while the other side might be omitting this check intentionally for a reason not clear in this snippet. Without further context on the purpose of `doSubmit` or the security policies intended for this method, I cannot confidently resolve the conflict.

Here is the unchanged code snippet:

```java
        return filePathRules.checkFileAccess(op, f);
    }

    @RequirePOST
    public HttpResponse doSubmit(StaplerRequest req) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD

        Jenkins.get().checkPermission(Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS);

        String whitelist = Util.fixNull(req.getParameter("whitelist"));
        if (!whitelist.endsWith("\n"))
            whitelist+="\n";

        Enumeration e = req.getParameterNames();
```
