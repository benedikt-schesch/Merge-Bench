I'm returning the provided snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent of the changes on both sides of the merge is ambiguous based on the given context. The `HEAD` side introduces additional imports (`java.net.URI` and `java.util.Map`) and a static import (`org.structr.rest.common.HttpHelper.getAsStream`), which suggests potential additions or modifications to the code that rely on these imports. However, the other side of the merge (commit `1fc925c0741b0f6d64564077e1ac747e1c0b6407`) appears to remove or omit these changes, but without further context or code below the conflict markers, the purpose of this omission isn't clear. Resolving this conflict requires understanding whether these imports are necessary for the functionality being implemented or if they were intentionally removed.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax:

```java
import org.structr.core.property.Property;
import org.structr.core.property.StringProperty;
import org.structr.rest.common.HttpHelper;

import java.io.InputStream;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.net.URI;
import java.util.Map;

import static org.structr.rest.common.HttpHelper.getAsStream;
