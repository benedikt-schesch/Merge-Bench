Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including spacing and context. I will also explain my analysis of the intent and semantics behind both sides of the merge conflict and provide a resolution if possible.

```java
        // for backward compatibility
        PigInputFormat.sJob = conf;

        InputFormat inputFormat = loadFunc.getInputFormat();

<<<<<<< HEAD
        List<Long> inpLimitLists =
=======
        List<Long> inpLimitLists = 
>>>>>>> 1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81
                (ArrayList<Long>)ObjectSerializer.deserialize(
                        conf.get("pig.inpLimits"));

        return new PigRecordReader(inputFormat, pigSplit, loadFunc, context, inpLimitLists.get(pigSplit.getInputIndex()));
    }
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics:
- **HEAD side (`List<Long> inpLimitLists =`)**: This side has no additional space after the equals sign. The intent appears to be purely stylistic or a result of code formatting preferences or tools (e.g., IDE auto-formatting) that enforce a specific spacing rule.
- **Other side (`List<Long> inpLimitLists = `)**: This side includes an extra space after the equals sign before the line break. Again, this seems purely stylistic, likely due to a different formatting convention or manual editing.

### Semantic Merge Resolution Reasoning:
- The conflict is purely cosmetic and does not affect the functionality or intent of the code. Both sides declare a `List<Long>` variable named `inpLimitLists` and deserialize a configuration value into it. The difference is only in the spacing after the equals sign.
- Since there is no functional difference, the resolution can follow either style. However, for consistency and readability (and aligning with common Java coding conventions, such as those in the Google Java Style Guide), I will recommend removing the extra space after the equals sign, as it is more concise and widely accepted in auto-formatting tools.

### Resolved Code Snippet (if applicable):
Since the conflict is purely stylistic, I will provide a resolved version below while preserving the original snippet above as requested.

```java
        // for backward compatibility
        PigInputFormat.sJob = conf;

        InputFormat inputFormat = loadFunc.getInputFormat();

        List<Long> inpLimitLists =
                (ArrayList<Long>)ObjectSerializer.deserialize(
                        conf.get("pig.inpLimits"));

        return new PigRecordReader(inputFormat, pigSplit, loadFunc, context, inpLimitLists.get(pigSplit.getInputIndex()));
    }
```

### Conclusion:
The conflict was resolved by choosing the `HEAD` side's formatting (no extra space after the equals sign) for consistency and alignment with common Java style guides. If a specific project style guide dictates otherwise (e.g., requiring a space), the resolution can be adjusted accordingly. Since the intent and semantics are identical on both sides, this resolution does not alter the code's behavior.
