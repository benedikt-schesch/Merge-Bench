I'll return the snippet with the resolved merge conflict. My analysis of the intent is as follows:

- Both sides of the merge are working on the same test method `testBigGroupAll`.
- The conflict is in the creation of a temporary file.
- The `HEAD` side uses a generic name `"test"` and a hardcoded extension `"txt"`.
- The other side (`1488b22`) uses a more specific prefix by calling `this.getName()` (likely to get the test name) and a proper extension `".txt"`.
- The intent of the second side seems to be making the temporary file name more unique and identifiable by associating it with the test name, which is a better practice for debugging and cleanup.

Given this, I'll resolve the conflict by adopting the more specific and meaningful file naming convention from the second side.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving all context and spacing as provided:

```java

    }

    @Test
    public void testBigGroupAll() throws Throwable {
        int LOOP_COUNT = 4*1024;
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile(this.getName(), ".txt");
        PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(tmpFile));
        for(int i = 0; i < LOOP_COUNT; i++) {
            ps.println(i);
        }
        ps.close();
