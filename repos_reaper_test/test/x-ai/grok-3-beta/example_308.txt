Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and spacing. Following that, I will explain my thought process regarding the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict and provide a resolution.

```java
														// if Google blocks this

	private static final String HEADER_APPLICATION_URL = "Application-URL";
	private static final String CHROME_CAST_MODEL_NAME = "Eureka Dongle";
	private static final String TRANSCODING_EXTENSIONS = "wmv,avi,mkv,mpg,mpeg,flv,3gp,ogm";
<<<<<<< HEAD
	private static final String TRANSCODING_PARAMETERS = "vcodec=VP80,vb=1000,vfilter=canvas{width=640,height=360},acodec=vorb,ab=128,channels=2,samplerate=44100,threads=2";

	private int port = EmbeddedServer.HTTP_PORT;
	private List<DialServer> servers = new ArrayList<DialServer>();
	private JComboBox deviceList;
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

The merge conflict revolves around the `TRANSCODING_PARAMETERS` string, which appears to define parameters for a transcoding process (likely for video or audio streaming/conversion). Let's analyze both sides:

- **HEAD (left side):** This version includes the parameter `threads=2` at the end of the string. This suggests an intent to specify the number of threads used for transcoding, potentially to optimize performance or limit resource usage.
- **a4124a4ad635d102c78fcfce196713a40477586f (right side):** This version omits the `threads=2` parameter. The intent here might be to simplify the configuration, use a default number of threads, or avoid hardcoding a specific thread count that may not be optimal across different environments or hardware.

**Common Intent:** Both sides agree on the video and audio encoding parameters (e.g., `vcodec=VP80`, `vb=1000`, `acodec=vorb`, etc.), which indicates that the core functionality of transcoding settings is consistent. The difference lies only in the inclusion of the `threads` parameter.

**Potential Reasoning:**
- Including `threads=2` (HEAD) might be useful for controlling resource usage, especially on devices with limited processing power, or for ensuring compatibility with specific hardware or software environments.
- Omitting `threads=2` (right side) might reflect a decision to let the transcoding library or system determine the optimal number of threads dynamically, avoiding potential performance bottlenecks or compatibility issues caused by a hardcoded value.

**Resolution Decision:** Without additional context about the transcoding library or the target environment, it is safer to preserve the more explicit configuration (HEAD) since it provides a specific instruction that might be critical for certain use cases. However, if the `threads` parameter is not supported by the underlying system or causes issues, it can be revisited. Given the lack of explicit documentation or comments explaining the change, I will lean towards including the additional parameter as it reflects a deliberate intent to control threading behavior.

### Resolved Code Snippet

Here is the resolved version of the code snippet with the merge conflict addressed:

```java
														// if Google blocks this

	private static final String HEADER_APPLICATION_URL = "Application-URL";
	private static final String CHROME_CAST_MODEL_NAME = "Eureka Dongle";
	private static final String TRANSCODING_EXTENSIONS = "wmv,avi,mkv,mpg,mpeg,flv,3gp,ogm";
	private static final String TRANSCODING_PARAMETERS = "vcodec=VP80,vb=1000,vfilter=canvas{width=640,height=360},acodec=vorb,ab=128,channels=2,samplerate=44100,threads=2";
	private static final String PROPERTY_TRANSCODING_EXTENSIONS = "transcoding.extensions";
	private static final String PROPERTY_TRANSCODING_PARAMETERS = "transcoding.parameters";
	private int port = EmbeddedServer.HTTP_PORT;
	private List<DialServer> servers = new ArrayList<DialServer>();
	private JComboBox deviceList;
```

### Final Note
If there is additional context or documentation indicating that the `threads` parameter should be omitted (e.g., due to dynamic thread management by the transcoding library), the resolution can be revisited to favor the right side of the merge. For now, the resolution prioritizes explicit configuration to avoid potential issues arising from unspecified behavior.
