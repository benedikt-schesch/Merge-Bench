I'm returning the provided code snippet with the merge conflict resolved. After analyzing both sides of the conflict, Iâ€™ve determined that the intent on both sides is semantically identical. The difference in spacing (a space before the comma on the HEAD side versus no space on the other side) does not affect the functionality or intent of the code. Both sides aim to split a string parameter by commas and convert it into a list using `Arrays.asList()`. Therefore, I will resolve the conflict by choosing the version from the `HEAD` side for consistency, but note that either version would work equally well.

Here is the full snippet with the conflict resolved, presented in markdown code syntax with the original spacing and context preserved:

```java
            } else if ("--application-name".equals(arg)) {
                applicationName = getParameter(args, ++i);
            } else if ("--endpoint".equals(arg)) {
                endpoint = getParameter(args, ++i);
            } else if ("--jaxrs-resources".equals(arg)) {
                jaxRsResources = Arrays.asList(getParameter(args, ++i).split(
                        ","));
            } else {
                defSource = arg;
            }
        }
```
