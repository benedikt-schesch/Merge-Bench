Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict to propose a resolution. Following the snippet, I will explain my reasoning and provide the resolved code if appropriate.

```java
                            @Override
                            public void onFinished(Void result) {
                                UiThread.getInstance().post(new Runnable() {
                                    @Override
                                    public void run() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
                                        Logger.log(SmsSentReceiver.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed message deleted ");

                                        App.bus.post(new ReloadMessagesEvent());
                                    }
                                });
                            }
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **Left Side (HEAD)**: The intent here appears to be logging a message indicating that a failed message has been deleted. The line `Logger.log(SmsSentReceiver.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed message deleted ");` suggests a focus on debugging or tracking the deletion of a failed SMS message.
- **Right Side (2d52502932f7e7875f4269e8198e522945bcf696)**: The intent on this side is to trigger a UI update or refresh of the messaging interface by posting a `ReloadMessagesEvent` to the application bus (`App.bus.post(new ReloadMessagesEvent());`). This suggests a focus on updating the app state or UI after some operation (possibly the same deletion of a failed message).
- **Conflict Context**: The conflict arises because the right side has removed the logging statement, while the left side retains it but does not include the event posting. Both actions occur within the `run()` method of a `Runnable` posted to the UI thread, indicating they are likely related to the same operation (handling the result of deleting a failed SMS message).

### Resolution Reasoning
Both intents are complementary and not mutually exclusive:
- Logging the deletion of a failed message is useful for debugging or monitoring purposes.
- Posting a `ReloadMessagesEvent` is necessary for updating the UI or app state to reflect the deletion.

Since there is no indication that these actions conflict semantically (e.g., one does not undo or interfere with the other), the most logical resolution is to combine both actions. This preserves the debugging utility from the left side and the functional update from the right side.

### Resolved Code Snippet
Below is the resolved version of the code snippet, incorporating both the logging statement and the event posting:

```java
                            @Override
                            public void onFinished(Void result) {
                                UiThread.getInstance().post(new Runnable() {
                                    @Override
                                    public void run() {
                                        Logger.log(SmsSentReceiver.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed message deleted ");
                                        App.bus.post(new ReloadMessagesEvent());
                                    }
                                });
                            }
```

### Final Note
If there is any specific reason (not apparent from the provided context) that these actions should not be combined—such as a policy against logging in certain environments or a different mechanism for UI updates—please clarify the intent or provide additional context. In the absence of such information, combining both actions aligns with the apparent intent of both sides of the merge.
