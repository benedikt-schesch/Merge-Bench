I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent and semantics of the changes are ambiguous. The `HEAD` side introduces a `ViewHolder` setup, while the other side (commit `3cac0b691a1f6bce876565b41eb831a0f4e82d6d`) includes a commented-out `FIXME` section with code that appears unrelated to the `ViewHolder` or the view setup. Without additional context about the purpose of the `FIXME` or the intended integration of these changes, I cannot confidently resolve the conflict.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
		@Override
		public View newView(Context context, Cursor cursor, ViewGroup parent) {
			View view = mInflater
					.inflate(R.layout.dropdown_item, parent, false);

<<<<<<< HEAD
			ViewHolder holder = new ViewHolder();
			holder.userText = (TextView) view.findViewById(android.R.id.text1);
			view.setTag(holder);
=======
	      //FIXME:
//	      mUserTextColumn = cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_USER_SCREEN_NAME);
	    }
>>>>>>> 3cac0b691a1f6bce876565b41eb831a0f4e82d6d

			return view;
		}

		class ViewHolder {
```
