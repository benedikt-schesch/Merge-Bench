Let's analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. I'll return the snippet unchanged since the intent behind the changes is ambiguous without further context, and I'll explain my reasoning.

Here is the code snippet as provided:

```java

package org.apache.pig.impl.io;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.io.BufferedInputStream;
=======
import java.io.BufferedReader;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
```

**Reasoning for not resolving the conflict:**

- **Context and Intent Analysis**: The conflict involves a difference in the imported class between `BufferedInputStream` (from the `HEAD` branch) and `BufferedReader` (from the commit with hash `1488b22`). These two classes serve different purposes in Java I/O operations:
  - `BufferedInputStream` is typically used for reading binary data or raw bytes with buffering to improve performance.
  - `BufferedReader` is used for reading text from a character-input stream, often with better support for text processing (like reading lines).
- **Ambiguity in Intent**: Without additional context about how these imports are used in the codebase (e.g., whether the code is processing binary data or text data), it is unclear which import is correct or if both might be needed. The rest of the code (not shown in the snippet) would likely indicate which class is being utilized or if both are relevant.
- **Risk of Incorrect Resolution**: Choosing one over the other without understanding the downstream code could introduce bugs or break functionality. For instance, replacing `BufferedInputStream` with `BufferedReader` (or vice versa) could lead to incorrect data handling if the code expects binary versus text input.

**Recommendation**: I suggest leaving the conflict markers in place and consulting with the developers of the respective branches or reviewing the surrounding code to understand the intended usage of the import. If both classes are needed, both imports can be included. If only one is required, the correct one should be chosen based on the context of the I/O operations in the code.

Since the intent is ambiguous, I have returned the snippet unchanged as requested.
