I'll return the snippet as provided in markdown code syntax without modifying the context or spacing. After that, I'll explain my rationale for the merge conflict resolution (or lack thereof) based on the intent and semantics.

```java
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
import java.util.Properties;

import junit.framework.TestCase;

<<<<<<< HEAD

import org.junit.Test;

>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;
import org.apache.pig.EvalFunc;
import org.apache.pig.FuncSpec;
import org.apache.pig.LoadFunc;
```

### Explanation of Intent and Semantics
- **Context Analysis**: The code appears to be part of a Java file, likely related to Apache Pig (given the Pig-specific imports like `EvalFunc`, `FuncSpec`, and `LoadFunc`). The conflict is around the testing framework imports.
- **HEAD Side**: This side does not include any additional imports in the conflict area (it effectively omits `org.junit.Test`).
- **Other Side (commit 1488b22)**: This side introduces an additional import for `org.junit.Test`, suggesting a shift or addition to using JUnit 4 or later for testing (as `org.junit.Test` is part of JUnit 4+).
- **Existing Context**: The code already imports `junit.framework.TestCase`, which is part of JUnit 3.x, indicating that the codebase may currently rely on an older JUnit version.
- **Intent Ambiguity**: It is unclear whether the intent is to fully migrate to JUnit 4+ (and thus remove `junit.framework.TestCase`) or to support a mixed environment with both JUnit 3 and 4. Additionally, there is no further context provided in the snippet about how these imports are used in the codebase, making it ambiguous whether both imports are needed or if one should be discarded.
- **Semantic Risk**: Resolving this conflict without additional context (e.g., the rest of the file or project structure) risks breaking the build or tests if the wrong testing framework is chosen or if dependencies are not aligned.

### Resolution Decision
Due to the ambiguity in intent and the potential risk of breaking the code without further context, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact. A proper resolution would require understanding whether the project is migrating to JUnit 4+ or if both frameworks are intentionally used together. If resolution is needed, I recommend the following steps:
1. Check the rest of the file or related test files to see which JUnit version is predominantly used.
2. If migrating to JUnit 4+, remove `junit.framework.TestCase` and keep `org.junit.Test`.
3. If supporting both, keep both imports (though this is less common and may indicate a transitional state).

If you can provide more context or clarify the intent, I can offer a specific resolution. For now, the snippet remains as is with the conflict markers.
