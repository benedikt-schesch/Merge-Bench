I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. The conflict revolves around the name of a contributor in the Javadoc author tag. Let's look at the intent and semantics of both sides:

- **HEAD (Current Branch):** Lists the author as "Olivier Michallat".
- **Incoming Change (Branch being merged):** Lists the author as "Olivier Demeijer".

The intent on both sides is to credit a contributor named Olivier for their work on the code. The conflict likely arises from a typo, a name change, or a misunderstanding about the correct spelling of the contributor's last name. Without additional context about which name is correct, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The resolution would depend on verifying the correct spelling of the contributor's name, possibly by consulting project records or the contributor themselves.

Since the intent is ambiguous without further information, I will return the snippet with the conflict unchanged, preserving the original spacing and context as provided.
