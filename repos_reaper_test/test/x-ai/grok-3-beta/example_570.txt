Let me analyze this merge conflict by considering the intent and semantics of both sides.

**Analysis of the Conflict:**

- **HEAD (Left Side):** Imports all classes from the `com.restfb.json` package using a wildcard (`import com.restfb.json.*;`). This suggests an intent to include all JSON-related utilities and classes from the `restfb` library without specifying individual classes. It also imports `com.restfb.types.Comments`, indicating the use of a `Comments` type from a general `types` package.
- **Other Branch (Right Side):** Specifically imports individual classes like `JsonArray`, `JsonException`, and `JsonObject` from the `com.restfb.json` package. This suggests a more explicit approach, possibly to avoid unnecessary imports or for clarity/documentation purposes. It also imports `com.restfb.types.Post.Comments`, which seems to be a more specific or updated reference to the `Comments` type within a `Post` subclass or inner class.
- **Intent:** Both sides are likely trying to ensure the necessary JSON parsing utilities and the `Comments` type are available in the codebase. The difference lies in the granularity of the imports (wildcard vs. specific) and the exact path to the `Comments` type.

**Resolution Strategy:**

I will resolve this conflict by combining the intents of both sides while prioritizing specificity and avoiding redundancy. I'll use explicit imports for clarity (as in the right side) and ensure the correct `Comments` type is imported. Since `com.restfb.types.Post.Comments` (from the right side) appears to be a more specific or updated reference, I will prefer it over the more general `com.restfb.types.Comments` unless there’s a clear reason not to. However, since I’m not entirely sure of the project structure or whether these are indeed the same class, I will preserve both imports to avoid breaking any dependencies.

Here is the snippet with the resolved conflict:

```java
import static java.lang.String.format;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableSet;

import com.restfb.exception.FacebookJsonMappingException;
import com.restfb.json.JsonArray;
import com.restfb.json.JsonException;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
import com.restfb.types.Comments;
import com.restfb.types.Post.Comments;
import com.restfb.util.DateUtils;
import com.restfb.util.ReflectionUtils.*;

import java.lang.reflect.Constructor;
import java.lang.reflect.Field;
```

**Rationale for Resolution:**

- I replaced the wildcard `import com.restfb.json.*;` with specific imports (`JsonArray`, `JsonException`, `JsonObject`) to maintain clarity and avoid unnecessary imports, aligning with the intent of the right side (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`).
- I kept both `com.restfb.types.Comments` and `com.restfb.types.Post.Comments` to ensure compatibility, as it is unclear whether they refer to the same class or if one is a more specific type. This avoids potential compilation errors while preserving the intent of both branches.
- The rest of the context remains unchanged as requested.

If there’s additional context or clarification about whether `Comments` and `Post.Comments` are the same or if a specific one should be preferred, I can adjust the resolution accordingly. For now, this merged version should cater to the semantic goals of both sides.
