Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax as requested. I have kept the context and spacing exactly as provided. Below the snippet, I will explain my analysis of the conflict and propose a resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

```java
        FrameLayout v = new FrameLayout(getContext());
        viewCollection.add(v);
        addView(v);
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    public void setStackMargin(int margin){
        mStackMargin = margin;
        mCardAnimator.setStackMargin(mStackMargin);
=======
    public void setStackMargin(int margin) {
        mMargin = margin;
        mCardAnimator.setStackMargin(mMargin);
>>>>>>> 4f63cd1aed839ff53f4afb6076a74f113d583e40
        mCardAnimator.initLayout();
    }

    public int getStackMargin() {
        return mMargin;
```

### Analysis and Proposed Resolution

Let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict:

- **HEAD (Left Side)**:
  - Uses the variable name `mStackMargin` to store the margin value.
  - The method signature lacks a space between `margin` and the closing parenthesis (`int margin)`), which may just be a formatting difference.
  - The intent appears to be setting a margin value specifically tied to the concept of a "stack margin" (as indicated by the variable name `mStackMargin`).

- **Commit 4f63cd1aed839ff53f4afb6076a74f113d583e40 (Right Side)**:
  - Uses the variable name `mMargin` to store the margin value.
  - Has a space between `margin` and the closing parenthesis (`int margin )`), which is a minor formatting difference.
  - The intent appears to be setting a margin value, but the variable name `mMargin` is more generic, not explicitly tied to "stack margin."

- **Common Intent**:
  - Both sides are updating a margin value and passing it to `mCardAnimator.setStackMargin()`.
  - The difference lies in the variable name used to store the margin (`mStackMargin` vs. `mMargin`).
  - The getter method `getStackMargin()` in the context below the conflict returns `mMargin`, which aligns with the right side's variable name.

- **Conflict Issue**:
  - The primary issue is the discrepancy in variable names (`mStackMargin` vs. `mMargin`).
  - Since the getter method `getStackMargin()` returns `mMargin`, using `mStackMargin` in the setter (as in HEAD) would create an inconsistency in the codebase. This suggests that `mMargin` is likely the intended variable name for consistency across the class.

- **Proposed Resolution**:
  - I recommend adopting the variable name `mMargin` (from the right side) to maintain consistency with the getter method `getStackMargin()` returning `mMargin`.
  - The formatting difference (space before parenthesis) is minor and can follow the right side's style for consistency.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
        FrameLayout v = new FrameLayout(getContext());
        viewCollection.add(v);
        addView(v);
    }

    public void setStackMargin(int margin) {
        mMargin = margin;
        mCardAnimator.setStackMargin(mMargin);
        mCardAnimator.initLayout();
    }

    public int getStackMargin() {
        return mMargin;
```

### Rationale for Resolution
- **Consistency**: The getter method returns `mMargin`, so using `mMargin` in the setter ensures consistency in variable naming across the class.
- **Intent Preservation**: Both sides aim to set a margin value and update the `mCardAnimator` with that value. The resolved code preserves this intent.
- **Formatting**: The resolved code adopts the formatting style of the right side (space before parenthesis) as it is a minor difference and aligns with common Java conventions in many codebases.

If there is additional context or a specific style guide that dictates using `mStackMargin` or a different naming convention, this resolution can be revisited. However, based on the provided snippet, this resolution aligns with the apparent intent and maintains consistency within the visible code.
