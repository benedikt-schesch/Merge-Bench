Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict as provided, preserved in markdown code syntax with unchanged context and spacing. Below the snippet, I will explain my analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict.

```java
    data.put(LongPollResponse.EVENT, LongPollEvent.GAME_ROUND_COMPLETE.toString());
    data.put(LongPollResponse.ROUND_WINNER, cardPlayer.getUser().getNickname());
    data.put(LongPollResponse.WINNING_CARD, clientCardId);
    data.put(LongPollResponse.INTERMISSION, ROUND_INTERMISSION);
    if (showRoundLinkProvider.get()) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      data.put(LongPollResponse.ROUND_PERMALINK,
          String.format(roundPermalinkFormatProvider.get(), roundId));
=======
      data.put(LongPollResponse.ROUND_PERMALINK, String.format(roundPermalinkFormatProvider.get(), roundId));
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
    }
    broadcastToPlayers(MessageType.GAME_EVENT, data);

    notifyPlayerInfoChange(getJudge());
    notifyPlayerInfoChange(cardPlayer);
```

### Analysis of Merge Conflict
Upon reviewing the conflicting lines, I note that both sides of the merge (HEAD and the incoming branch `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a`) have nearly identical code. The only difference appears to be in the formatting or spacing of the lines:

- **HEAD version**: The code is split across two lines with `data.put(...)` on the first line and the `String.format(...)` on the second line, with a specific indentation.
- **Incoming branch version**: The code appears to be formatted differently, potentially removing the line break or adjusting spacing (though in the provided snippet, it looks visually similar due to markdown rendering).

**Intent and Semantics**: The semantic intent of both sides is identical. Both are attempting to add a round permalink to the `data` map using `String.format` with a provided format string and `roundId`. The difference is purely stylistic, likely due to code formatting tools or manual edits. There is no functional difference between the two versions.

**Resolution**: Since the intent is the same, I can confidently resolve the conflict by choosing either version. I will select the HEAD version to maintain consistency with the current branch's formatting style, as it preserves the line break and indentation as shown in the context.

### Resolved Code
Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict markers removed, maintaining the HEAD formatting:

```java
    data.put(LongPollResponse.EVENT, LongPollEvent.GAME_ROUND_COMPLETE.toString());
    data.put(LongPollResponse.ROUND_WINNER, cardPlayer.getUser().getNickname());
    data.put(LongPollResponse.WINNING_CARD, clientCardId);
    data.put(LongPollResponse.INTERMISSION, ROUND_INTERMISSION);
    if (showRoundLinkProvider.get()) {
      data.put(LongPollResponse.ROUND_PERMALINK,
          String.format(roundPermalinkFormatProvider.get(), roundId));
    }
    broadcastToPlayers(MessageType.GAME_EVENT, data);

    notifyPlayerInfoChange(getJudge());
    notifyPlayerInfoChange(cardPlayer);
```

If there is any additional context or concern about the formatting difference that wasn't visible in the provided snippet (e.g., trailing spaces or tabs vs. spaces), please let me know, and I can revisit the resolution. However, based on the current information, the conflict is resolved with the HEAD version due to identical intent.
