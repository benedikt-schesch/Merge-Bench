Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge but found the intent ambiguous without additional context about the purpose of the `getNames` import from `JsonObject`. Therefore, I am returning the snippet unchanged.

```java
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
 * THE SOFTWARE.

package com.restfb.types;

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromLongFormat;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;

import com.restfb.Facebook;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper;
```

### Reasoning:
- **Left Side (HEAD):** The `HEAD` version does not include the `import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames;` statement, suggesting that this import might not be necessary or was removed intentionally in this branch.
- **Right Side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe):** This side adds the `import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames;`, implying that there might be code elsewhere in this branch that relies on this static method for JSON object name retrieval or processing.
- **Ambiguity:** Without additional context about whether the `getNames` method is used in the codebase or what specific functionality it provides, it's unclear whether this import should be retained or omitted. Including it unnecessarily could be harmless but might indicate incomplete refactoring, while omitting it could break dependent code not visible in this snippet.
- **Conclusion:** Due to the ambiguity in intent and lack of broader context, I am preserving the conflict markers and returning the snippet as is. If further information about the usage of `JsonObject.getNames` or the purpose of the changes in either branch is available, I can revisit this resolution.
