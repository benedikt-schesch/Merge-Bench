I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and explain my reasoning before providing the resolved code (or leaving it unresolved if the intent is ambiguous).

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict
- **Context**: The code snippet is part of a help or usage string that lists various commands for interacting with a table (likely in a database or storage system). Commands like `get`, `put`, `delete`, `scan`, and others are listed with their syntax.
- **Conflict**: The conflict arises between the `HEAD` (no additional line) and the branch `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` (introduces a new command `mscan` with its syntax).
  - **HEAD**: Does not include the `mscan` command.
  - **Branch**: Adds a new command `mscan` with the syntax `mscan <table> [start] [family[:qualifier[,qualifier]]/[family...]] [stop] [regexp]`.
- **Intent**:
  - The branch likely intends to extend the functionality by introducing a new command (`mscan`), possibly for a more complex or multi-family scan operation, given the syntax allowing multiple qualifiers or families.
  - The `HEAD` does not have this command, so it might be an older version or a different branch without this feature.
- **Semantic Resolution**: Since the branch adds a new feature (the `mscan` command) without conflicting with existing commands or syntax, the intent seems clearâ€”to include the additional command. There is no overlap or contradiction with other commands, so merging the new line from the branch appears to be the correct resolution.

### Resolved Code
Since the intent is clear and there is no ambiguity in adding the new command, I will resolve the conflict by including the `mscan` command from the branch.

```java
                       + "  get <table> <key> [family] [qualifiers ...]\n"
                       + "  icv <table> <key> <family> <qualifier> [amount]\n"
                       + "  put <table> <key> <family> <qualifier> <value>\n"
                       + "  delete <table> <key> [<family> [<qualifier>]]\n"
                       + "  scan <table> [start] [family] [qualifier] [stop] [regexp]\n"
                       + "  mscan <table> [start] [family[:qualifier[,qualifier]]/[family...]] [stop] [regexp]\n"
                       + "  cas <table> <key> <family> <qualifier> <expected> <value>\n"
                       + "Variants that acquire an explicit row-lock:\n"
                       + "  lget <table> <key> [family] [qualifiers ...]\n"
                       + "  lput <table> <key> <family> <qualifier> <value>\n"
                       + "  ldelete <table> <key> <family> <qualifier>\n"
```

### Conclusion
The conflict is resolved by accepting the branch's addition of the `mscan` command, as it introduces new functionality without conflicting with the existing codebase. The spacing and context are preserved exactly as provided.
