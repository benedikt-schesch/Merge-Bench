Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including all spacing and context. After that, I will provide my analysis and resolution of the conflict based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

### Original Code Snippet with Conflict
```java
                        
                        if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength) {
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                            }      
<<<<<<< HEAD
                            builder.append(url);
                        } else if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength){
                            if (verbose) {
                                System.err.println("[INFO] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI longer than " + maxUriLength + " characters. Skipping.");
                            }

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict
The merge conflict arises in a section of code that handles the case where the length of a URI string exceeds a specified `maxUriLength`. Let's break down the intent and semantics of both sides of the conflict:

- **HEAD (Left Side of Conflict):**
  - Contains a condition `else if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength)` which is redundant because the same condition is already checked in the `if` block directly above.
  - Logs a message as `[INFO]` and describes the issue as the URI being "longer than" a certain number of "characters."
  - The intent appears to be to provide a different log message or handle a similar condition with slightly different wording, but since the condition is identical to the previous `if`, this likely represents a duplicate or outdated branch of logic.

- **Right Side (Commit `790b69a0`):**
  - Does not include any additional condition or logic in the conflict area; it simply continues with `builder.append(url);` under the existing `if` block.
  - There is no conflicting logic or log message on this side within the conflict markers, implying that this side might be sticking to the original structure without the redundant `else if`.

- **Surrounding Context:**
  - The initial `if` block already checks for `maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength` and logs a `[WARNING]` about the URI being "larger than" a certain number of "bytes."
  - The intent of the overall code seems to be to skip processing and append the original URL (`url`) if the URI length exceeds the limit, while providing feedback via logs if verbose mode is enabled.

- **Key Observation on Semantics:**
  - The HEAD side introduces a redundant `else if` with the exact same condition as the initial `if`, which is logically unnecessary. This likely indicates a mistake or an outdated change.
  - The difference in log level (`[WARNING]` vs `[INFO]`) and terminology ("bytes" vs "characters") suggests an intent to refine the messaging, but it's unclear why a second identical condition was added.
  - The right side seems to represent a cleaner or original state without the redundancy.

- **Probable Intent of Both Sides:**
  - Both sides aim to handle the case of skipping URI processing when it exceeds the length limit by appending the original `url` to the `builder`.
  - The HEAD side might be attempting to refine the log message or log level, but the duplicate condition suggests an error in implementation.

### Resolution
Given that the `else if` condition on the HEAD side is redundant (since it's identical to the preceding `if` condition), it is likely a mistake or an artifact of an incomplete change. The most semantically consistent resolution is to remove the redundant `else if` block and retain the original structure. Additionally, since there is a difference in log messaging ("bytes" vs "characters" and `[WARNING]` vs `[INFO]`), I will assume the original log message in the `if` block (from the context) is the intended one unless further context suggests otherwise. The right side does not add conflicting logic, so it aligns with a cleaner resolution.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
                        
                        if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength) {
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                            }      
                            builder.append(url);
                        } else {

                            /*
                             * Determine what to do. Eventually, you should be able to
```

### Rationale for Resolution
- Removed the redundant `else if` block from HEAD since it duplicates the condition already checked in the `if` block, which would never execute due to the logic flow.
- Retained the original log message with `[WARNING]` and "bytes" as it appears in the context and seems to be the baseline unless further intent is clarified.
- Kept the `builder.append(url);` within the original `if` block as it matches the intent of both sides (to append the URL when the length condition fails).
- Preserved the `else` block and subsequent comment as they are outside the conflict area and remain relevant.

If further context or intent (e.g., a need for distinct handling of "bytes" vs "characters") becomes available, this resolution can be revisited. For now, this resolution avoids logical redundancy while maintaining the apparent intent of skipping oversized URIs with appropriate logging.
