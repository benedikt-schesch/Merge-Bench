Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict. The difference between the two versions is a single word: "could" in the `HEAD` version versus "count" in the `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` version. After considering the context, it appears that the intent is to indicate reliance on another instance to read the record. The word "count" seems to align better with this intent, as it implies depending on or trusting another instance to handle the task. Therefore, I will resolve the conflict by adopting the version with "count."

Below is the resolved code snippet with the full context:

```java

    public void bindTo(String fileName, BufferedPositionedInputStream in, long offset, long end) throws IOException {
        this.in = in;
        this.end = end;
        // Since we are not block aligned we throw away the first
        // record and count on a different instance to read it
        if (offset != 0)
            getNext();
    }

    public Tuple getNext() throws IOException {

```
