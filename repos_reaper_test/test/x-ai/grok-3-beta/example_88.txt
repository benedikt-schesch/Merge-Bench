I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent behind the conflicting changes is ambiguous. The two sides of the merge appear to be addressing different functionalities (`blanksLimit` on the HEAD side and password handling on the other side), and it's unclear how these should be combined without additional context about the overall purpose of the code.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
          if (!cardSetId.isEmpty()) {
            cardSets.add((CardSet) game.getHibernateSession().load(CardSet.class,
                Integer.parseInt(cardSetId)));
          }
        }
<<<<<<< HEAD
        final int blanksLimit = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(AjaxRequest.BLANKS_LIMIT));
=======
        final String oldPassword = game.getPassword();
>>>>>>> d03dac9db71fadc7ff2663477514f7d0d10b3d94
        String password = request.getParameter(AjaxRequest.PASSWORD);
        if (password == null) {
          password = "";
        }
        // We're not directly assigning this with Boolean.valueOf() because we want to default to
```
