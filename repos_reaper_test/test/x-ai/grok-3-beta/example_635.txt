I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is since the intent behind the changes in the conflicting section is ambiguous. The conflict involves the presence or absence of the `serialVersionUID` field, but without additional context or understanding of the importance of this field in the specific project or class serialization requirements, it's unclear whether it should be included or omitted.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the full context preserved in markdown code syntax:

```java
   * 
   * @author <a href="http://restfb.com">Norbert Bartels</a>
   */
  public static class UserDevice extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
