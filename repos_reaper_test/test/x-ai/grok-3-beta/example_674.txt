I'll return the snippet with the conflict as is, since the intent behind the changes is ambiguous without additional context about the purpose of `displayName` and `callbackUrl` parameters in the `AccountProviderParameters` constructor. Here's the preserved code snippet with full context:

```java
	}
	
	private AccountProviderParameters getParameters(final String provider) {
		return jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(SELECT_ACCOUNT_PROVIDER_BY_NAME, new RowMapper<AccountProviderParameters>() {
			public AccountProviderParameters mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
				return new AccountProviderParameters(provider, rs.getString("displayName"), encryptor.decrypt(rs
						.getString("apiKey")), encryptor.decrypt(rs.getString("secret")), rs.getLong("appId"), rs
						.getString("requestTokenUrl"), rs.getString("authorizeUrl"), rs.getString("callbackUrl"), rs
						.getString("accessTokenUrl"));
=======
				return new AccountProviderParameters(provider, encryptor.decrypt(rs.getString("apiKey")), encryptor.decrypt(rs.getString("secret")), rs.getLong("appId"), rs.getString("requestTokenUrl"), rs.getString("authorizeUrl"), rs.getString("accessTokenUrl"));
>>>>>>> 228af53d8db4ea1b58282f203bd404a3d011b7a8
			}
		}, provider);
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Explanation of Conflict and Decision to Retain:
- **HEAD Side Intent**: The HEAD version includes additional parameters like `displayName` and `callbackUrl` in the `AccountProviderParameters` constructor. This suggests that the intent might be to enhance the object with more descriptive or functional data.
- **Other Side Intent (228af53d8db4ea1b58282f203bd404a3d011b7a8)**: The other branch omits `displayName` and `callbackUrl`, indicating a possible simplification or a version of the constructor that doesn't require these fields, perhaps due to a different feature set or refactoring.
- **Ambiguity**: Without knowing the exact signature of the `AccountProviderParameters` constructor, the database schema, or the broader application intent (e.g., whether `displayName` and `callbackUrl` are mandatory or legacy fields), it's unclear which version to favor. Merging them incorrectly could break functionality.
- **Decision**: I am retaining the conflict markers to ensure no assumptions are made about the intent. Developers with domain knowledge should resolve this by confirming the correct constructor signature and required fields.

If additional context (e.g., constructor definition or feature requirements) is provided, I can assist in proposing a resolution.
