I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and resolve it based on the intent and semantics of both sides. Below is the original snippet with the conflict markers preserved, as requested, in markdown code syntax. After that, I'll provide my analysis and resolution.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Unmodified)
```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "describe b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict
The conflict arises in the initialization of the `GruntParser` object:
- **HEAD**: Uses `GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));` which suggests a single-argument constructor for `GruntParser` that only takes a `StringReader` for the script input.
- **Branch (2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea)**: Uses `GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);` which includes an additional parameter `myPig`, likely a reference to a Pig context or configuration object required for parsing.

### Semantic Intent
- **HEAD**: Likely represents the original or a simpler version of the code where the `GruntParser` does not require additional context or configuration (`myPig`). The intent seems to be basic parsing of the script without additional dependencies.
- **Branch**: Likely introduces a change where the `GruntParser` needs a reference to a `myPig` object, possibly for enhanced functionality, configuration, or environment setup specific to the Pig execution context. The intent is to ensure the parser operates within a specific Pig context.

### Resolution Rationale
Given that the branch version adds a parameter (`myPig`), it suggests an intentional enhancement or dependency that was introduced in the branch. Simply reverting to the HEAD version might break functionality if `myPig` is necessary for correct parsing or integration with other parts of the codebase (not visible in the snippet). Since there is no indication in the context that `myPig` is optional or unnecessary, the branch's intent should take precedence to avoid potential runtime issues or missing configuration.

Additionally, adopting the branch version does not conflict with the HEAD's intent of initializing a `GruntParser`â€”it merely extends it with an additional parameter. Without further context indicating that `myPig` is irrelevant or causes issues, it's safer to assume the branch change is purposeful.

### Resolved Snippet
```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "describe b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```

### Final Notes
- I have resolved the conflict by adopting the branch version (`GruntParser` with `myPig`) based on the reasoning above.
- The surrounding context remains unchanged as per the instructions.
- If there are concerns about whether `myPig` is defined or necessary in the broader codebase, this resolution assumes it is available and required. If this assumption is incorrect, further context would be needed to revisit the resolution.
