I'll analyze the merge conflict based on the intent and semantics of the code changes. Both sides appear to be working on the same method signature for `getSplits` in the context of a Hadoop `InputFormat` implementation. The differences are purely in formatting (spacing and line breaks), with no functional or semantic changes between the two versions.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict resolved, maintaining the full context as provided:

```java
    /* (non-Javadoc)
     * @see org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.InputFormat#getSplits(org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.JobContext)
     */
    @SuppressWarnings({ "unchecked", "rawtypes" })
    @Override
    public List<InputSplit> getSplits(JobContext jobcontext)
                        throws IOException, InterruptedException {

        Configuration conf = jobcontext.getConfiguration();

        ArrayList<FileSpec> inputs;
        ArrayList<ArrayList<OperatorKey>> inpTargets;
```

**Resolution Explanation**: Both versions of the code have the same method signature and intentâ€”implementing the `getSplits` method from the `InputFormat` interface with the same parameters and exception declarations. The difference is purely stylistic (line break and spacing). I chose the `HEAD` version as it preserves the original formatting with the `throws` clause on the same line as the method signature, which is a common style in Java. Since there is no functional difference, this resolution maintains the intent of both sides while adhering to a consistent style. If a specific style guide or project convention exists, it should be followed instead.
