Let's resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intent and semantics of both sides.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict, preserved exactly as provided:

```java

    protected abstract void helpSetUp() throws Exception;
    public abstract void runScript(final String js) throws Exception;

    @SmallTest
<<<<<<< HEAD:app/src/main/java/com/iwebpp/nodeandroid/test/ActivityInstrumentationTestCase.java
    public void testHelloWorld() throws Exception {
        runScript("Log.d('RhinoTest', 'Helloworld, js');" + "toast('沃草泥马');");
=======
    public void testHelloWorld()
    {
        runScript("Log.d('RhinoTest', 'Helloworld, js');" + "toast('东北人都是活雷锋');");
>>>>>>> c68495f4cd53abab9be74ed6ac6d02cd0248e662:app/src/main/java/com/iwebpp/nodeandroid/test/MainActivityInstrumentationTestCase.java
    }

    /** TODO use TextUtils#concat */
    /**
     *

```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics:
- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The method `testHelloWorld` includes a `throws Exception` declaration, indicating that the method might throw an exception that needs to be handled by the caller. The script inside `runScript` includes a log statement and a toast message with Chinese text "沃草泥马" (a phrase that might be culturally specific or humorous/derogatory depending on context).
- **Right Side (c68495f4)**: The method `testHelloWorld` does not include a `throws Exception` declaration, suggesting it either handles exceptions internally or does not expect to throw any. The script inside `runScript` includes the same log statement but a different toast message with Chinese text "东北人都是活雷锋" (a culturally specific reference, likely humorous or complimentary).
- **Common Intent**: Both sides are testing a JavaScript execution functionality using `runScript`, logging a debug message, and displaying a toast with a culturally specific message. The difference lies in the exception handling declaration and the content of the toast message.
- **Resolution Consideration**: 
  - The `throws Exception` declaration on the HEAD side aligns with the `runScript` method's signature, which also `throws Exception`. Retaining this declaration seems semantically correct as it ensures proper exception propagation.
  - The toast message content appears to be a matter of preference or localization. Without additional context on which message is intended for the final version, a decision must be made based on neutrality or by retaining one as the default. Since both are culturally specific, I'll propose retaining the HEAD side's message for consistency with the exception handling choice, but this could be revisited if the intent is to use a specific message based on project requirements.

### Resolved Code:
Given the above analysis, I propose resolving the conflict by combining the exception declaration from HEAD and choosing one toast message (HEAD's version for consistency). However, if the intent behind the toast message is critical, this can be adjusted based on further input.

Here is the resolved snippet (if you disagree with the toast message choice or need further clarification, the conflict can remain unresolved as per your feedback):

```java

    protected abstract void helpSetUp() throws Exception;
    public abstract void runScript(final String js) throws Exception;

    @SmallTest
    public void testHelloWorld() throws Exception {
        runScript("Log.d('RhinoTest', 'Helloworld, js');" + "toast('沃草泥马');");
    }

    /** TODO use TextUtils#concat */
    /**
     *

```

### Alternative:
If the intent behind the toast message or exception handling is ambiguous or requires stakeholder input, I can retain the conflict as is. Please let me know if you prefer to keep the conflict or if there is additional context to finalize the resolution (e.g., which toast message is intended for the target audience).
