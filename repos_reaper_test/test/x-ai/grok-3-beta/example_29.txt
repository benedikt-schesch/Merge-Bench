I'll preserve the original context and code snippet as provided and analyze the merge conflict based on the intent and semantics of both sides. Below is the unchanged snippet with the conflict markers included, followed by my analysis and resolution.

```java
 * the MIT license.
 */
package org.spout.api.collision;

import org.spout.api.math.ReactConverter;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
=======
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;

>>>>>>> cc0703054530b4eeda07a2b1b619ed34e1e7d201
import org.spout.physics.collision.ContactInfo;

public class SpoutContactInfo {
	private final ContactInfo wrapped;
```

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict
The conflict is in the import statement for a `Vector3` class:
- **HEAD**: Uses `org.spout.math.vector.Vector3`
- **Merged Commit (cc070305...)**: Uses `org.spout.api.math.Vector3`

### Semantic Intent
- The intent on both sides is to import a `Vector3` class, which is likely used for 3D vector mathematics within the context of a collision or physics system (given the package `org.spout.api.collision` and the presence of `ContactInfo`).
- The difference lies in the namespace or package structure:
  - `HEAD` suggests a structure where `Vector3` is located in `org.spout.math.vector`, potentially indicating a more generic or lower-level math library.
  - The merged commit suggests `Vector3` is under `org.spout.api.math`, which may be a higher-level or API-specific abstraction for math utilities.
- Given the context (package `org.spout.api.collision`), it is more semantically consistent to use a class from `org.spout.api.math` since it aligns with the `api` namespace and likely represents the intended public API for use within this module.

### Potential Ambiguity
- Without additional context about the project structure, it is not entirely clear whether `org.spout.math.vector.Vector3` and `org.spout.api.math.Vector3` are the same class (perhaps moved or refactored) or distinct implementations.
- However, since the class name `Vector3` is identical and the surrounding imports (like `ReactConverter` from `org.spout.api.math`) suggest a preference for the `api` namespace, it is reasonable to assume that `org.spout.api.math.Vector3` is the intended import.

### Resolved Code Snippet
Based on semantic consistency with the package structure and surrounding imports, I will resolve the conflict by selecting the import from the merged commit (`org.spout.api.math.Vector3`). Below is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved:

```java
 * the MIT license.
 */
package org.spout.api.collision;

import org.spout.api.math.ReactConverter;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
import org.spout.physics.collision.ContactInfo;

public class SpoutContactInfo {
	private final ContactInfo wrapped;
```

### Justification
- The package `org.spout.api.collision` suggests alignment with other `api` namespace components, making `org.spout.api.math.Vector3` the more contextually appropriate choice.
- If this resolution is incorrect due to project-specific details not visible in the snippet, it can be revisited with additional context. However, based on the provided information, this resolution prioritizes naming consistency and semantic intent.
