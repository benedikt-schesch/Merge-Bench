I'll analyze the merge conflict in terms of intent and semantics.

**Analysis of the Conflict:**

- **HEAD Branch**: Defines `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS` with a pattern for matching hashtags, using `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE` as the only flag. The pattern itself is identical to the one in the other branch.
- **d6ea7853 Branch**: Also defines `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS` with the same pattern, but adds an additional flag `Pattern.UNICODE_CASE` alongside `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE`. Additionally, this branch includes a new constant `SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END` which is not present in the HEAD branch.

**Intent and Semantics**:
- The intent of both branches for `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS` seems to be the same: matching hashtags in text, with case-insensitive behavior. However, the `d6ea7853` branch likely aims to improve internationalization support by adding `Pattern.UNICODE_CASE`, which ensures proper handling of Unicode characters for case-insensitivity.
- The addition of `SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END` in the `d6ea7853` branch suggests an intent to introduce new functionality related to screen name matching, which is not in conflict with the hashtag pattern but is an additional change.

**Resolution**:
- Since both branches are modifying `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS` in a compatible way (same pattern, just an additional flag in `d6ea7853`), the more inclusive approach with `Pattern.UNICODE_CASE` should be adopted for better internationalization.
- The `SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END` constant from `d6ea7853` should be included as it represents additional functionality that does not conflict with the HEAD branch's intent.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved:

```java


  /* Begin public constants */
  public static final Pattern AT_SIGNS = Pattern.compile("[" + AT_SIGNS_CHARS + "]");

  public static final Pattern SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END = Pattern.compile("^(?:[" + AT_SIGNS_CHARS + LATIN_ACCENTS_CHARS + "]|://)");

  public static final Pattern AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS = Pattern.compile("(^|[^&/" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS + "])(#|\uFF03)(" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*" + HASHTAG_ALPHA + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*)", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE | Pattern.UNICODE_CASE);

  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_BEFORE = 1;
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_HASH = 2;
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_TAG = 3;
  public static final Pattern HASHTAG_MATCH_END = Pattern.compile("^(?:[#ï¼ƒ]|://)");
