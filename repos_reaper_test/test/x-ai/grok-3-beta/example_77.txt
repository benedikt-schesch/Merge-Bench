Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics of the conflicting changes require further clarification. I will also explain my reasoning for not resolving the conflict at this stage.

```

### Reasoning:
- **Conflict Overview**: The conflict arises from two different logging frameworks being used. The `HEAD` version uses `org.apache.logging.log4j` (Log4j 2) with both `LogManager` and `Logger`, while the other branch (`5adedd248...`) uses `org.apache.log4j` (Log4j 1) with only `Logger`.
- **Semantic Intent**: 
  - The `HEAD` version likely intends to adopt or upgrade to Log4j 2, which is a more modern and feature-rich logging framework with better performance and configuration options.
  - The other branch appears to stick with Log4j 1, which might be due to compatibility with existing code, dependencies, or a decision to avoid migration.
- **Ambiguity**: Without additional context about the project's logging strategy, dependencies, or whether a migration to Log4j 2 is in progress, it is unclear which version should be chosen. For instance:
  - If the project is upgrading to Log4j 2, the `HEAD` version should be retained.
  - If the project must remain compatible with Log4j 1 (e.g., due to legacy dependencies), the other branch's version should be chosen.
  - Additionally, the `HEAD` version imports `LogManager`, which might be used in the codebase for logger initialization, but it is not clear if this is necessary.
- **Risk of Blind Resolution**: Choosing one version over the other without understanding the broader codebase could introduce runtime errors (e.g., missing dependencies) or break existing logging configurations.

### Conclusion:
The conflict is preserved as is due to ambiguous intent. To resolve this, I recommend consulting with the team or reviewing the project's documentation, build files (e.g., Maven/Gradle dependencies), or commit history to determine the intended logging framework. If a decision cannot be reached, a common approach might be to adopt the more modern Log4j 2 (`HEAD`), but this should be validated against the project's requirements.
