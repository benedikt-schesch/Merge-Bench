I'll resolve the merge conflict by analyzing the intent and semantics of both sides.

**Analysis of Intent:**
- On the `HEAD` side, the `Deferred` type is used without generics, implying a raw type or a context where the specific type parameter is not critical or is inferred.
- On the merge commit `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` side, `Deferred<?>` is used, explicitly indicating a wildcard type, which is a more modern and type-safe approach to handling generics in Java, allowing flexibility while still adhering to type safety.

**Resolution Intent:**
- The intent on both sides appears to be the same: to represent a `Deferred` object that the application can wait on before retrying a failed RPC. The difference lies in the use of generics for better type safety on the merge commit side.
- Resolving in favor of `Deferred<?>` aligns with Java best practices for type safety and is likely the intended modernization of the code.

Here is the resolved code snippet with full context preserved as provided:

```java

  /** The RPC that was failed with this exception.  */
  private final HBaseRpc rpc;

  /** A deferred one can wait on before retrying the failed RPC.  */
  private final Deferred<?> deferred;

  /**
   * Constructor.
   * @param msg A message explaining why the application has to throttle.
   * @param cause The exception that requires the application to throttle

```
