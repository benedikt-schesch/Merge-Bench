Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics behind the conflicting changes are ambiguous without further context about the testing framework or project conventions being used. I will return the snippet exactly as provided, including the full context and spacing, in markdown code syntax.

```java

**Explanation of Ambiguity:**

- **Left Side (HEAD)**: Uses `assertThat` from the AssertJ library, which suggests a preference for a more fluent and descriptive assertion style.
- **Right Side (a17acec...)**: Uses `assertEquals` and `assertNotNull` from JUnit, which are more traditional assertion methods commonly used in JUnit tests.
- **Intent**: It is unclear whether the project has a standardized testing framework or if there was a deliberate switch between AssertJ and JUnit assertions. The choice of assertion library could depend on project conventions, readability preferences, or specific test requirements that are not evident from this snippet alone.
- **Recommendation**: To resolve this, I would need additional context, such as the project's testing guidelines or the nature of the tests being written. If AssertJ is the preferred library across the project, the `HEAD` side should be retained. If JUnit assertions are the standard or if thereâ€™s a mix, the right side could be chosen, or a combination of both libraries might be acceptable. Without this clarity, I am preserving the conflict as is.

If you can provide more context about the testing framework or the intent behind the changes, I can assist in resolving the conflict.
