I'm returning the code snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent behind the differing changes is ambiguous without additional context about the application’s domain or the purpose of the sets being defined. Below, I’ve preserved the exact formatting and context of the provided snippet.

```java
  private final ConnectedUsers connectedUsers;
  private final GameManager gameManager;
  private final Provider<Session> sessionProvider;
  private final Object blackCardLock = new Object();
  private final GameOptions options;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private final Set<Integer> customDecksIds = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<Integer>());
=======
  private final Set<String> cardcastDeckIds = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
  private final Metrics metrics;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showGameLinkProvider;
  private final Provider<String> gamePermalinkFormatProvider;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showRoundLinkProvider;
```

**Analysis and Reasoning:**

- **Conflict Overview**: The conflict arises from two different definitions of a set variable. On the `HEAD` side, it's `customDecksIds` with type `Set<Integer>`, while on the other branch (`5adedd248`), it's `cardcastDeckIds` with type `Set<String>`.
- **Semantic Intent**: 
  - `HEAD` seems to be managing a set of custom deck IDs using integers, implying that deck identifiers are numeric in this context.
  - The other branch uses `cardcastDeckIds` with strings, suggesting a different system (possibly integrating with a service like Cardcast) where deck IDs are represented as strings.
- **Ambiguity**: Without further context about the application (e.g., whether it supports both custom decks and Cardcast decks, or if this is a rename/refactoring), it's unclear whether these are:
  - Two distinct concepts that should both exist (i.e., keep both sets).
  - A single concept that was refactored (i.e., choose one based on the intended system).
  - A type change (Integer to String) due to an update in how IDs are handled.
- **Decision to Not Resolve**: Since the intent cannot be confidently determined, I’ve left the conflict markers in place. Resolving this would require input from the developers or additional context about the codebase (e.g., whether "Cardcast" is a specific feature or if `customDecksIds` was meant to be replaced).

If you can provide more details about the purpose of these sets or the direction of the project, I’d be happy to help resolve the conflict.
