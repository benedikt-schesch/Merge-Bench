Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including all context and spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge to propose a resolution. Following the snippet, I will explain my reasoning.

```java
import com.teleca.jamendo.widget.OnAlbumClickListener;
import com.teleca.jamendo.widget.ProgressBar;
import com.teleca.jamendo.R;

import android.app.Activity;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import android.gesture.GestureOverlayView;
=======
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
>>>>>>> 9963fea7c2a157c44549ee48a96e60f80bc33d51
import android.os.AsyncTask;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.os.Environment;
import android.preference.PreferenceManager;
import android.util.Log;
```

### Analysis and Resolution Reasoning

**Intent of HEAD (Current Branch):**
- The `HEAD` side imports `android.gesture.GestureOverlayView`, suggesting that the code in this branch likely involves gesture-related functionality, such as handling touch gestures in a user interface component. This could be part of a feature to support gesture-based navigation or interaction within the app.

**Intent of 9963fea7c2a (Incoming Branch):**
- The incoming branch imports `android.content.Context` and `android.content.Intent`. These are common Android components often used for managing application context (e.g., accessing system services or resources) and for launching activities or passing data between components. This suggests the incoming branch may focus on broader Android application functionality, such as starting new activities or handling inter-component communication.

**Semantic Merge Resolution:**
- The imports on both sides do not inherently conflict in terms of functionality; they serve different purposes. The `GestureOverlayView` from HEAD is specific to gesture handling, while `Context` and `Intent` from the incoming branch are foundational Android classes likely used for general app operations.
- Since there is no direct overlap or contradiction in the purpose of these imports, and both could reasonably be required by the codebase (especially in an Android app context), the best resolution is to include all imports from both sides.
- There is no evidence in the provided snippet of mutual exclusivity (e.g., one branch removing gesture support while the other adds something incompatible), so combining them preserves the intent of both branches.

**Resolved Code:**
```java
import com.teleca.jamendo.widget.OnAlbumClickListener;
import com.teleca.jamendo.widget.ProgressBar;
import com.teleca.jamendo.R;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.gesture.GestureOverlayView;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.os.AsyncTask;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.os.Environment;
import android.preference.PreferenceManager;
import android.util.Log;
```

### Conclusion
I have resolved the conflict by combining the imports from both branches, as they appear to address different aspects of the application's functionality. If further context or downstream code indicates that one of these imports is unnecessary or introduces issues (e.g., if gesture support was deliberately removed in one branch), this resolution can be revisited. However, based on the provided snippet, this approach best captures the semantic intent of both sides.
