I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is since the intent and semantics need careful consideration. The conflict involves a variable name difference (`myKey` vs `keyWritable`), and without additional context about which name is the current or intended reference (or if they refer to the same object), itâ€™s ambiguous to resolve without potentially introducing errors. Preserving the original conflict allows for further investigation by the developer.

```java
    public Result getNext() throws ExecException {
        if (bags == null) {
            return new Result(POStatus.STATUS_EOP, null);
        }

<<<<<<< HEAD
        byte origIndex = myKey.getIndex();

        byte origIndex = keyWritable.getIndex();

        int index = (int)origIndex;
        index &= idxPart;

        if (index >= packagers.size() || index < 0) {
