I'm returning the provided code snippet with the conflict resolved based on the semantic intent of both sides. The intent of both changes is to document the return value of the method, with the difference being a minor formatting variation in the Javadoc comment. The meaningful content is identical, so I will merge this by adopting the more detailed formatting from the `1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f` branch, as it includes a line break for clarity.

Here is the snippet with the conflict resolved:

```java
    /**
     * Returns the given string if it is non-null; the empty string otherwise.
     * 
     * @param string
     *            the string to test and possibly return
     * @return {@code string} itself if it is non-null; {@code ""} if it is
     *         null.
     */
    public static String nullToEmpty(String string) {
        return (string == null) ? "" : string;
    }
```
