Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as is, including spacing and context. Following that, I will provide an analysis of the conflict and a proposed resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

### Original Snippet with Conflict
```java
        		new DownloadCommentsTask().execute(Constants.DEFAULT_COMMENT_DOWNLOAD_LIMIT);
        		break;
        	case Constants.DIALOG_OPEN_BROWSER:
        		String url = new StringBuilder("http://www.reddit.com/r/")
        			.append(mSettings.subreddit).append("/comments/").append(mSettings.threadId).toString();
<<<<<<< HEAD
        		RedditCommentsListActivity.this.startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url)));
=======
        		Common.launchBrowser(url, RedditCommentsListActivity.this);
>>>>>>> c08e0d7adee3a6c42dfe2887fad422ea332c015e
        		break;
        	case Constants.DIALOG_THEME:
        		if (mSettings.theme == Constants.THEME_LIGHT) {
        			mSettings.setTheme(Constants.THEME_DARK);
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
The merge conflict arises in the `Constants.DIALOG_OPEN_BROWSER` case, where two different approaches are used to open a URL in a browser:
- **HEAD**: Uses `startActivity` with an `Intent.ACTION_VIEW` to open the URL directly using the system's default browser handler. This is a straightforward, standard Android way to open a URL.
- **c08e0d7**: Uses a custom utility method `Common.launchBrowser(url, context)` to open the URL. This likely encapsulates additional logic or customization for launching the browser (e.g., error handling, custom browser selection, or logging).

**Intent**:
- Both sides aim to open the constructed Reddit URL in a browser for the user to view the comments thread.
- The difference lies in the implementation: one uses a direct Android API call, while the other uses a utility method that might offer abstraction or additional functionality.

**Semantic Resolution**:
- Given that `Common.launchBrowser` is likely a utility method designed to handle browser launching in a consistent or app-specific way, it is reasonable to prefer this over the raw `startActivity` call. This assumes that `Common.launchBrowser` is a well-tested, reusable method within the codebase that aligns with the app's design patterns.
- If there is no additional context suggesting otherwise (e.g., `Common.launchBrowser` being deprecated or problematic), adopting the utility method promotes code consistency and maintainability.

### Resolved Snippet
```java
        		new DownloadCommentsTask().execute(Constants.DEFAULT_COMMENT_DOWNLOAD_LIMIT);
        		break;
        	case Constants.DIALOG_OPEN_BROWSER:
        		String url = new StringBuilder("http://www.reddit.com/r/")
        			.append(mSettings.subreddit).append("/comments/").append(mSettings.threadId).toString();
        		Common.launchBrowser(url, RedditCommentsListActivity.this);
        		break;
        	case Constants.DIALOG_THEME:
        		if (mSettings.theme == Constants.THEME_LIGHT) {
        			mSettings.setTheme(Constants.THEME_DARK);
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

**Note**: The unresolved conflict marker at the end of the snippet (for `Constants.DIALOG_THEME`) appears incomplete in the provided input (missing the corresponding `=======` and `>>>>>>>` markers). Since it was not part of the primary conflict under discussion and the input ends abruptly, I have left it as is in the resolved snippet. If this is part of another conflict, it would need separate resolution based on additional context.

If you disagree with the resolution or have additional context about the codebase (e.g., whether `Common.launchBrowser` is the preferred approach), please let me know, and I can adjust accordingly.
