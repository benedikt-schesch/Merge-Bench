Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, in markdown code syntax. I will also explain my thought process regarding the conflict resolution.

```java
  private CustomCardFormatHelper() {
  }

  public static String formatBlackCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // TODO this is going to need some work to look pretty.
<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomCardFormatHelper.java
    final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.size());
=======
    final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/cardcast/CardcastFormatHelper.java
    for (final Object o : textParts) {
      strs.add((String) o);
    }
    final String text = StringUtils.join(strs, "____");
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml11(text);
```

### Thought Process on Merge Conflict Resolution

#### Analysis of Intent and Semantics:
- **HEAD (CustomCardFormatHelper.java):** Uses `textParts.size()` to initialize the capacity of the `ArrayList`. This suggests that the intent is to pre-allocate the list size based on the number of elements in `textParts`, which is a common optimization to avoid resizing the list during population. The method `size()` is likely a custom or specific method for the `JSONArray` or a related wrapper in this context.
- **Other Branch (CardcastFormatHelper.java):** Uses `textParts.length()` to initialize the capacity of the `ArrayList`. This suggests that `textParts` is treated as an array-like structure (or `JSONArray` with a `length()` method) and aims for the same optimization of pre-allocating space. The use of `length()` might align with a different API or implementation of `JSONArray` in this branch, or it might reflect a naming convention preference.
- **Shared Intent:** Both sides of the merge conflict aim to optimize the initialization of the `ArrayList` by setting an initial capacity equal to the number of elements in `textParts`. The difference lies in the method used to retrieve the size (`size()` vs. `length()`), which could be due to API differences, naming conventions, or library versions.

#### Resolution Considerations:
- **Ambiguity:** Without additional context about the exact implementation of `JSONArray` in both branches (e.g., whether `size()` and `length()` are interchangeable or if one is deprecated or incorrect), it is unclear which method is the correct one to use. If `JSONArray` is from a library like `org.json`, `length()` is typically the method to use for size, but custom implementations or wrappers might use `size()`.
- **File Names:** The filenames (`CustomCardFormatHelper.java` vs. `CardcastFormatHelper.java`) suggest that these might be different classes or implementations, but the method signature and surrounding code are identical, implying a refactoring or rename. This adds to the ambiguity, as the conflict may also stem from integration of two distinct but similar codebases.
- **Risk of Incorrect Resolution:** Choosing one over the other without knowing the correct API or context could introduce a runtime error if the chosen method does not exist or returns an incorrect value.

#### Decision:
Due to the ambiguity in determining which method (`size()` or `length()`) is correct for the `JSONArray` object in this context, I am choosing to preserve the merge conflict as is. A proper resolution would require additional information about the `JSONArray` implementation, the library version, or the intended behavior of the codebase. If forced to resolve without context, I would lean towards `length()` as it is more common in JSON-related APIs, but this is speculative and risky.

If you can provide further context (e.g., the `JSONArray` implementation details or which branch represents the latest or authoritative version), I can attempt a more definitive resolution. For now, the snippet is returned with the conflict intact as requested.
