I'm returning the code snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent and semantics of both sides are ambiguous without additional context. The left side (HEAD) includes additional imports and a field declaration with a TODO comment, suggesting a focus on expanding functionality or documentation. The right side (77ca2cb...) appears to have been removed or modified significantly in the HEAD, but introduces a constructor with initialization logic. Without further information on the intended structure or purpose of the class, it's unclear how to resolve this conflict semantically.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict markers preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax:

```java
import org.spout.api.Engine;
import org.spout.api.Spout;
import org.spout.api.plugin.Plugin;
import org.spout.api.plugin.PluginDescriptionFile;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.spout.api.plugin.PluginLoader;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Protocol;

public final class SpoutMetaPlugin implements Plugin {
	private PluginDescriptionFile pdf;
	private Engine engine;
	private PluginDictionary dictionary; // TODO extend this dictionary to load translation from a different location
=======
>>>>>>> 77ca2cb827b0a0b10f18d609fa5fd707c62376f7

public final class SpoutMetaPlugin extends Plugin {
	public SpoutMetaPlugin(Engine engine) {
		this.engine = engine;
		file = new File(engine.getClass().getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().getPath().replaceAll("%20", " "));
```
