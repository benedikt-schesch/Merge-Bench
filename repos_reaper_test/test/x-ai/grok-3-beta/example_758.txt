Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict included, preserved exactly as given with original spacing and context. Following that, I will explain my reasoning for the resolution of the conflict based on semantics and intent.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Unchanged)
```java
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class ExitHookTest {

    private static final int KEY = 1;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final int JVM_STARTUP_WAIT_TIME_MS = 5_000;
=======
    private static final int JVM_STARTUP_WAIT_TIME_MS = 2_000;
>>>>>>> 67b612c2568b82917bb090cac5046a34462e9d24
    private static final String PRE_SHUTDOWN_ACTION_EXECUTED = "PRE_SHUTDOWN_ACTION_EXECUTED";
    private static final String USER_SHUTDOWN_HOOK_EXECUTED = "USER_SHUTDOWN_HOOK_EXECUTED";

    @Rule
    public TemporaryFolder folder = new TemporaryFolder();

```

### Reasoning for Conflict Resolution
The conflict arises over the value of `JVM_STARTUP_WAIT_TIME_MS`, a constant that likely represents a timeout or waiting period in milliseconds for JVM startup in a test scenario. The two values in conflict are:
- `5,000` (from HEAD)
- `2,000` (from commit `67b612c2568b82917bb090cac5046a34462e9d24`)

#### Semantic Analysis and Intent:
- **HEAD (5,000 ms)**: This value suggests a longer wait time, possibly to ensure the JVM has fully started or to account for slower environments or more complex test setups. The intent might be to prioritize reliability over speed, reducing the chance of test failures due to insufficient startup time.
- **Other Branch (2,000 ms)**: This value indicates a shorter wait time, likely aiming to optimize test execution speed. The intent here might be to make tests run faster, assuming that 2,000 ms is sufficient for JVM startup in the targeted environments.
- **Context**: The class `ExitHookTest` appears to be a test class (given the import of `org.junit.Assert` and the use of `@Rule` for a `TemporaryFolder`). The constant is related to JVM startup timing, which is often a balance between reliability (longer wait) and efficiency (shorter wait) in test environments. There are no other clues in the provided context about specific requirements for this wait time.

#### Resolution Decision:
Since the intent of both sides involves a wait time for JVM startup in a test context, and there is no clear indication of external constraints (e.g., specific hardware or environment requirements), I propose resolving this conflict by choosing a middle-ground value to balance reliability and efficiency. A value of `3,500` ms could serve as a compromise, providing a reasonable wait time that is neither too short (risking test failures) nor too long (slowing down test execution unnecessarily). However, if the specific requirements for this wait time are critical (e.g., based on empirical testing or environment specifics), this decision should be revisited with input from the developers involved in both branches.

#### Resolved Snippet:
```java
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class ExitHookTest {

    private static final int KEY = 1;
    private static final int JVM_STARTUP_WAIT_TIME_MS = 3_500;
    private static final String PRE_SHUTDOWN_ACTION_EXECUTED = "PRE_SHUTDOWN_ACTION_EXECUTED";
    private static final String USER_SHUTDOWN_HOOK_EXECUTED = "USER_SHUTDOWN_HOOK_EXECUTED";

    @Rule
    public TemporaryFolder folder = new TemporaryFolder();

```

### Final Note
If the wait time is critical to the test's behavior and the choice between 2,000 ms and 5,000 ms is based on specific testing or environmental factors not evident in the provided context, I recommend discussing with the contributors of both branches to confirm the appropriate value. If there is ambiguity or disagreement, the original conflicted snippet (as shown above) should be retained until further clarification is obtained. For now, I have provided a resolved version with a compromise value based on the assumed intent.
