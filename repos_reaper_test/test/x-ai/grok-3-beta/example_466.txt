I'll analyze the merge conflict and then provide the code snippet as requested.

**Analysis of the Conflict:**

- **HEAD (Left Side):** The method signature is `measureUser(TestUser user, ResultList recommendations, Context context)`. It calls `goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, context.recommender, user)`.
- **Incoming Change (Right Side):** The method signature is modified to `measureUser(TestUser user, int targetLength, ResultList recommendations, Context context)`. It calls `goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, user)`.

**Intent and Semantics:**
- The left side (HEAD) seems to focus on measuring user metrics using a recommender-specific context, as indicated by the inclusion of `context.recommender` in the `selectItems` call.
- The right side introduces a new parameter `targetLength`, which might be used to control the number of items or recommendations being measured, and simplifies the `selectItems` call by excluding the `recommender` parameter.
- The conflict revolves around whether to include the `targetLength` parameter and how to handle the `selectItems` call.

Since the intent of `targetLength` is unclear without further context (e.g., whether it affects the logic inside the method or is just a pass-through parameter), and the difference in `selectItems` parameters might indicate a significant semantic change (e.g., whether the recommender context is necessary for selecting items), I will not attempt to resolve the conflict. This ensures that no assumptions are made that could alter the intended functionality.

As requested, I am returning the snippet with the conflict unresolved, preserving the original formatting and context.

```java
        return new AggregateResult(context).withSuffix(suffix);
    }

    @Override

        LongSet good = goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, context.recommender, user);

        if (good.isEmpty()) {

        }
