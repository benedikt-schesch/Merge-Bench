Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, presented in markdown code syntax as requested. I have not modified the context or spacing. Following the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the conflict and suggest a resolution.

```java
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
<<<<<<< HEAD
        animate().translationX(params.leftMargin).setDuration(SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
=======
        animate().translationX(params.leftMargin).setDuration(
                SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
    }

    public void hideWidgets() {
        mIsHidden = true;
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **Conflict Overview**: The merge conflict occurs in the `notifySidebarSlideOpen()` method, specifically in the line that handles the animation duration setting and starting the animation. The difference between the two versions is purely in the formatting of the `setDuration()` method call.
  - **HEAD**: The code is written on a single line: `animate().translationX(params.leftMargin).setDuration(SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();`
  - **Incoming Commit (c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c)**: The code breaks the `setDuration()` call to a new line with indentation: `animate().translationX(params.leftMargin).setDuration(\n                SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();`
  
- **Semantic Intent**: Both sides of the conflict are functionally identical. They perform the same operation—animating a sidebar by translating it to the `leftMargin` position with a specified duration (`SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS`) and starting the animation. The difference is purely stylistic and related to code formatting (line break and indentation).

- **Resolution Reasoning**: Since there is no functional difference between the two versions, the resolution can be based on coding style preferences or team guidelines. For consistency and readability, I suggest adopting the single-line format from `HEAD` as it is more compact and avoids unnecessary line breaks unless the line length exceeds a typical style guide limit (e.g., 80 or 120 characters). However, if the project follows a style guide that prefers breaking long method chains into multiple lines (as in the incoming commit), that should be respected.

### Resolved Code Snippet

Since the intent is clear and the difference is stylistic, I will provide a resolved version below, choosing the `HEAD` version for compactness. If a different style guide applies, the other version can be chosen instead.

```java
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
        animate().translationX(params.leftMargin).setDuration(SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
    }

    public void hideWidgets() {
        mIsHidden = true;
```

### Final Note

If the project's coding style or line length rules dictate the multi-line format, the incoming commit's version should be used instead. If there’s ambiguity in the style guide or team preference, I recommend discussing with the team or referring to any existing style guidelines before finalizing the resolution.
