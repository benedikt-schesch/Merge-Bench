I'll analyze the merge conflict in terms of intent and semantics. The conflict is about how the `args` (presumably a `List<String>` or similar collection) is being converted or wrapped into `wrappedArgs` to be passed to a vararg constructor expecting a `String[].class`.

- **HEAD side**: Explicitly converts `args` to a `String[]` using `toArray(new String[0])` before wrapping it into `wrappedArgs`. This ensures type safety and compatibility with the constructor expecting a `String[]`.
- **Branch side (1488b22)**: Directly assigns `args` to `wrappedArgs[0]`, which might be problematic if `args` is not already a `String[]`, as the constructor expects a `String[].class`. This could lead to a runtime error if the types don't match.

**Intent Analysis**: The intent of both sides is to pass the arguments to a vararg constructor. However, the HEAD side is more explicit and safer in ensuring the type conversion to `String[]`, which aligns with the constructor signature. The branch side might work if `args` is already a `String[]`, but it's less robust and could fail if `args` is a different collection type.

**Resolution**: I will adopt the HEAD side's approach as it is semantically more correct and safer, ensuring the type matches what the constructor expects.

Here is the entire snippet with the resolved conflict:

```java
        }
        catch(NoSuchMethodException nme) {
            // Second channce. Try with var arg constructor
            try {
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(String[].class);
                String[] argArr = args.toArray(new String[0]) ;
                Object[] wrappedArgs = new Object[1] ;
                wrappedArgs[0] = argArr ;
                ret =  c.newInstance(wrappedArgs);
            }
            catch(Throwable e){
                // bad luck
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
```
