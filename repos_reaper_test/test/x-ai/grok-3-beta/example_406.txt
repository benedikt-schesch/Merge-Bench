I'll provide the snippet with the conflict resolved based on the semantic intent of both sides. Both sides are attempting to save the current player's display name into the `Bundle` when a connection to the game client exists. The difference is in the API usage to access the current player.

Looking at the semantics:
- The `HEAD` version uses `Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer()` which appears to be an older or different API call.
- The `467f0adf` version uses a more direct `getCurrentPlayer()` method on the game client object, which is likely a newer or refactored API.

Since both aim to achieve the same result (getting the current player's display name), I'll resolve this by choosing the more modern or direct approach from the `467f0adf` branch, assuming it reflects an updated API.

Here is the resolved snippet with full context preserved:

```java
	@Override
	public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
		super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
		try {
			if (((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC().isConnected())
				outState.putString("player", ((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC()
						.getCurrentPlayer().getDisplayName());
			else
				outState.remove("player");
		} catch (Exception e) {
			if (Logger.LOG)
				Logger.log(e);
		}
```
