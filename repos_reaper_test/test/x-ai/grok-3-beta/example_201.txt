Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including spacing and context, followed by my analysis of the intent and semantics for resolution. Since the conflict appears to be a result of empty changes or a misunderstanding in the merge, I will provide a resolution based on the surrounding context. If the intent remains ambiguous, I will retain the conflict markers as is.

```java
    }
        
    public PigContext(ExecType execType, Properties properties){
        this.execType = execType;
        this.properties = properties;

        String pigJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(Main.class);
        String hadoopJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(FileSystem.class);
        if (pigJar != null) {
            skipJars.add(pigJar);
            if (!pigJar.equals(hadoopJar))
```

### Analysis and Resolution
Upon reviewing the merge conflict, it appears that both sides of the merge (HEAD and the commit `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) have no additional code or changes within the conflicting section. The conflict markers surround empty lines, indicating that there is no actual content being added or removed by either side in this specific conflict area. The surrounding context suggests that this is part of a constructor definition for `PigContext` in a Java class, initializing some properties and handling JAR file paths for Pig and Hadoop.

**Intent and Semantics:**
- **HEAD side**: No changes or additional code are introduced in this conflict area (empty content).
- **Other side (commit 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309)**: Similarly, no changes or additional code are introduced in this conflict area (empty content).
- **Surrounding Context**: The constructor initializes `execType` and `properties`, then proceeds to handle JAR file paths. The conflict does not interfere with the logic after the conflict markers, which deals with adding JARs to a `skipJars` collection.

Since neither side introduces any conflicting or additional code in the conflicted region, the intent of both sides appears to be aligned with maintaining the existing structure of the constructor. The conflict might have arisen due to a merge tool misinterpreting line changes or whitespace, or it could be a placeholder conflict with no actual semantic difference.

**Resolved Code Snippet:**
As there is no actual content conflict, the resolution is to remove the conflict markers and retain the original surrounding code unchanged. Below is the resolved snippet with conflict markers removed:

```java
    }
        
    public PigContext(ExecType execType, Properties properties){
        this.execType = execType;
        this.properties = properties;   
        String pigJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(Main.class);
        String hadoopJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(FileSystem.class);
        if (pigJar != null) {
            skipJars.add(pigJar);
            if (!pigJar.equals(hadoopJar))
```

### Conclusion
The resolution is straightforward since there is no semantic difference between the two sides of the conflict. If there is additional context or hidden intent not visible in this snippet (e.g., deleted lines or comments that were part of the original changes), please provide further details, and I can revisit the resolution. If the conflict persists or if there’s ambiguity not captured here, the original conflicted snippet can be retained as is for manual review. However, based on the given information, removing the conflict markers aligns with the apparent intent of maintaining the constructor’s logic.
