Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given with all context and spacing intact. Following that, I will explain my analysis of the intent and semantics behind both sides of the merge conflict and propose a resolution based on that analysis.

### Original Code Snippet with Conflict

```java
import android.util.Log;
import android.view.animation.AccelerateInterpolator;
import android.view.animation.DecelerateInterpolator;
import android.widget.FrameLayout;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import fr.xplod.focal.R;
=======
import org.cyanogenmod.focal.R;
import org.cyanogenmod.focal.Util;
>>>>>>> d28bc96faf3c28942720eaef1a486d601352d2d5
import org.cyanogenmod.focal.widgets.WidgetBase;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

The merge conflict in this code snippet arises from differences in the import statements for the `R` resource class and an additional utility class `Util`. Let's analyze the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (Current Branch)**: The import statement `import fr.xplod.focal.R;` suggests that the codebase on this branch is using a package namespace `fr.xplod.focal` for the `R` class, which typically represents the resource IDs generated by the Android build system. This indicates that the project might be structured under this namespace or is a fork/original version using this package name.
  
- **Incoming Branch (d28bc96faf3c28942720eaef1a486d601352d2d5)**: The imports `import org.cyanogenmod.focal.R;` and `import org.cyanogenmod.focal.Util;` indicate that this branch is using a different namespace, `org.cyanogenmod.focal`, for the `R` class and additionally imports a `Util` class from the same package. This suggests that the project might have been adapted or integrated into the CyanogenMod ecosystem, or it could be a rebranded or forked version with a different package structure.

**Semantic Intent**:
- Both sides are trying to import the `R` class, which is essential for accessing resource IDs in an Android project. The difference lies in the package namespace, which likely reflects a structural or branding change in the codebase.
- The incoming branch also adds a `Util` class import, which does not conflict with anything on the HEAD side and appears to be an additional dependency required by the changes in that branch.

**Resolution Strategy**:
- The primary decision is which namespace to adopt for the `R` class. Since the surrounding imports (e.g., `org.cyanogenmod.focal.widgets.WidgetBase`) in the unchanged context align with the `org.cyanogenmod.focal` namespace, it is reasonable to infer that the project has likely transitioned to this namespace. Therefore, adopting `org.cyanogenmod.focal.R` seems more consistent with the current codebase structure.
- The additional `Util` import from the incoming branch should be retained as it introduces no conflict and is likely needed for functionality introduced in that branch.

### Resolved Code Snippet

```java
import android.util.Log;
import android.view.animation.AccelerateInterpolator;
import android.view.animation.DecelerateInterpolator;
import android.widget.FrameLayout;

import org.cyanogenmod.focal.R;
import org.cyanogenmod.focal.Util;
import org.cyanogenmod.focal.widgets.WidgetBase;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
```

### Explanation of Resolution

I resolved the conflict by selecting the `org.cyanogenmod.focal.R` import over `fr.xplod.focal.R` because the surrounding context (specifically, the import of `org.cyanogenmod.focal.widgets.WidgetBase`) suggests that the codebase is structured under the `org.cyanogenmod.focal` namespace. This choice aligns with the apparent intent of maintaining consistency in package naming across the project. Additionally, I included the `org.cyanogenmod.focal.Util` import from the incoming branch as it introduces no conflict and likely supports functionality added in that branch. If the namespace choice is incorrect (e.g., if `fr.xplod.focal` is the intended package for this specific module), this resolution should be revisited with input from the project maintainers.
