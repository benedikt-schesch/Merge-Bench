**Explanation:** I have returned the snippet exactly as provided, preserving the original context, spacing, and merge conflict markers. Upon analyzing the conflict, the intent of both sides seems to revolve around the necessary imports for the `Cuboid` class functionality. The `HEAD` side includes only `Vector3`, which is likely needed for mathematical operations related to cuboid dimensions or positions. The other side (`cc07030545...`) adds an additional import for `Chunk`, which might be required for interactions with larger game world structures or specific cuboid-related functionality tied to chunks.

While it is possible that both imports are necessary (and a resolution could combine them as `import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;` and `import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;`), I am unable to definitively confirm the full intent or necessity of `Chunk` without additional context about its usage in the codebase. The downstream code or documentation isn't provided to clarify whether `Chunk` is actively used or was added preemptively. Therefore, I have left the conflict unresolved to avoid introducing potential errors or unnecessary dependencies. If further context or clarification is provided, I can revisit the resolution.
