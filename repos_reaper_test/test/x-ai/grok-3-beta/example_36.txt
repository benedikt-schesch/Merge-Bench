Let me analyze this merge conflict and resolve it based on the semantics and intent of both sides.

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict

- **HEAD**: The method signature omits the `String commandName` parameter, indicating that the version on the HEAD branch does not consider the command name as a necessary parameter for this overload of the `usage` method.
- **Incoming branch (a647950)**: The method signature includes the `String commandName` parameter, and the method body is enclosed in curly braces `{}` with proper formatting.

### Intent and Semantics
- The intent of the HEAD branch seems to be providing a simpler overload of the `usage` method that does not require a `commandName`.
- The intent of the incoming branch is to maintain the `commandName` parameter, likely because it is needed for specific formatting or logic in the usage output (as seen in the context of the method body with comments like "NAME").
- Given the context of the code (a method named `usage` that outputs command usage information), the `commandName` parameter seems semantically important for correctly identifying or displaying the command's name in the output.

### Resolution Decision
Since the method body in the incoming branch is consistent with using the `commandName` (based on the formatting intent), and the HEAD branch simply omits it (possibly introducing an overload), it is safer to retain the `commandName` parameter to avoid breaking dependent code that relies on this parameter. Additionally, the formatting in the incoming branch (with curly braces) aligns better with typical Java coding style.

Thus, I will resolve the conflict by accepting the incoming branch's method signature while preserving the exact context and spacing as provided.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the resolved conflict:

```java
    public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, String commandName, CommandMetadata command, StringBuilder out)
    {
        usage(programName, groupName, commandName, command, new UsagePrinter(out, columnSize));
    }

    public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, String commandName, CommandMetadata command, UsagePrinter out)
    {
        //
        // NAME
        //
        out.append("NAME").newline();
```
