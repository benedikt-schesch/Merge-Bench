Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I will also provide an analysis of the intent and semantics behind both sides of the merge conflict to attempt a resolution.

```java
        enableBlacklist = settings.getBoolean("EnableBlacklist", false);
        enableWhitelist = settings.getBoolean("EnableWhitelist", false);
        enableLog = settings.getBoolean("EnableLog", false);
        batteryLevel = settings.getInt("BatteryLevel", 0);
        alertPhoneNumber = settings.getString("AlertPhoneNumber", "");
<<<<<<< HEAD
        smsReportDelivery = settings.getBoolean("SmsReportDelivery", false);
=======
        messageResultsAPIEnable = settings.getBoolean("MessageResultsAPIEnable", false);
>>>>>>> bc9125dc30f2833e4ac24ec01ecf1db7debbbf77
    }

### Analysis and Resolution Attempt

**Intent and Semantics Analysis:**
- **HEAD (smsReportDelivery):** The code on the HEAD side introduces a setting for `smsReportDelivery`, which appears to be related to enabling or disabling delivery reports for SMS messages. The intent likely pertains to controlling whether the application should request or handle delivery reports for sent SMS messages.
- **Incoming Commit (messageResultsAPIEnable):** The incoming commit (bc9125dc30f2833e4ac24ec01ecf1db7debbbf77) introduces a setting for `messageResultsAPIEnable`, which seems to be related to enabling an API for message results, possibly for tracking or retrieving the status of sent messages through an external or internal API.

**Conflict Assessment:**
The conflict arises because the two changes are modifying the same section of code (settings initialization), but they are introducing different settings with potentially related but distinct purposes. There is no overlap in the variable names or keys used (`SmsReportDelivery` vs `MessageResultsAPIEnable`), which suggests that both settings could coexist without technical conflict. The primary question is whether both features are intended to be part of the final codebase or if one supersedes the other.

**Resolution Proposal:**
Since the two settings appear to serve related but different purposes (one for SMS delivery reports, another for an API-based message results mechanism), and there is no clear indication that one should replace the other, I propose including both settings in the resolved code. This approach preserves the intent of both sides of the merge, assuming that both features are desired in the final product. If the intent was for one to replace the other (e.g., if `messageResultsAPIEnable` is a newer implementation meant to obsolete `smsReportDelivery`), additional context or documentation would be needed to confirm this.

**Resolved Code Snippet (Proposed):**

```java
        enableBlacklist = settings.getBoolean("EnableBlacklist", false);
        enableWhitelist = settings.getBoolean("EnableWhitelist", false);
        enableLog = settings.getBoolean("EnableLog", false);
        batteryLevel = settings.getInt("BatteryLevel", 0);
        alertPhoneNumber = settings.getString("AlertPhoneNumber", "");
        smsReportDelivery = settings.getBoolean("SmsReportDelivery", false);
        messageResultsAPIEnable = settings.getBoolean("MessageResultsAPIEnable", false);
    }

    /**
     * Save settings changes.
     *
```

**Note:** If there is additional context (e.g., commit messages, feature documentation, or team discussion) indicating that only one of these settings should be retained, or if they are mutually exclusive due to design or architecture constraints, the resolution should be revisited. For now, I have opted to include both to avoid loss of intended functionality. If you or the team can provide further clarification on the intended behavior, I can adjust the resolution accordingly.
