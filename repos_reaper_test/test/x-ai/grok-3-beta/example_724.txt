I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. The conflict is in the `isEquals` method, and I'll consider the intent and semantics of both versions to resolve it. Below, I will provide the entire snippet with the conflict resolved based on the analysis of intent.

First, let's understand the two versions:
- **HEAD version**: Checks if `obj1` is not null before calling `equals()` on it to avoid a `NullPointerException`, and returns whether `obj1` equals `obj2`. If `obj1` is null, it returns true only if `obj2` is also null.
- **Commit 41bc0309 version**: Uses a ternary operator to achieve the same logic more concisely. If `a` is null, it checks if `b` is also null; otherwise, it calls `a.equals(b)`.

**Analysis of Intent**: Both versions aim to safely compare two objects for equality, handling null cases to avoid `NullPointerException`. The logic is semantically identical:
- If the first object is null, return true only if the second object is also null.
- If the first object is not null, call `equals()` to compare with the second object.

The difference is purely stylistic: the HEAD version uses an if-else structure with explicit variable names `obj1` and `obj2`, while the other version uses a ternary operator with more generic names `a` and `b`. Since the behavior is identical, I will favor the more concise and readable version from commit `41bc0309ba863dbff4e537b458048d65f4238312`, but I'll adopt the more descriptive variable names from HEAD for clarity.

Here is the resolved code snippet with the full context preserved as provided:

```java

    public static boolean isLeast(int[] objs, int count) {
        return null != objs && objs.length >= count;
    }

    public static boolean isEquals(Object obj1, Object obj2) {
        return (obj1 == null) ? (obj2 == null) : obj1.equals(obj2);
    }

    public static String trim(CharSequence charSequence) {
        return null == charSequence ? null : charSequence.toString().trim();
    }

```
