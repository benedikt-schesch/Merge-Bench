I'm returning the snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent behind the differing code is ambiguous without additional context. The conflict involves a difference in the texture parameter used for initializing the `SpriteBatch` object (`mBitmapTexture` vs. `mBitmapTextureAtlas`), and I cannot definitively determine which one aligns with the intended functionality or whether a different resolution is needed. Below is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, presented in markdown code syntax as provided.

```java
		
		faceSprite1.setScale(2);
		faceSprite2.setRotation(45);

		/* Create the face and add it to the scene. */
<<<<<<< HEAD
		final SpriteBatch dynamicSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTexture, 2) {
=======
		final SpriteBatch dynamicSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, 2) {

			@Override
			public void onDrawSpriteBatch() {
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
				this.draw(faceSprite2);
			}
```
