Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, formatted in markdown code syntax without any modifications to the context or spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict, and below the snippet, I will explain my thought process. However, since the resolution might be ambiguous due to variable naming discrepancies and unclear intent, I am returning the snippet unchanged.

```java
        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "403\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
=======
    assertNull(ge.getDetails());
    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("403"));
>>>>>>> 47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613
  }

  public void testFrom_detailsErrorObject() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport("{\"error\": {\"message\": \"invalid_token\"}, \"error_description\": \"Invalid value\"}", Json.MEDIA_TYPE);
    HttpRequest request =
```

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict

#### Intent and Semantics:
- **HEAD (Left Side):** The code on the HEAD side uses `responseException` as the variable name for the `GoogleJsonResponseException` object. It asserts that the details of the exception are `null` and checks if the exception message exactly matches a predefined string that includes "403" and the URL. The intent appears to be a precise validation of the error message format.
- **Branch (Right Side, commit 47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613):** The code on this side uses `ge` as the variable name, which is likely intended to refer to the same `GoogleJsonResponseException` object (possibly a shorthand or typo for "google exception"). It also asserts that the details are `null` but only checks if the exception message starts with "403", which is a more lenient check compared to the HEAD side. The intent here seems to focus on ensuring the status code is present without validating the full message.

#### Challenges in Resolution:
1. **Variable Naming Discrepancy:** The right side uses `ge` while the left side uses `responseException`. While it is likely that `ge` is a typo or shorthand for the same object, this cannot be confirmed without additional context about the codebase or naming conventions. Resolving this by assuming `ge` should be `responseException` risks introducing an error if `ge` refers to a different object not visible in the provided snippet.
2. **Different Assertion Logic:** The HEAD side expects an exact match of the error message, including the URL, while the right side only checks if the message starts with "403". The semantic intent differs: one prioritizes exact formatting, and the other focuses on the status code alone. Without knowing the broader purpose of the test, it's unclear which assertion is more appropriate.
3. **Ambiguity in Desired Behavior:** It's unclear whether the test should enforce a strict message format (HEAD intent) or a partial match (branch intent). This could depend on the requirements of the application or test suite, which are not provided in the context.

#### Conclusion:
Due to the ambiguity in variable naming (`ge` vs. `responseException`) and the differing intents behind the assertion logic, I am unable to confidently resolve the merge conflict without additional context. Introducing a resolution risks aligning with the wrong intent or introducing a bug. Therefore, I have preserved the conflict markers in the snippet as provided. If further clarification on the variable naming or the desired test behavior is available, I can revisit this for resolution.

If you have additional context or guidance on the expected behavior or variable naming, please provide it, and I will be happy to assist further.
