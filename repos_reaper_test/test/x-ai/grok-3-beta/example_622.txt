I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet with the conflict unchanged since the intent behind the changes requires further clarification.

```java
    }

    try {
      List<MessageTag> resultList = new ArrayList<MessageTag>();
      JsonObject rawMessageTagsObject = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(rawTags, JsonObject.class);
<<<<<<< HEAD
      for (String key : rawMessageTagsObject.names()) {
=======
      for (String key : getNames(rawMessageTagsObject)) {
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
        String tagArrayString = rawMessageTagsObject.get(key).toString();
        resultList.addAll(jsonMapper.toJavaList(tagArrayString, MessageTag.class));
      }
      return resultList;
    } catch (FacebookJsonMappingException je) {

```

**Analysis of the Conflict:**

- **HEAD (Left Side):** Uses `rawMessageTagsObject.names()` directly to iterate over the keys of the `JsonObject`. This suggests that the `JsonObject` class has a method `names()` which returns a collection of keys, likely as a part of its API.
- **Incoming Change (Right Side):** Uses `getNames(rawMessageTagsObject)` which implies that either the API of `JsonObject` has changed (e.g., `names()` method was replaced or removed), or there is a helper/utility method `getNames()` introduced to retrieve the keys, possibly for abstraction or compatibility reasons.

**Intent and Semantics:**

- Both sides aim to iterate over the keys of the `JsonObject` to process associated values into a list of `MessageTag` objects.
- The difference lies in how the keys are accessed, which could be due to a change in the library/API or a deliberate abstraction on one branch.
- Without additional context about the `JsonObject` class or the codebase (e.g., whether `getNames()` is a custom method or part of a library update), it's ambiguous to decide which approach is correct. Choosing one over the other risks breaking compatibility or ignoring an intentional design change.

**Resolution Decision:**

I am leaving the conflict unresolved in the snippet because the intent behind the change from `names()` to `getNames()` is not clear. Resolving this would require:
1. Confirmation of whether `JsonObject.names()` is still a valid method in the current library version.
2. Understanding if `getNames()` is a custom utility or part of an API update.
3. Clarification from the developers or additional commit history context regarding the purpose of the change.

If you have further context or documentation about the `JsonObject` class or the libraries used, I can assist in resolving this conflict. For now, the original conflict markers are preserved in the code snippet above.
