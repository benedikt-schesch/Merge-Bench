I'll return the snippet with the conflict unresolved as the intent behind the changes on both sides of the merge needs more context to be fully understood. On the `HEAD` side, a field `canComment` is added, while on the branch side (`a17acec`), two fields with Facebook-specific annotations are introduced. Without additional information about the purpose of these fields and whether they are meant to coexist or replace each other, it's ambiguous how to resolve this conflict semantically.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax exactly as provided:

```java
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  private String order;

<<<<<<< HEAD
  @Getter
  @Setter
  private Boolean canComment;

=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  @Facebook("comment_order")
  private String openGraphCommentOrder;

  @Facebook("can_comment")
  private Boolean openGraphCanComment;

```
