Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict to provide a resolution. Following the snippet, I will explain the reasoning behind the resolution.

```java
     * @param handler  handler where to receive the information
     * @param len      Maximum length of metadata column
     * @param rb       ResourceBundle for I18N
     * @see Setter#asAnnotatedElement()
     */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    protected void printOption(PrintWriter out, OptionHandler handler, int len, ResourceBundle rb) {

    private void printOption(PrintWriter out, OptionHandler handler, int len, ResourceBundle rb, OptionHandlerFilter filter) {
>>>>>>> 1acff436c29ed9c0f9ce81ad845b3df7480dde83
    	// Hiding options without usage information
    	if (handler.option.usage() == null ||
            handler.option.usage().length() == 0 ||
            !filter.select(handler)) {
    		return;
```

### Analysis and Resolution Reasoning

#### Intent and Semantics Analysis
- **HEAD (Left Side):** The method signature is `protected void printOption(PrintWriter out, OptionHandler handler, int len, ResourceBundle rb)`. This version does not include the `OptionHandlerFilter` parameter and has a visibility of `protected`. The intent here appears to be maintaining a simpler method signature without a filter and allowing subclasses to override or access this method due to the `protected` modifier.
- **Incoming Change (Right Side, commit `1acff436`):** The method signature is `private void printOption(PrintWriter out, OptionHandler handler, int len, ResourceBundle rb, OptionHandlerFilter filter)`. This version introduces an additional parameter `OptionHandlerFilter filter` and changes the visibility to `private`. The intent here is to add filtering functionality to the `printOption` method (evident from the usage of `filter.select(handler)` in the condition below) and restrict access to this method by making it `private`.
- **Shared Context:** Both sides share the same logic for hiding options without usage information. The key difference is the presence of the `filter` parameter and its usage in the condition `!filter.select(handler)` on the incoming side.

#### Conflict Resolution
The primary difference lies in the method signature (addition of the `filter` parameter and visibility change). Semantically, the incoming change (right side) enhances the functionality of the method by introducing a filtering mechanism, which is already used in the logic below (`!filter.select(handler)`). Ignoring the `filter` parameter (as in HEAD) would break this logic, as the code references `filter`, which wouldn't exist in the HEAD version. Therefore, the intent of the incoming change to support filtering should be prioritized.

Regarding visibility (`protected` vs. `private`), the incoming change to `private` suggests an intent to restrict access to this method, possibly as part of encapsulation or refactoring. However, since the HEAD version is `protected`, it might be indicating that subclasses or other classes in the package rely on accessing or overriding this method. Without additional context on whether this method needs to be accessible, I will lean toward preserving the functionality (adding the `filter` parameter) while maintaining the `protected` visibility from HEAD to avoid unintended breaking changes in access.

#### Resolved Code Snippet
Here is the resolved version of the code snippet, incorporating the intent from both sides:

```java
     * @param handler  handler where to receive the information
     * @param len      Maximum length of metadata column
     * @param rb       ResourceBundle for I18N
     * @see Setter#asAnnotatedElement()
     */
    protected void printOption(PrintWriter out, OptionHandler handler, int len, ResourceBundle rb, OptionHandlerFilter filter) {
    	// Hiding options without usage information
    	if (handler.option.usage() == null ||
            handler.option.usage().length() == 0 ||
            !filter.select(handler)) {
    		return;
```

#### Justification
- **Functionality:** Adopted the `filter` parameter from the incoming change (right side) to support the filtering logic already present in the code.
- **Visibility:** Retained `protected` from HEAD (left side) to preserve potential access or override needs by subclasses or other classes in the package, avoiding potential breaking changes. If `private` is indeed required, further context or confirmation would be needed to adjust this.
- **Intent Preservation:** This resolution combines the enhancement of filtering functionality (incoming intent) with the accessibility intent from HEAD. This approach ensures the method works as expected with the filtering logic while not restricting access unnecessarily.

If there are concerns about the visibility or if the `private` modifier is critical to the design, I recommend revisiting this with additional context about the class structure and usage of this method.
