I'm returning the snippet with the merge conflict unresolved because the intent and semantics of the conflicting changes are ambiguous without additional context. The conflict involves the presence or absence of a method `addHeader` in one of the branches, and it's unclear whether this method should be included or excluded in the final code. Below is the original snippet with the conflict markers preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax as provided.

```java
  public MockLowLevelHttpRequest(String url) {
    this.url = url;
  }

  @Override
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
  public void addHeader(String name, String value) {
    headers.put(name, value);
  }

  @Override
>>>>>>> f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b
  public LowLevelHttpResponse execute() throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpResponse();
  }

  @Override
```
