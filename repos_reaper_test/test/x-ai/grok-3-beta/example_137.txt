I'll preserve the original code snippet exactly as provided, including the context and spacing, and then discuss the potential resolution based on semantic intent.

```java
    }

    public static PhysicalPlan buildPp(PigServer pigServer, String query)
    throws Exception {
        LogicalPlan lp = buildLp( pigServer, query );
<<<<<<< HEAD
        return ((HExecutionEngine)pigServer.getPigContext().getExecutionEngine()).compile(lp,
=======
        lp.optimize(pigServer.getPigContext());
        return ((MRExecutionEngine)pigServer.getPigContext().getExecutionEngine()).compile(lp, 
>>>>>>> d95d3beb3c320c98d0af2ce3bcd2f3b656bdc98d
                pigServer.getPigContext().getProperties());
    }

    public static LogicalPlan parse(String query, PigContext pc) throws FrontendException {
        Map<String, String> fileNameMap = new HashMap<String, String>();
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics:

1. **Conflict Overview**:
   - **HEAD (HExecutionEngine)**: This side directly compiles the logical plan (`lp`) using `HExecutionEngine` without any explicit optimization step before compilation.
   - **Other branch (MRExecutionEngine)**: This side introduces an explicit optimization step (`lp.optimize(pigServer.getPigContext())`) before compiling the logical plan using `MRExecutionEngine`.

2. **Semantic Intent**:
   - **HEAD**: The intent appears to focus on a straightforward compilation of the logical plan, possibly assuming that optimization is either handled elsewhere or not needed in this context. The use of `HExecutionEngine` suggests a specific execution engine implementation (likely Hadoop-based).
   - **Other branch**: The intent is to ensure the logical plan is optimized before compilation, which could improve performance or efficiency. The use of `MRExecutionEngine` (possibly MapReduce-based) indicates a different execution engine, and the additional optimization step suggests a deliberate effort to refine the plan before execution.
   - Both sides aim to produce a `PhysicalPlan` from a `LogicalPlan` but differ in their approach to preprocessing and the specific execution engine used.

3. **Ambiguity**:
   - It’s unclear whether the optimization step (`lp.optimize()`) is critical or optional. If optimization is necessary for correctness or performance in the context of `MRExecutionEngine`, omitting it (as in HEAD) could lead to suboptimal or incorrect results.
   - The difference in execution engines (`HExecutionEngine` vs. `MRExecutionEngine`) suggests a deeper architectural change or fork in the codebase, which might be intentional but isn’t explained in the snippet.
   - Without additional context about the codebase, project goals, or the role of optimization, it’s ambiguous whether one approach should take precedence or if a combined solution is needed.

4. **Resolution Decision**:
   Given the ambiguity in intent and the potential risk of omitting either the optimization step or the correct execution engine, I’m choosing not to resolve the conflict at this stage. The original conflict markers are preserved to allow for further input from the developers or additional context about the system’s architecture.

If you have further context (e.g., documentation, commit messages, or clarification on the role of optimization and execution engines), I can revisit the resolution. For now, the snippet is returned unchanged with the conflict markers intact.
