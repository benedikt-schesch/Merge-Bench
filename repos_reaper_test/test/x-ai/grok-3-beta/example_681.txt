Let me analyze the merge conflict and resolve it based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

### Analysis of the Conflict:
- **HEAD (Left side):** 
  - Uses the term "resource access permissions" to describe the missing user(s)/group(s).
  - Uses `String.join("\n\t", missingPrincipals)` to concatenate the list of missing principals with newlines and tabs for formatting.
  - The message indicates that functionality differs due to missing "permissions/ownerships."
- **83418dbbb7fe (Right side):**
  - Uses the term "grants" instead of "resource access permissions."
  - Uses a more structured approach to format the list of missing principals: `missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))`, which sorts the list before joining.
  - Adds an exclamation mark for emphasis in the functionality difference message ("not identical to the export you just imported!").
- **Intent:**
  - Both sides aim to log a warning message about missing users or groups during deployment that affect functionality.
  - The right side improves readability by sorting the list of principals and uses slightly different wording ("grants" vs. "permissions") for clarity or consistency.
  - The right side's emphasis (exclamation mark) suggests a stronger tone of urgency.

### Resolution Rationale:
- I'll adopt the right side's use of `stream().sorted()` for better readability of the list of principals, as sorting is a clear improvement.
- I'll use "grants" over "permissions" to align with the right side's terminology, assuming it might reflect updated or preferred wording in the codebase.
- I'll keep the exclamation mark for emphasis as it adds to the warning's impact without changing the core message.
- The rest of the structure and context will remain unchanged to preserve the original formatting and intent.

### Resolved Code Snippet:
```java
