Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as is with the original context and spacing. After the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the conflict and a resolution based on the semantic intent of both sides.

```java
import com.github.mobile.util.HtmlUtils;
import com.karumi.dexter.Dexter;
import com.karumi.dexter.listener.PermissionGrantedResponse;
import com.karumi.dexter.listener.single.EmptyPermissionListener;
import com.karumi.dexter.listener.single.PermissionListener;
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import com.linkedin.android.spyglass.mentions.MentionsEditable;
>>>>>>> f8f91f1d455f6842ca57b8294f6a263ff0cde1e4
import com.linkedin.android.spyglass.suggestions.SuggestionsResult;
import com.linkedin.android.spyglass.tokenization.QueryToken;
import com.linkedin.android.spyglass.tokenization.interfaces.QueryTokenReceiver;
import com.linkedin.android.spyglass.ui.RichEditorView;
import com.mikepenz.iconics.IconicsDrawable;
```

### Analysis of the Conflict
- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The HEAD side does not include any additional imports at the conflict point. This suggests that the codebase on this branch either does not require the `MentionsEditable` class from the `spyglass` library or this import was not added yet.
- **Incoming Change (Right Side, commit f8f91f1d...)**: The incoming change adds an import for `com.linkedin.android.spyglass.mentions.MentionsEditable`. Given the surrounding context, which already includes other imports from the `spyglass` library (e.g., `SuggestionsResult`, `QueryToken`, `QueryTokenReceiver`, `RichEditorView`), it is clear that this codebase is using the `spyglass` library for features like mentions or rich text editing. The addition of `MentionsEditable` aligns semantically with the purpose of the other imports, likely supporting functionality for handling editable mentions in a rich text editor.

### Semantic Intent
- The intent of the incoming change (right side) is to include the `MentionsEditable` class, which is consistent with the surrounding imports related to the `spyglass` library for rich text editing or mentions functionality.
- The HEAD side does not explicitly oppose this addition (it’s an empty change in the conflict), suggesting there’s no conflicting intent to remove or avoid this import.
- Therefore, the semantic intent is to include the additional import to support the functionality provided by the `spyglass` library.

### Resolution
Since the incoming change adds a relevant import consistent with the surrounding context and there is no opposing change on the HEAD side, I resolve the conflict by accepting the incoming change.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
import com.github.mobile.util.HtmlUtils;
import com.karumi.dexter.Dexter;
import com.karumi.dexter.listener.PermissionGrantedResponse;
import com.karumi.dexter.listener.single.EmptyPermissionListener;
import com.karumi.dexter.listener.single.PermissionListener;
import com.linkedin.android.spyglass.mentions.MentionsEditable;
import com.linkedin.android.spyglass.suggestions.SuggestionsResult;
import com.linkedin.android.spyglass.tokenization.QueryToken;
import com.linkedin.android.spyglass.tokenization.interfaces.QueryTokenReceiver;
import com.linkedin.android.spyglass.ui.RichEditorView;
import com.mikepenz.iconics.IconicsDrawable;
```

This resolution preserves the surrounding context and spacing while incorporating the necessary import for `MentionsEditable` to support the intended functionality.
