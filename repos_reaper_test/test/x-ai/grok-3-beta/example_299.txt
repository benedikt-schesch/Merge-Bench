I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent of the conflicting changes is ambiguous. The `HEAD` side includes an import for `Instantiator`, while the other side (`0b417b6a09b0560e1dbb221d37310d67f7f56fcb`) removes it without adding any directly related replacement in the provided snippet. Without further context about the purpose of this import or the broader changes in the codebase, it's unclear whether the import should be retained or removed.

Here is the unmodified snippet with the conflict preserved:
