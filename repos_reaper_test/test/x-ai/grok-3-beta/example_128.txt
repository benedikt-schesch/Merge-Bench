I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet as is, then explain my reasoning for the resolution. First, here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved, maintaining all spacing and context exactly as provided:

```java
	private Text notScannedText;
	private Button[] displayMethod;
	private Button showInfoCheckbox;
	private Button askConfirmationCheckbox;
	private Combo languageCombo;
<<<<<<< HEAD
	private String[] languages = { "system", "en", "hu", "lt", "es", "ku" };

	@Inject public PreferencesDialog(PingerRegistry pingerRegistry, Config globalConfig, ScannerConfig scannerConfig, GUIConfig guiConfig) {
=======
	private String[] languages = { "system", "en", "hu", "lt", "es", "ku", "tr" };
	
	public PreferencesDialog(PingerRegistry pingerRegistry, Config globalConfig, ScannerConfig scannerConfig, GUIConfig guiConfig, ConfigDetectorDialog configDetectorDialog) {
>>>>>>> 90b95dd53d88e33bb1dd393eab78bae4f6ab5b14
		this.pingerRegistry = pingerRegistry;
		this.globalConfig = globalConfig;
		this.scannerConfig = scannerConfig;
		this.guiConfig = guiConfig;
	}
```

### Analysis and Resolution Reasoning

**Intent and Semantics Analysis:**
1. **Languages Array Difference:**
   - On the `HEAD` side, the `languages` array contains `{ "system", "en", "hu", "lt", "es", "ku" }`.
   - On the `90b95dd` side, the `languages` array contains an additional language, `"tr"` (Turkish), making it `{ "system", "en", "hu", "lt", "es", "ku", "tr" }`.
   - **Intent**: The `90b95dd` side likely intends to add support for an additional language ("tr"). This seems to be an enhancement or update to include more language options. The `HEAD` side does not have this addition, so it's preserving the original list.
   - **Semantic Resolution**: Since adding a language is a non-breaking change and likely an intentional update, the resolved version should include `"tr"` in the array.

2. **Constructor Signature Difference:**
   - On the `HEAD` side, the constructor is annotated with `@Inject` and has four parameters: `PingerRegistry`, `Config`, `ScannerConfig`, and `GUIConfig`.
   - On the `90b95dd` side, the constructor has no `@Inject` annotation and includes an additional parameter: `ConfigDetectorDialog`.
   - **Intent**: The `HEAD` side appears to be using dependency injection (via `@Inject`), which might be part of a framework like Guice or Spring for managing dependencies. The `90b95dd` side seems to be manually handling dependencies or extending functionality by adding a new dependency (`ConfigDetectorDialog`), possibly for additional configuration or dialog-related behavior.
   - **Semantic Challenge**: The presence or absence of `@Inject` and the additional parameter suggest different architectural approaches or requirements. Without further context, it's unclear whether the `@Inject` annotation should be retained or if the additional parameter is critical to the new functionality.
   - **Ambiguity**: The intent behind removing `@Inject` (if intentional) and adding `ConfigDetectorDialog` is not fully clear. It could be a refactoring to move away from dependency injection, or it could be an oversight. Similarly, the `HEAD` side might be outdated if the project is moving toward manual dependency management.

**Resolution Decision:**
Given the ambiguity in the constructor signature change (specifically regarding `@Inject` and the additional parameter), I will resolve the conflict partially by merging the non-ambiguous change (the `languages` array) but retain the conflict markers for the constructor to highlight the need for further clarification or context from the developers. However, since the instruction is to provide a resolved version if possible, I will assume that the addition of the new parameter (`ConfigDetectorDialog`) is an intentional enhancement and that the removal of `@Inject` might be part of a deliberate change in dependency management. If this assumption is incorrect, the conflict markers would need to be revisited.

Here is the resolved snippet, incorporating the additional language and assuming the new constructor signature is the intended change, while preserving all spacing and context as is, with the conflict resolved:

```java
	private Text notScannedText;
	private Button[] displayMethod;
	private Button showInfoCheckbox;
	private Button askConfirmationCheckbox;
	private Combo languageCombo;
	private String[] languages = { "system", "en", "hu", "lt", "es", "ku", "tr" };
	
	public PreferencesDialog(PingerRegistry pingerRegistry, Config globalConfig, ScannerConfig scannerConfig, GUIConfig guiConfig, ConfigDetectorDialog configDetectorDialog) {
		this.pingerRegistry = pingerRegistry;
		this.globalConfig = globalConfig;
		this.scannerConfig = scannerConfig;
		this.guiConfig = guiConfig;
	}
```

**Note**: If the `@Inject` annotation or the dependency injection framework is critical to the project, or if there are concerns about the `ConfigDetectorDialog` parameter, this resolution should be reviewed by the team. Iâ€™ve made an assumption based on the apparent intent to extend functionality (adding a language and a parameter). If further context is available, I can adjust the resolution accordingly. I've also chosen not to include an additional field for `ConfigDetectorDialog` in the resolved code since it wasn't assigned in the constructor body on the `90b95dd` side, but this might need to be revisited if storage of the parameter is intended.
