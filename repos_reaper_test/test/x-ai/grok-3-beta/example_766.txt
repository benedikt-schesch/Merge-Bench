I'll return the provided snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent of the changes on both sides of the merge is not entirely clear without additional context about the purpose of the code and the specific modifications intended by each branch. The `HEAD` side includes assignments for `family` and `qualifiers`, while the other side has no code in the conflict area, which might indicate a deletion or an incomplete merge. Without further information on the desired behavior (e.g., whether ` family` and ` qualifiers` should be set as in ` HEAD` or if there was an intentional omission), I will preserve the snippet unchanged.

Here is the original snippet with the merge conflict preserved:

```java
    } else {
      // No specific qualifier to delete: delete the entire family.  Not that
      // if `family == null', we'll delete and setting this is harmless.
      this.qualifiers = DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER;
    }
<<<<<<< HEAD
    this.family = family;
    this.qualifiers = qualifiers == null ? DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER : qualifiers;
