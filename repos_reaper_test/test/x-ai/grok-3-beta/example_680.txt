**Analysis and Resolution Explanation:**

After analyzing the merge conflict, I have decided to return the snippet with the conflict unresolved due to ambiguous intent and semantic differences between the two versions. Here's my reasoning based on the differences between the `HEAD` and the incoming branch (`83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965`):

1. **Text Description Differences:**
   - `HEAD` uses the phrasing "resource access permissions or node ownership" and "missing permissions/ownerships."
   - The incoming branch (`83418dbbb7`) uses "grants or node ownership" and "missing grants/ownerships."
   - Semantically, "permissions" (HEAD) and "grants" (incoming) might refer to similar concepts, but they could also carry different implications depending on the system's terminology or context (e.g., "grants" might imply a specific type of permission or a different mechanism). Without additional context about the codebase or domain-specific terminology, it's unclear which term is more appropriate or if they are interchangeable.

2. **Tone and Punctuation:**
   - `HEAD` ends the second sentence with a period (".").
   - The incoming branch ends it with an exclamation mark ("!"), suggesting a stronger emphasis or urgency.
   - While this is a minor stylistic difference, it could reflect differing intents regarding how critical the warning is perceived to be.

3. **List Generation Logic:**
   - `HEAD` uses `String.join("</li><li>", missingPrincipals)` to create the list of missing principals.
   - The incoming branch uses `missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>"))`, which introduces sorting of the principals.
   - The semantic intent here diverges: the incoming branch likely aims to improve readability or consistency by sorting the list alphabetically, while `HEAD` does not prioritize sorting. This difference in functionality (sorted vs. unsorted) could be significant depending on user expectations or requirements, and without further context, it's unclear whether sorting is necessary or desired.

**Conclusion:**
Given these differences, the intent behind each change is not fully clear without additional context about the project's goals, user expectations, or terminology standards. Resolving this conflict would require making assumptions about which phrasing ("permissions" vs. "grants"), tone (period vs. exclamation), and functionality (sorted vs. unsorted list) is preferred. Therefore, I have chosen to return the snippet with the conflict markers intact, preserving the original code and context as provided. If further clarification is available (e.g., project guidelines or input from the developers), I can assist in resolving the conflict accordingly.
