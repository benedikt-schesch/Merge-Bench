I'll return the provided snippet exactly as is in markdown code syntax without modifying the context or spacing. Since the conflict appears to be trivial (empty changes on both sides of the merge with no conflicting code or intent), I will note that there doesn't seem to be any meaningful content to resolve in the conflicting area. However, as requested, I will preserve the original conflict markers and content.

```java
    }

    public void visitPackage(POPackage pkg) throws VisitorException{
        //do nothing
    }
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
    
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a
    public void visitPOForEach(POForEach nfe) throws VisitorException {
        List<PhysicalPlan> inpPlans = nfe.getInputPlans();
        for (PhysicalPlan plan : inpPlans) {
            pushWalker(mCurrentWalker.spawnChildWalker(plan));
            visit();
```

**Explanation of Intent and Semantics**:  
Upon reviewing the conflicting section, it appears that there are no actual code changes or conflicting logic in the area marked by the merge conflict markers. The `HEAD` side has an empty line or no content, and the other branch (`88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) also introduces no conflicting content. The rest of the code context around the conflict remains consistent and unaffected. As a result, the intent on both sides seems to be aligned with no evident changes or modifications in the conflicting section. Therefore, I have left the conflict markers intact as per the instruction to return the snippet unchanged if resolution is unclear or not needed. If further context or clarification is provided, I can assist in resolving it accordingly.
