Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given with the original spacing and context. I have analyzed the conflict in terms of intent and semantics. Since both sides of the merge conflict contain identical code, there is no actual conflict to resolve; the lines are the same on both the `HEAD` and the incoming branch (`5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a`). Therefore, I will return the snippet with the conflict markers removed and the identical line retained.

```java
        synchronized (options.cardSetIds) {
          cardSets = loadCardSets(session);
          blackDeck = loadBlackDeck(cardSets);
          whiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
        }
        metrics.gameStart(currentUniqueId, cardSets, options.blanksInDeck, options.playerLimit, options.scoreGoal, !StringUtils.isBlank(options.password));
        startNextRound();
        gameManager.broadcastGameListRefresh();
      }
      return started;
    } finally {

```

**Explanation of Resolution**:  
The merge conflict appears to be a result of a git merge artifact, as the content on both sides of the conflict (`HEAD` and the incoming branch) is identical. The line in question logs game start metrics with parameters related to the game configuration. Since there is no semantic difference or conflicting intent between the two sides, the line is retained as is, and the conflict markers are removed. If there had been a difference in the parameters or logic, a deeper analysis of the intent (e.g., whether a parameter was added or modified for a specific feature) would have been necessary. However, in this case, no such resolution is required.
