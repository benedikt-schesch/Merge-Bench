Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and spacing, formatted in markdown code syntax. I have not modified the context or resolved the conflict yet, as I will first analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

```java
          regions.add(mapper.toJavaObject(region, KeyedType.class));
        }
      }
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    @Facebook
    protected List<Integer> locales = new ArrayList<Integer>();

=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    public boolean addCity(KeyedType city) {
      if (geoLocations != null) {
        return geoLocations.addCity(city);
      }
      return cities.add(city);
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The HEAD side introduces a field `locales` which is a `List<Integer>` annotated with `@Facebook`. This suggests that the intent is to store locale information related to a user or entity, possibly for integration with Facebook-specific data or functionality.
- **a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe (Right Side)**: The right side of the merge conflict is empty, indicating that this field does not exist in this branch. The branch likely does not include the addition of the `locales` field or any Facebook-specific integration at this point.

Since the right side does not add or modify anything in this conflict area (it is effectively a "no change" or deletion of the `locales` field), the intent of the right side is likely to maintain the codebase without this field. However, the HEAD side clearly intends to introduce this new field for a specific purpose (likely related to Facebook integration).

### Resolution Rationale
Given that the HEAD side explicitly adds a new field with a clear purpose (Facebook integration), and the right side does not introduce conflicting logic or an alternative implementation in this specific area, the safest and most semantically aligning resolution is to retain the HEAD changes. This preserves the intent of adding the `locales` field while ensuring no loss of functionality from the other branch (since it does not modify this section).

### Resolved Code
Below is the resolved snippet with the conflict markers removed and the HEAD changes retained:

```java
          regions.add(mapper.toJavaObject(region, KeyedType.class));
        }
      }
    }

    @Facebook
    protected List<Integer> locales = new ArrayList<Integer>();

    public boolean addCity(KeyedType city) {
      if (geoLocations != null) {
        return geoLocations.addCity(city);
      }
      return cities.add(city);
```

If there are concerns or ambiguity about whether the `locales` field should be included (e.g., if the right side intentionally omitted it for a specific reason not visible in this snippet), please provide additional context or feedback, and I can revisit the resolution. For now, I have prioritized the explicit intent from the HEAD side.
