I'll analyze the merge conflict in terms of intent and semantics, but as requested, I will return the snippet with the conflict unchanged since the intent behind the removal or addition of the import statement `import org.jbake.template.model.TemplateModel;` is ambiguous without further context.

The conflict appears to be about whether to include the `TemplateModel` import. On the `HEAD` side, the import is present, indicating that the code likely uses or references `TemplateModel` in the associated logic. On the other side (commit `d68ddea`), the import is absent, which could imply that it was deemed unnecessary or was intentionally removed due to refactoring or changes in the code that no longer require this import.

Without additional context about the broader codebase or the purpose of the surrounding changes in each branch, it's unclear whether the import should be retained or omitted. Therefore, I will return the snippet as provided, preserving the conflict markers and original formatting.

import org.apache.commons.configuration.CompositeConfiguration;
