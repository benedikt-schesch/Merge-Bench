I'll analyze the merge conflict and explain the intent behind both sides, then provide the unresolved snippet as requested since the resolution might depend on the broader context of the project.

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict
- **HEAD (Current Branch)**: This side imports assertion methods from the `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions` class, specifically `assertThat` and `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown`. This suggests that the codebase is using AssertJ for assertions, which is a fluent assertion library often preferred for its readability and detailed failure messages. The intent here is likely to maintain a consistent, modern testing style using AssertJ.
- **a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe (Incoming Branch)**: This side imports all static methods from `org.junit.Assert` using a wildcard (`*`). This indicates the use of JUnit's built-in assertion methods (like `assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, etc.). The intent here is likely to stick with JUnit's standard assertions, which are widely used and familiar to many developers.

### Semantic Intent
- Both sides are focused on testing and assertions, but they differ in the choice of assertion library. The HEAD side prefers AssertJ, while the incoming branch relies on JUnit assertions.
- Resolving this conflict depends on the project's overall testing framework and style guidelines. If the project has standardized on AssertJ, the HEAD side should be favored. If JUnit assertions are the norm, the incoming branch's approach should be taken. Without additional context (e.g., the project's testing conventions or the rest of the file's content), it's ambiguous which to choose.

### Snippet with Conflict Preserved
As per the instructions, since the intent is not fully clear without additional context, I am returning the original snippet with the conflict unchanged.

```java
 * THE SOFTWARE.
 */
package com.restfb;

import static java.net.HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown;
=======
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

import com.restfb.exception.FacebookJsonMappingException;
import com.restfb.types.FacebookType;
import com.restfb.types.User;
```

### Additional Note
If you can provide more context about the project's testing framework or the content of the test methods in this file, I can suggest a specific resolution. For now, the conflict is preserved as is. If a decision must be made, I would lean towards HEAD (AssertJ) since it specifies exactly which methods are needed, which is a more explicit and maintainable practice compared to a wildcard import. However, this is speculative without further information.
