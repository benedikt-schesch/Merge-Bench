Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, presented in markdown code syntax exactly as given. After the snippet, I will provide an explanation of the semantic intent and my resolution approach. Since the intent seems clear, I will also suggest a resolved version of the conflicting section.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Preserved as Provided)
```java

  protected ByteAssert(Byte actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ByteAssert.class, description);
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected){
=======
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Analysis of Semantic Intent
The merge conflict in this snippet appears to be a minor formatting difference in the method declaration of `isEqualTo`. Let's break down the two sides:
- **HEAD**: `public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected){` (no space between `expected)` and `{`)
- **Incoming commit (61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7)**: `public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {` (includes a space between `expected)` and `{`)

**Semantic Intent**:
- Both sides are defining the same method `isEqualTo` with the same signature, functionality, and return type. The difference is purely cosmetic, related to code style (spacing).
- The intent of both changes is identical: to provide a method for asserting equality between the actual byte value and an expected byte value.

**Resolution Approach**:
- Since the difference is purely stylistic, the resolution can adopt either formatting style. However, to align with common Java coding conventions (like those in Google's Java Style Guide or typical IDE defaults), adding a space before the opening brace `{` is generally preferred for readability.
- I will resolve the conflict by adopting the style from the incoming commit (with the space).

### Resolved Snippet
Below is the full snippet with the conflict resolved, maintaining the original context and spacing outside the conflicting region.

```java

  protected ByteAssert(Byte actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ByteAssert.class, description);
  }

  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD

```

**Note**: The trailing conflict marker `<<<<<<< HEAD` at the end of the snippet appears to be incomplete or misplaced in the original input (possibly a copy-paste error). I have preserved it as is in both the original and resolved snippets to match the provided input. If this is unintended, it should be removed in the final code. If there is additional context or conflict below this marker, it was not provided and thus not addressed.
