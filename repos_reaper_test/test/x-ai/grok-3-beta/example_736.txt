I'll analyze the merge conflict and resolve it based on the intent and semantics of both sides. Here's the snippet with the conflict resolved, including the full context as provided, in markdown code syntax with original spacing preserved:

```java
        super(context, attrs);
        setAspectRatio(4.0 / 3.0);
    }

    public void setAspectRatio(double ratio) {
        if (ratio <= 0.0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }

        ratio = 1 / ratio;

        if (mAspectRatio != ratio) {
            mAspectRatio = ratio;
```

**Resolution Explanation**:  
Both sides of the merge conflict are semantically identical in their intent: they check if `ratio` is less than or equal to 0.0 and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if true. The difference is purely in formattingâ€”`HEAD` has the check and throw on a single line, while the other branch (`c923751...`) splits it across multiple lines with curly braces for better readability. I resolved the conflict by choosing the more readable format with curly braces and proper indentation, as it improves code clarity without altering the functionality. The rest of the code context remains unchanged.
