I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

```java
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.UUID;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

import org.jboss.netty.channel.Channel;
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import org.jboss.netty.channel.group.ChannelGroup;

>>>>>>> 77ca2cb827b0a0b10f18d609fa5fd707c62376f7
import org.spout.api.command.CommandSource;
import org.spout.api.command.CommandManager;
import org.spout.api.entity.Entity;
import org.spout.api.event.EventManager;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
```

**Analysis and Resolution**:  
Looking at the merge conflict, the difference is that the branch `77ca2cb827b0a0b10f18d609fa5fd707c62376f7` adds an additional import statement for `org.jboss.netty.channel.group.ChannelGroup`, which is not present in the `HEAD` version. The intent of the branch seems to be adding support or functionality related to `ChannelGroup`, which is likely necessary for grouping channels in a networked application (given the context of `org.jboss.netty.channel.Channel` already being imported). The `HEAD` version does not remove or conflict with anything; it simply does not include this additional import.

Semantically, there is no conflict in terms of functionality since adding an import does not interfere with existing code unless there are naming collisions (which are not apparent here). Therefore, the resolution should include the additional import to support the functionality intended by the branch.

**Resolved Code**:
```java
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.UUID;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

import org.jboss.netty.channel.Channel;
import org.jboss.netty.channel.group.ChannelGroup;
import org.spout.api.command.CommandSource;
import org.spout.api.command.CommandManager;
import org.spout.api.entity.Entity;
import org.spout.api.event.EventManager;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
```

This resolution preserves the existing imports and includes the additional import from the branch, ensuring that the code has access to all necessary classes for both sides of the merge.
