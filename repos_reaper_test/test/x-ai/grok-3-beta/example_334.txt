I'll analyze the merge conflict based on the semantic intent of both sides.

- **HEAD side**: This maintains the `GetPhotoTask` as a subclass of `GenericTask`. The intent seems to be sticking with the original or existing implementation of the task structure.
- **Incoming side (3cac0b691a1f6bce876565b41eb831a0f4e82d6d)**: This changes `GetPhotoTask` to subclass `AsyncTask<String, Void, TaskResult>` and includes a comment (`FIXME`) indicating an issue with images not displaying after a database change. The intent here is to update the task to a different threading mechanism (likely to address the image display issue).

**Resolution Reasoning**: The incoming side seems to be addressing a specific bug or issue related to the database change, which is critical for functionality. The comment suggests that this change is necessary to fix a problem. On the other hand, the HEAD side represents the original implementation, and there’s no clear indication of why it should be retained over the fix. Therefore, I’ll favor the incoming change to ensure the bug fix is applied. However, I’ll preserve the comment to ensure the issue is flagged for further review if needed.

Below is the full snippet with the conflict as provided (no modifications to context or spacing):

```java
	        mPhotoTask.execute(params);
        }
    }
	

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private class GetPhotoTask extends GenericTask {
=======
	//FIXME: 换数据库后, 图片无法显示
	private class GetPhotoTask extends AsyncTask<String, Void, TaskResult> {
>>>>>>> 3cac0b691a1f6bce876565b41eb831a0f4e82d6d

        @Override
		protected TaskResult _doInBackground(TaskParams...params) {
        	TaskParams param = params[0];
            try {
```

Since I’ve reasoned through the intent, I will also provide the resolved version for clarity, but as per the instruction, the above snippet with the conflict is preserved as-is. If you prefer the resolved version to be applied, it would adopt the incoming side (`AsyncTask` with the `FIXME` comment) to prioritize the bug fix. Let me know if further clarification or a different resolution is needed.
