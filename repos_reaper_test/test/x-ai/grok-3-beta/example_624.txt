I'll return the provided code snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent of the changes in the conflicting section is not entirely clear without additional context. The `HEAD` side includes a `serialVersionUID` field, which is often used for serialization purposes in Java classes. The other side (commit `a17acec...`) appears to have removed or not included this field, but without further information about why it was removed or whether it was intentional, it's ambiguous to resolve this conflict. My goal is to preserve the original content and spacing exactly as provided.

```java
    }
  }

  public static class Targeting extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
