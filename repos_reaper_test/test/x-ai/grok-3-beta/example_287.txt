I'll analyze this merge conflict by looking at the intent and semantics of both sides.

**Conflict Analysis:**
- **HEAD**: Does not introduce a new variable or assign anything to `keyWritable`. The focus is on other parts of the code, likely relying on `key` being set from `pkgr.getKey(k)` without additional assignments.
- **Branch (88ae4a5)**: Introduces an assignment to `keyWritable = k`, suggesting an intent to retain the original input key `k` as a writable object for potential further use or reference.

**Intent and Semantics:**
- The HEAD version seems to focus on maintaining the existing logic of extracting a `key` using `pkgr.getKey(k)`.
- The branch version (88ae4a5) appears to add a new requirement to keep track of the original input `k` in the form of `keyWritable`, possibly for serialization or other downstream processing. This indicates an enhancement or a specific feature implementation.
- Since there’s no indication that assigning `keyWritable` interferes with the HEAD logic (and assuming `keyWritable` is a declared field in the class), the intent seems to be additive rather than conflicting.

**Resolution:**
Since the branch’s change is an addition and does not conflict with the HEAD’s logic, I will include the assignment to `keyWritable` in the resolved code to preserve the new functionality while retaining the HEAD's behavior.

Here is the resolved code snippet with full context preserved as provided:

```java
     */
    public void attachInput(PigNullableWritable k, Iterator<NullableTuple> inp) {
        try {
            tupIter = inp;
            key = pkgr.getKey(k);
            keyWritable = k;
            inputAttached = true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "Error attaching input for key " + k +
                    " in " + name() + " at location " + getOriginalLocations(), e);
```
