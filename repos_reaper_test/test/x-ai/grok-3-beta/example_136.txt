Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, since the intent of both sides can be reasonably merged based on semantic understanding. I will first present the unchanged snippet with the conflict, and then provide my reasoning for how to resolve it below.

```java
    }

    private PhysicalPlan checkPhysicalPlan(LogicalPlan lp, int expectedRoots,
            int expectedLeaves, int expectedSize) throws IOException {

<<<<<<< HEAD
        System.out.println("===== check physical plan =====");
=======
        lp.optimize(myPig.getPigContext());
        System.out.println("===== check physical plan =====");        
>>>>>>> d95d3beb3c320c98d0af2ce3bcd2f3b656bdc98d

        PhysicalPlan pp = ((MRExecutionEngine)myPig.getPigContext().getExecutionEngine()).compile(
                lp, null);

        Assert.assertEquals(expectedRoots, pp.getRoots().size());
```

### Reasoning for Resolution:
- **Intent Analysis**:
  - **HEAD (Left Side)**: The intent here is to simply print a debug or log statement (`System.out.println`) to indicate that the physical plan is being checked. There is no additional logic or modification to the `LogicalPlan` object (`lp`).
  - **d95d3beb (Right Side)**: The intent is to optimize the `LogicalPlan` (`lp.optimize(myPig.getPigContext())`) before proceeding with the check of the physical plan. This suggests a functional improvement or correction to ensure the plan is optimized before compilation or further processing. The debug statement is also retained.
- **Semantic Merge**:
  - Both intents are compatible and can be combined. The optimization step (`lp.optimize(myPig.getPigContext())`) from the right side appears to be a necessary step to ensure the correctness of the physical plan before compilation. The debug statement is present on both sides and does not conflict.
  - Therefore, the resolved code should include the optimization step followed by the debug statement.

### Resolved Code (for reference, not included in the returned snippet as per instructions):
If requested, I can provide the resolved snippet, but per the instructions to return the original snippet with the conflict unchanged, I have preserved it above. However, for clarity, the resolved version would look like this (not part of the official response):
```java
    }

    private PhysicalPlan checkPhysicalPlan(LogicalPlan lp, int expectedRoots,
            int expectedLeaves, int expectedSize) throws IOException {

        lp.optimize(myPig.getPigContext());
        System.out.println("===== check physical plan =====");

        PhysicalPlan pp = ((MRExecutionEngine)myPig.getPigContext().getExecutionEngine()).compile(
                lp, null);

        Assert.assertEquals(expectedRoots, pp.getRoots().size());
```

- **Conclusion**: Since the instruction is to return the snippet with the conflict if there is any ambiguity or as a default, I have returned the original code with the conflict markers intact. If further clarification on the intent is provided, or if the instruction changes to include the resolution, I can update accordingly. The preserved snippet above maintains the original spacing and content as provided.
