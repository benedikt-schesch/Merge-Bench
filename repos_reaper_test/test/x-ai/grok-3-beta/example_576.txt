I'll return the snippet as provided, with the merge conflict unresolved, because the intent behind the two versions is ambiguous without additional context about the surrounding code and the specific use case. Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
      Class<? extends Enum> enumType = type.asSubclass(Enum.class);
      try {
        return Enum.valueOf(enumType, rawValue.asString());
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException iae) {
        if (MAPPER_LOGGER.isDebugEnabled()) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
          MAPPER_LOGGER.debug(format("Cannot map string %s to enum %s", rawValue.asString(), enumType.getName()));
=======
          MAPPER_LOGGER.debug(
            format("Cannot map string %s to enum %s", jsonObject.getString(facebookFieldName), enumType.getName()));
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
        }
      }
    }

    String rawValueAsString = jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue);
```

**Reasoning**:  
The conflict revolves around the source of the string value used in the debug log message. On the `HEAD` side, it uses `rawValue.asString()`, which appears to be directly tied to the input being processed in the `Enum.valueOf` call above. On the other side (`a17acec`), it uses `jsonObject.getString(facebookFieldName)`, suggesting a dependency on a specific field from a JSON object, which may indicate a more specialized context or a different data source. Without knowing whether `jsonObject` and `facebookFieldName` are defined in the broader scope, or if they accurately represent the intended input (as opposed to `rawValue`), I cannot confidently resolve this conflict. The intent of each side is unclear without additional context about the data flow and variable definitions.

If you can provide more context about the variables (`rawValue`, `jsonObject`, `facebookFieldName`) and the purpose of this code (e.g., general enum mapping vs. specific handling of Facebook-related data), I can attempt to resolve the conflict with greater accuracy. For now, I am preserving the conflict as is.
