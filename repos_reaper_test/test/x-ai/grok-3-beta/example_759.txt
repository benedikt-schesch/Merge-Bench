Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, along with my analysis of the intent and semantics behind both sides of the conflict. I will not modify the context or spacing, as requested.

```java
            });
        }
        mapReference.set(mapBuilder.createPersistedTo(mapFile));
        try (ExternalMapQueryContext<Integer, Integer, ?> c = mapReference.get().queryContext(KEY)) {
            c.writeLock().lock();
<<<<<<< HEAD
            Thread.sleep(30_000);
=======
            Thread.sleep(8_000);

        }
    }

    private static ChronicleMapBuilder<Integer, Integer> createMapBuilder() {
        return ChronicleMapBuilder
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **HEAD (Thread.sleep(30_000))**: The intent on this side appears to introduce a delay of 30 seconds (30,000 milliseconds). This could be for debugging purposes, simulating a long-running operation, or ensuring that some external condition has time to be met (e.g., waiting for a resource or another thread). The longer duration suggests a need for a significant wait time, possibly in a specific testing or development scenario.
  
- **Branch (Thread.sleep(8_000))**: The intent on this side is also to introduce a delay, but for a shorter duration of 8 seconds (8,000 milliseconds). This might reflect an optimization or a change in requirements where the wait time was reduced to improve performance or responsiveness. Alternatively, it could indicate a different testing or debugging need.

### Resolution Difficulty and Ambiguity

The intent behind the `Thread.sleep()` call is not entirely clear without additional context about the purpose of the delay. Both sides are semantically similar in that they are introducing a delay within a locked context (`writeLock().lock()`), likely to simulate or handle some timing-related behavior while ensuring exclusive access. However, the specific duration of the delay (30 seconds vs. 8 seconds) is crucial, and the correct choice depends on the intended behavior or requirement that is not evident from the snippet alone.

- If the delay is for testing or debugging, the duration might be arbitrary, and either value could work, or a compromise (e.g., an average) might be acceptable.
- If the delay is tied to a specific functional requirement (e.g., waiting for an external system), the correct value is critical, and choosing the wrong one could break the application.

Given the ambiguity, I am not resolving the conflict at this stage. The durations differ significantly, and without clarity on the purpose of the sleep or the broader context of the changes in each branch, itâ€™s unclear which value aligns with the intended behavior. A discussion with the developers involved in both changes or additional documentation about the purpose of the delay would be necessary to make an informed decision.

Thus, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact, as provided. If further context or clarification is available, I can revisit the resolution.
