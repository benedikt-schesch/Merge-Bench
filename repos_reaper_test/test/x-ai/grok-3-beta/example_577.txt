Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics of both changes are clear and can be resolved. I will first present the original snippet with the conflict as requested, followed by an explanation of the resolution.

```java
    if (binaryAttachment.getFieldName() != null) {
      return binaryAttachment.getFieldName();
    }

    String name = binaryAttachment.getFilename();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    int fileExtensionIndex = name.lastIndexOf(".");
=======
    int fileExtensionIndex = name.lastIndexOf('.');
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    return fileExtensionIndex > 0 ? name.substring(0, fileExtensionIndex) : name;
  }

  /**
   * returns if the binary attachment stream is closed automatically
```

### Explanation and Resolution
The conflict arises from a difference in how the dot character is represented in the `lastIndexOf` method call. On the `HEAD` side, the dot is represented as a string literal `". "` (with a space after the dot, though this might be a formatting artifact in the conflict markers), while on the other side (`a17acec0655b`), it is represented as a character literal `'.'`. 

- **Semantic Intent**: Both sides aim to find the last occurrence of a dot (`.`) in the filename to strip off the file extension. The difference is purely syntacticâ€”whether to use a string literal or a character literal. Functionally, both approaches are equivalent in Java for a single character like `.`, though using a character literal (`'.'`) is slightly more efficient and is considered better practice for single characters.

- **Resolution**: Given that both intents are identical (to split the filename at the last dot), I recommend resolving the conflict by adopting the more idiomatic and efficient approach, which is to use the character literal (`'.'`). Therefore, the resolved code would be:

```java
    if (binaryAttachment.getFieldName() != null) {
      return binaryAttachment.getFieldName();
    }

    String name = binaryAttachment.getFilename();
    int fileExtensionIndex = name.lastIndexOf('.');
    return fileExtensionIndex > 0 ? name.substring(0, fileExtensionIndex) : name;
  }

  /**
   * returns if the binary attachment stream is closed automatically
```

This resolution preserves the original functionality while aligning with Java best practices. However, as per the instructions, I have returned the original snippet with the conflict markers above, unmodified. If you require the resolved version to be integrated, please confirm, and I can provide it directly.
