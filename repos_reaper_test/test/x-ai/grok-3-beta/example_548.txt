        if (definition == null) {
```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Intent and Semantics:**
- **HEAD (Left Side):** The code snippet from the HEAD branch shows a call to `getDefinitionFromJaxrsSources` with three parameters: `defSource`, `useSectionNamingPackageStrategy`, and `applicationName`. However, it appears incomplete as it ends abruptly with a comma, suggesting that more parameters might have been intended or that this is a formatting artifact during the merge.
- **Other Branch (Right Side):** The code from the other branch (commit `1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f`) shows the same call to `getDefinitionFromJaxrsSources`, but with the parameters `defSource`, `useSectionNamingPackageStrategy`, and `applicationName`, followed by `endpoint` and `jaxRsResources` on the next line as part of the complete method call.
- **Semantic Intent:** The intent from both sides seems to be calling the `getDefinitionFromJaxrsSources` method. The difference lies in the number of parameters. The HEAD side appears to be either outdated or incomplete, while the other branch includes additional parameters (`endpoint` and `jaxRsResources`), which are likely necessary for the method's functionality based on the context (since `jaxRsResources` is checked in the conditional statement just before this call). It is reasonable to assume that the intent of the other branch is to pass all necessary data to construct the `definition` object properly.

**Resolution:**
Since the other branch includes a complete set of parameters that align with the context (checking `jaxRsResources` and likely using it in the method), I will resolve the conflict by adopting the version from commit `1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f`.

Here is the resolved code snippet with the full context preserved:

```java
                    LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "Class " + defSource
                            + " is not supported");
                    System.exit(1);
                }
            } else if (!jaxRsResources.isEmpty()) {
                definition = getDefinitionFromJaxrsSources(defSource, useSectionNamingPackageStrategy, applicationName,
                        endpoint, jaxRsResources);
            }
        }

        if (definition == null) {
```

This resolution ensures that the method call includes all necessary parameters, maintaining the semantic intent of constructing a `definition` object using JAX-RS resources and related data. If there is any ambiguity or concern about the HEAD branch's intent (e.g., if it was deliberately reducing parameters for a specific reason), further clarification from the developers involved in the changes would be needed. Based on the provided context, this resolution seems the most aligned with the apparent purpose.
