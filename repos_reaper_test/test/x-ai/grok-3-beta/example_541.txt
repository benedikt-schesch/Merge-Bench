I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. The conflict revolves around the string message for `logConnectFail`. Let's look at the intent and semantics of both sides:

- **HEAD**: Uses `"Connect failed"` which is concise and focuses on the action of connecting failing.
- **Branch (f53ac04b)**: Uses `"Connection failed"` which emphasizes the state of the connection rather than the action.

Semantically, both messages convey a similar meaning: the connection attempt did not succeed. However, looking at the surrounding context of other log messages (e.g., `"Device isn't connected"`, `"Never connected to device"`), the style leans towards describing states or outcomes rather than actions. Therefore, `"Connection failed"` aligns slightly better with the overall tone and intent of the other log messages.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved as provided:

```java
  private final String logAlreadyScanning = "Scanning already in progress";
  private final String logScanStartFail = "Scan failed to start";
  private final String logNotScanning = "Not scanning";
  //Connection
  private final String logPreviouslyConnected = "Device previously connected, reconnect or close for new device";
  private final String logConnectFail = "Connection failed";
  private final String logNeverConnected = "Never connected to device";
  private final String logIsNotConnected = "Device isn't connected";
  private final String logIsNotDisconnected = "Device isn't disconnected";
  private final String logIsDisconnected = "Device is disconnected";
  private final String logNoAddress = "No device address";
