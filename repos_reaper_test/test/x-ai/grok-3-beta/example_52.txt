Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including the full context and spacing. Following the snippet, I will explain my analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the conflict and provide a resolution.

```java
   *
   * @param player The player for whom to get status.
   * @return Information for {@code player}: Name, score, status.
   */
  public Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object> getPlayerInfo(final Player player) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    final Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object> playerInfo = new HashMap<GamePlayerInfo, Object>();
=======
    final Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object> playerInfo = new HashMap<>();

    // TODO make sure this can't happen in the first place
    if (player == null) {
      return playerInfo;
    }
    playerInfo.put(GamePlayerInfo.NAME, player.getUser().getNickname());
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

The merge conflict arises from two different ways of initializing a `HashMap` for storing player information. Let's break down the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The code uses `new HashMap<GamePlayerInfo, Object>();` which explicitly specifies the generic type parameters for the `HashMap`. This is likely from an older version of the codebase or from a developer who prefers explicit type declarations for clarity or consistency with older Java versions (pre-Java 7).
  
- **Branch (Right Side, commit `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a`)**: The code uses `new HashMap<>();` which leverages Java's diamond operator (introduced in Java 7) for type inference. This is a more modern and concise way of initializing generics, reducing boilerplate code while maintaining the same functionality. The intent here is likely to modernize the code or adhere to newer style guidelines.

**Semantic Intent**: Both sides aim to achieve the same functional outcomeâ€”creating a new `HashMap` with keys of type `GamePlayerInfo` and values of type `Object`. There is no difference in behavior or functionality between the two; the conflict is purely syntactic.

**Resolution Strategy**: Since the conflict is stylistic rather than functional, and the right side uses a more modern and widely accepted syntax (diamond operator), it makes sense to adopt the branch version (`new HashMap<>();`) for consistency with modern Java practices, unless the project's style guide explicitly requires full type declarations.

### Resolved Code Snippet

Below is the resolved code snippet with the conflict markers removed, adopting the branch version for its modern syntax:

```java
   *
   * @param player The player for whom to get status.
   * @return Information for {@code player}: Name, score, status.
   */
  public Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object> getPlayerInfo(final Player player) {
    final Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object> playerInfo = new HashMap<>();
    // TODO make sure this can't happen in the first place
    if (player == null) {
      return playerInfo;
    }
    playerInfo.put(GamePlayerInfo.NAME, player.getUser().getNickname());
```

This resolution preserves the original context and spacing while choosing the more concise and modern syntax. If there are specific project guidelines or constraints not visible in the snippet that mandate explicit type declarations, the HEAD version could be retained instead. However, based on the provided information, the branch version is the preferred resolution.
