No reasoning found</think>
I'm returning the snippet with the resolved merge conflict. My reasoning is based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge. The conflict revolves around the method declaration of `getString()` in the `Localizable` interface. On the `HEAD` side, the method is declared with the `public` access modifier, while on the other branch (`5adedd248`), the `public` modifier is omitted. Since methods in a Java interface are implicitly `public` by default (as per Java language specification), both declarations are semantically equivalent. The intent on both sides is clearly to define a method that returns a user-visible string associated with the enum value. Therefore, I will resolve the conflict by choosing the more explicit declaration with `public` for clarity, as it better communicates the access level to readers of the code, even though both are correct.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved exactly as provided:

```java
   */
  public interface Localizable {
    /**
     * @return The user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     */
    public String getString();
  }

  /**
   * Enums that implement this interface have two user-visible strings associated with them.
   * <p>
```
