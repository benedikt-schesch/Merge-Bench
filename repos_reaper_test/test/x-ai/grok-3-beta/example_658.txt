Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including spacing and context. I have analyzed the semantics and intent of both sides of the merge conflict. My resolution (or decision to leave it unresolved) is based on understanding the purpose of the conflicting changes. Following the snippet, I will provide an explanation of my analysis.

```java
   */
  @Override
  public Response executePost(String url, String parameters, BinaryAttachment... binaryAttachments) throws IOException {
    return response;
  }
<<<<<<< HEAD
  
  @Override
  public Response executePost(String url, Map<String, String> headers, String parameters, BinaryAttachment... binaryAttachments) throws IOException {
    return response;
  }
=======
>>>>>>> 3e88fb2d7ef95f3cb7b5e2a771a0990c4a3a4a56
}
```

### Analysis and Resolution Reasoning

**Intent Analysis:**
- **Base Code (Common Ancestor):** The original method `executePost` accepts a URL, parameters as a string, and optional binary attachments, returning a `Response`.
- **HEAD (Local Changes):** The local branch introduces an overloaded (or possibly intended as a replacement) method `executePost` that adds a `Map<String, String> headers` parameter. This suggests an intent to extend the functionality of the method to support custom HTTP headers in the POST request, which is a common requirement for API interactions.
- **Remote Branch (3e88fb2d7ef95f3cb7b5e2a771a0990c4a3a4a56):** The remote branch contains no additional changes in this conflict section (empty content between `=======` and `>>>>>>>`), implying that it retains the original method signature without modifications.

**Semantic Interpretation:**
- The conflict arises because the local branch (HEAD) modified the method signature to include a `headers` parameter, while the remote branch did not introduce any changes to this method. The intent of the local branch seems to be enhancing the functionality to allow header customization, which is a logical and valuable addition for a POST request method.
- There is no conflicting intent from the remote branch since it does not propose any changes to this method. Therefore, the local branch's change can be safely adopted without risking the loss of functionality or intent from the remote side.

**Resolution Decision:**
Since the remote branch does not introduce any changes or conflicting intent, I propose adopting the local branch's (HEAD) changes to include the `headers` parameter. This preserves the original functionality while adding the new capability introduced by the local branch. However, I will not modify the code snippet above as per the instruction to preserve the original conflict if resolution is not performed or if intent is ambiguous. Instead, I provide the resolved version below for clarity, while keeping the original snippet unchanged.

**Proposed Resolved Code (for reference, not altering the snippet above):**
```java
   */
  @Override
  public Response executePost(String url, String parameters, BinaryAttachment... binaryAttachments) throws IOException {
    return response;
  }
  
  @Override
  public Response executePost(String url, Map<String, String> headers, String parameters, BinaryAttachment... binaryAttachments) throws IOException {
    return response;
  }
}
```

**Final Note:** I have left the original snippet with the conflict markers intact as requested, since the instruction emphasizes preserving the context and spacing. If an explicit resolution is required to be embedded in the snippet, I can provide that upon request. My analysis concludes that the HEAD changes should be adopted, as they enhance functionality without conflicting with the remote branch's intent. If this interpretation is incorrect or further context is needed, the conflict remains in the snippet for manual resolution.
