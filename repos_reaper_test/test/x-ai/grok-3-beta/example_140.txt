Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as I will analyze the intent and semantics of both sides before proposing a resolution. The context and spacing are kept exactly as provided.

```java
                break;
            }
        }
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    @Private
    public PigContext getPigContext() {
        return pigContext;
    }

>>>>>>> f6a8f7aa42cae344f71cc6759f1c7880b49211fc
    public void start() {
        startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        userId = System.getProperty("user.name");
    }
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The HEAD side shows no additional code or changes in the conflict area, implying that this branch does not introduce or modify anything in this specific section of the file. The intent appears to be maintaining the status quo or not including the method `getPigContext()` at this point in the code.
- **Incoming Changes (Right Side, f6a8f7aa42cae344f71cc6759f1c7880b49211fc)**: The incoming branch adds a new method `getPigContext()` with the `@Private` annotation, which likely indicates restricted access to the `pigContext` field (used to return a context object in a Pig-related framework or application). The intent here is to expose the `pigContext` in a controlled manner, possibly for internal use or testing, given the `@Private` annotation.

### Resolution Reasoning

Given the analysis:
- There is no conflicting code on the HEAD side, just an absence of content, which suggests that the HEAD branch did not modify or add anything in this area.
- The incoming branch introduces a new getter method for `pigContext`, which does not interfere with other parts of the code (like the `start()` method that follows).
- The intent of the incoming branch is clear: to provide access to `pigContext` with restricted visibility.
- There are no semantic overlaps or contradictions since the HEAD side does not oppose or modify this addition.

Thus, the merge conflict can be resolved by accepting the incoming changes (the addition of the `getPigContext()` method) as they do not conflict with any explicit intent on the HEAD side.

### Resolved Code Snippet

```java
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    @Private
    public PigContext getPigContext() {
        return pigContext;
    }

    public void start() {
        startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        userId = System.getProperty("user.name");
    }
