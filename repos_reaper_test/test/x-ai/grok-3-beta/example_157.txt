**Explanation**: I have preserved the original code snippet with the merge conflict as provided, without making any modifications to the context or spacing. The conflict involves two different imports: `FileLocalizer` from the HEAD branch and `PigImplConstants` from the branch with commit ID `2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea`. 

In terms of semantic intent, it is unclear without additional context why each branch chose to import a different class. `FileLocalizer` is likely related to handling file operations or localization in Pig, while `PigImplConstants` might be used for accessing specific constants or configuration values critical to the implementation. Since the purpose and necessity of each import are ambiguous and the resolution would depend on the specific functionality or logic in the rest of the codebase (which is not provided), I am not attempting to resolve the conflict. Both imports could potentially be needed, or one might be more relevant depending on the changes in the broader codebase.

If further context or clarification about the intent of each branch is provided, I can assist in resolving the conflict by either including both imports or selecting the appropriate one based on the functionality being implemented. For now, I have left the conflict markers intact as per the instructions.
