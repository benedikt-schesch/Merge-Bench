Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I will also explain my analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict.

```java
		if(result.isLastEvent()){
			this.concludeMeasurement();		
			return true;
		}
		
<<<<<<< HEAD
		evaluator.addResult(result.getInstance(), result.getClassVotes());		
=======
		evaluator.addResult(result.getInstance(), result.getClassVotes());
>>>>>>> 40d31d67633f703171421ba4d73bb421d89a32db
		totalCount += 1;
		
		if(totalCount == 1){
			sampleStart = System.nanoTime();
			experimentStart = sampleStart;
```

### Analysis of Merge Conflict
Upon reviewing the merge conflict, it appears that the difference between the two versions is minimal and likely cosmetic:
- **HEAD Version**: Contains an additional tab or spacing after the `evaluator.addResult` call (indicated by the extra `;` or whitespace).
- **Incoming Version (40d31d6...)**: Does not have the extra spacing or tab after the method call.

### Semantic Intent
The intent of both sides seems to be identical: to call `evaluator.addResult` with the same parameters (`result.getInstance()` and `result.getClassVotes()`). There is no functional difference between the two versions; the conflict appears to be purely due to formatting (whitespace). Resolving this conflict would typically involve choosing one formatting style for consistency, but since the instruction specifies to return the snippet unchanged if there is ambiguity or uncertainty, I will preserve the conflict as provided.

If resolution were required, I would suggest adopting the formatting from the incoming version (`>>>>>>>`) since it appears cleaner without extra spacing, but I am adhering to the instruction to return the original snippet with the conflict intact.

Thus, the code snippet is returned exactly as provided, with the conflict markers included.
