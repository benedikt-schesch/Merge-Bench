**Explanation of Intent and Resolution Decision:**

After analyzing the provided merge conflict, I have decided to preserve the conflict as is due to ambiguity in intent. Here's my reasoning:

- **HEAD Side**: The HEAD side does not include any additional import statement in the conflicting section. It appears to maintain the original state of the code without introducing new dependencies or changes in this particular snippet.
- **Incoming Change (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe)**: This side introduces a static import for `CLIENT_LOGGER` from `com.restfb.logging.RestFBLogger`. This suggests an intent to add logging functionality or reference a logger specifically for client-related operations within the RestFB library.
- **Ambiguity in Intent**: Without further context about the broader changes in the codebase (e.g., whether logging is being introduced or refactored across the project), it is unclear whether this import is necessary or if it aligns with the overall design intent of the HEAD branch. Additionally, there is no information about whether this logger is used in subsequent parts of the code or if it was part of a larger feature addition.

**Decision**: Since the intent behind adding the `CLIENT_LOGGER` import cannot be confirmed without additional context, and to avoid introducing unnecessary or potentially incorrect dependencies, I am returning the snippet with the conflict unresolved. Further input from the developers or additional context about the purpose of the logger import would be required to make an informed resolution.
