Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as is, including spacing and context. I will also provide an analysis of the intent and semantics behind both sides of the merge conflict and propose a resolution.

```java
          if (!roundPlayers.contains(player)) {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
            break;
          }
          final List<WhiteCard> playerCards = playedCards.getCards(player);
<<<<<<< HEAD
          if (playerCards != null && blackCard != null
              && playerCards.size() == blackCard.getPick()) {
=======
          if (playerCards != null && blackCard != null && playerCards.size() == blackCard.getPick()) {
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
          } else {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.PLAYING;
          }
        }
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **Context**: The code appears to be part of a game logic implementation, likely for a card game (e.g., Cards Against Humanity, given the reference to `WhiteCard` and `BlackCard`). The logic determines the status of a player (`IDLE` or `PLAYING`) based on whether they have played the required number of cards (`blackCard.getPick()`) for the current round.
- **Conflict Details**: 
  - On the `HEAD` side, the condition for setting `playerStatus` to `GamePlayerStatus.IDLE` is written with an extra line break in the condition (`&& blackCard != null` is on a new line).
  - On the branch side (`5adedd2481...`), the condition is written more concisely, with all conditions on a single line.
  - **Semantic Intent**: Both sides are functionally identical. The difference is purely stylistic and relates to code formatting (line breaks). There is no change in logic or behavior between the two versions.
- **Resolution Strategy**: Since the logic is the same on both sides, the conflict can be resolved by choosing one formatting style. For consistency and readability, I will adopt the more concise version from the branch side (`5adedd2481...`), as it keeps the condition on a single line, which is often preferred for clarity in compact conditional statements.

### Resolved Code Snippet
Here is the resolved version of the code snippet with the conflict markers removed and the formatting from the branch side applied:

```java
          if (!roundPlayers.contains(player)) {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
            break;
          }
          final List<WhiteCard> playerCards = playedCards.getCards(player);
          if (playerCards != null && blackCard != null && playerCards.size() == blackCard.getPick()) {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
          } else {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.PLAYING;
          }
        }
```

### Explanation of Resolution
- I chose the formatting from the branch side (`5adedd2481...`) for its conciseness, placing the condition on a single line.
- The functionality remains unchanged, as both sides of the conflict had identical logic.
- If the team or project has a specific style guide regarding line breaks in conditions, that should take precedence, and the resolution can be adjusted accordingly (e.g., adopting the `HEAD` style with the condition split across lines). Since no such context was provided, I prioritized readability and compactness.

If there are any concerns or additional context about coding style preferences, I can adjust the resolution accordingly.
