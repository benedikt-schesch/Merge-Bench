I'll return the code snippet as provided, preserving the context and spacing, and then discuss the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict to propose a resolution.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the conflict:

```java
      setIllustrator(lr);
    }

    @Override
    public void visitPackage(POPackage pkg) throws VisitorException{
<<<<<<< HEAD
         if (!(pkg.getPkgr() instanceof LitePackager) && pkg.getPkgr().isDistinct())
             setIllustrator(pkg, 1);
         else
             setIllustrator(pkg, null);
=======
        setIllustrator(pkg, pkg.numberOfEquivalenceClasses());
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a
    }

    @Override
    public void visitPOForEach(POForEach nfe) throws VisitorException {
        if (revisit && nfe.getIllustrator() != null)
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **HEAD (Left Side)**:
  - The intent here seems to be setting an illustrator for a `POPackage` object with a specific value based on a condition. If the package's packager is not an instance of `LitePackager` and is distinct (via `isDistinct()`), it assigns a value of `1` to the illustrator. Otherwise, it assigns `null`.
  - Semantically, this suggests a binary decision: either set a minimal or default illustrator value (`1`) for distinct, non-LitePackager packages, or disable illustration altogether (`null`).

- **Commit 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a (Right Side)**:
  - The intent here is to set the illustrator based on a dynamic value: the number of equivalence classes for the package (`pkg.numberOfEquivalenceClasses()`).
  - Semantically, this suggests a more granular or detailed approach to illustration, where the illustrator value reflects some inherent property or count related to the package's structure (equivalence classes).

- **Common Intent**:
  - Both sides aim to set an illustrator for a `POPackage` object using the `setIllustrator` method. The difference lies in how they determine the value to be set.

- **Conflict Resolution Consideration**:
  - The HEAD version uses a conditional check to decide between `1` and `null`, focusing on package type and distinctiveness.
  - The right side directly uses a computed value (`numberOfEquivalenceClasses()`) which might align better with the actual structure or complexity of the package.
  - Combining both intents could mean respecting the conditional logic from HEAD while incorporating the dynamic computation from the right side, but this requires understanding whether `numberOfEquivalenceClasses()` could return a value equivalent to `null` or `1` under the same conditions as HEAD's logic.
  - Without further context on what `numberOfEquivalenceClasses()` represents or guarantees (e.g., can it return `0` or `null`? Does `1` mean the same as "distinct"?), a safe resolution cannot be definitively determined.

### Proposed Resolution (or Lack Thereof)

Since the intent behind `numberOfEquivalenceClasses()` and its relationship with `isDistinct()` or `LitePackager` isn't clear from the provided snippet, and without additional context about the expected behavior of `setIllustrator`, I will not resolve the conflict. Resolving this incorrectly could lead to logical errors (e.g., setting an unintended value for the illustrator).

I recommend that the developer or team responsible for this code reviews the intent:
- Does `numberOfEquivalenceClasses()` encapsulate the same logic as the HEAD condition, or is it a different metric?
- Should the conditional logic from HEAD be preserved, or is the right sideâ€™s approach more accurate for all cases?

Thus, I am returning the snippet with the conflict intact as requested when the resolution is ambiguous.

If further documentation or context is provided (e.g., what `numberOfEquivalenceClasses()` returns or represents), I can revisit this for a definitive resolution.
