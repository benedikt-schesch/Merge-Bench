Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including the context and spacing. I will also provide an analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict and suggest a resolution based on that analysis.

### Code Snippet with Merge Conflict (Unmodified)
```java
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookGraphException;
import com.restfb.exception.generator.DefaultFacebookExceptionGenerator;
import com.restfb.testutils.AssertJson;

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import org.json.JSONException;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
import org.junit.Test;

public class StatusExceptionTest extends AbstractJsonMapperTests {

  @Test
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD (Left Side):** The HEAD side does not include any additional import statement in the conflict area. This might suggest that the code in this branch either does not require the `org.json.JSONException` import or it was intentionally omitted. The intent could be to keep the imports minimal or rely on existing exception handling mechanisms without explicitly importing `JSONException`.
- **a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe (Right Side):** The right side introduces an additional import for `org.json.JSONException`. This indicates that the code in this branch likely handles or references `JSONException` explicitly, possibly for catching or throwing this specific exception in the `StatusExceptionTest` class or related functionality.

**Semantic Intent:** The `StatusExceptionTest` class appears to be a test class (given the `@Test` annotation and the inheritance from `AbstractJsonMapperTests`) related to exception handling in the RestFB library (a Java client for the Facebook Graph API). The import of `JSONException` on the right side suggests that the test or underlying code might deal with JSON parsing errors, which is plausible in the context of API interactions where JSON is the primary data format. The HEAD side's omission of this import might mean it either does not deal with JSON exceptions directly or relies on a different approach for error handling.

**Potential Ambiguity:** Without seeing the full content of the `StatusExceptionTest` class or the changes in the rest of the commit, it is not entirely clear whether `JSONException` is necessary. However, since test classes often need to handle specific exceptions to verify behavior, and given that RestFB deals with JSON data, it is more likely that the import is required for explicit exception handling in the test.

### Proposed Resolution
Based on the semantic analysis, I recommend resolving the conflict by including the import from the right side (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) since it is likely needed for the test's functionality. The resolved code snippet would be:

```java
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookGraphException;
import com.restfb.exception.generator.DefaultFacebookExceptionGenerator;
import com.restfb.testutils.AssertJson;

import org.json.JSONException;
import org.junit.Test;

public class StatusExceptionTest extends AbstractJsonMapperTests {

  @Test
```

**Rationale:** Including the `JSONException` import aligns with the probable intent of handling JSON-related errors in the test class, which is consistent with the domain of the RestFB library. If the import turns out to be unnecessary (e.g., due to unused code), it can be removed later via an IDE's import optimization or during code review. However, omitting it now risks compilation errors if the test code references `JSONException`.

If you have additional context or the full class definition, I can refine this resolution further. For now, this resolution prioritizes including the import to support the likely intent of the test class.
