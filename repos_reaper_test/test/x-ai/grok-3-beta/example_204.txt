I'm returning the provided code snippet with the merge conflict resolved. The intent of both sides of the merge seems clear: the `HEAD` side does not include a return description in the Javadoc, while the `1488b22` side adds a description of the return value for better documentation. Semantically, including the return value description improves clarity and aligns with good documentation practices. Therefore, I will adopt the change from the `1488b22` branch to include the `@return` tag in the Javadoc comment.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved as provided:

```java
    }

    /**
     * Returns the length of a file in bytes which exists in the HDFS (accounts for replication).
     * @param filename
     * @return length of the file in bytes
     * @throws IOException
     */
    public long fileSize(String filename) throws IOException {
        DataStorage dfs = pigContext.getDfs();
        ElementDescriptor elem = dfs.asElement(filename);
```

**Explanation of Resolution**: 
The merge conflict is in the Javadoc comment for the `fileSize` method. The `HEAD` version does not include a description of the return value, while the `1488b22` version adds `@return length of the file in bytes`. Since adding the return description enhances the documentation without altering the method's behavior or intent, I resolved the conflict by incorporating the `@return` line from the `1488b22` branch. The rest of the context and spacing remain unchanged as per the original snippet.
