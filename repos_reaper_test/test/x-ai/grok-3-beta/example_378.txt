I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet with the resolved code based on the semantic intent of both sides.

/**
 * HTTP Media-type as specified in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-3.7">HTTP RFC</a>.
 *
 * <p>Implementation is not thread-safe.

```

**Explanation of Resolution:**
- **Intent Analysis**: Both sides of the conflict are attempting to document the HTTP Media-type with a reference to the relevant RFC section. The difference lies in the formatting and the URL used for the hyperlink.
  - `HEAD` uses a simpler format with a direct link to `tools.ietf.org` and plain text description.
  - The other branch (`2ed19b71ea730095e23224b02a1aa0791ed10dab`) uses a more specific URL from `datatracker.ietf.org` and includes additional formatting for clarity (`HTTP RFC` as the link text).
- **Semantic Resolution**: I resolved the conflict by adopting the version from the branch `2ed19b71ea...` because it provides a more precise URL and better formatting with the link text explicitly stating "HTTP RFC," which improves readability and clarity for the documentation. This seems to be an improvement over the `HEAD` version while maintaining the same intent of referencing the HTTP specification.
- **Preservation**: The rest of the context (imports, surrounding comments, spacing) is preserved exactly as provided.
