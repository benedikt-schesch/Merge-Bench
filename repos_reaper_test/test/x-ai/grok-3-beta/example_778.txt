Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics behind the changes are ambiguous without additional context. I will also explain my reasoning for not resolving the conflict.

```java
  public GetRequest maxVersions(final int versions) {
    if (versions <= 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Need a strictly positive number: "
                                         + versions);
    }
<<<<<<< HEAD
    this.versions = versions;
=======
    this.versions = (versions << 1) | (this.versions & EXIST_FLAG);
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    return this;
  }

  /**
   * Returns the maximum number of versions to return for each cell scanned.
```

### Reasoning:
- **Left Side (HEAD):** The code simply assigns the input `versions` to the instance variable `this.versions`. The intent appears to be straightforward: store the number of versions as provided by the user.
- **Right Side (d543609...):** The code performs a bitwise operation `(versions << 1) | (this.versions & EXIST_FLAG)`, which suggests a more complex intent, such as encoding additional information (possibly a flag like `EXIST_FLAG`) into the `versions` field. This could be for optimization, state tracking, or some other purpose specific to the implementation.
- **Ambiguity:** Without further context about the purpose of `EXIST_FLAG`, the structure of `this.versions`, or the broader system design, it is unclear whether the right side's bitwise manipulation is necessary or if it introduces unintended behavior compared to the simpler assignment on the left side. Additionally, it is uncertain whether the left side's simplicity is intentional (e.g., a refactoring or bug fix) or if it overlooks a critical detail addressed by the right side.
- **Conclusion:** Due to the ambiguity in intent and the potential impact of choosing one approach over the other, I have preserved the conflict markers and returned the snippet unchanged. Resolving this would require additional information about the codebase, such as the definition and purpose of `EXIST_FLAG`, the expected behavior of `maxVersions`, or documentation/comments explaining the bitwise operation. If such context is available, I can assist in resolving the conflict accordingly.
