I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent and semantics of the conflicting changes are ambiguous without additional context about the data models (`WorkExperience` vs. `Work`) and their intended use.

Here is the unchanged snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java

  @Facebook
  private List<UserDevice> devices = new ArrayList<UserDevice>();

  @Facebook
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private List<WorkExperience> work = new ArrayList<WorkExperience>();
=======
  private List<Work> work = new ArrayList<Work>();
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  @Facebook
  private List<Education> education = new ArrayList<Education>();

  @Facebook

```

**Explanation**: The conflict involves a difference in the type used for the `work` list (`WorkExperience` vs. `Work`). Without further information about the application's domain model, naming conventions, or the purpose of these types, it's unclear which type is the correct or intended one. It could be a rename, a different abstraction, or an intentional divergence. If additional context or clarification about the intent of these types is provided, I can assist in resolving the conflict. For now, I preserve the original conflict markers and code as is.
