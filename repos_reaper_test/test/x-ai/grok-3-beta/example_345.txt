I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet with the unresolved conflict as the intent from both sides is not entirely clear without additional context. Below is the original snippet preserved exactly as provided, including spacing and formatting.

```java
	 *            Offset (0 for none)
	 * @param limit
	 *            Limit (0 for none)
	 * @return
	 */
<<<<<<< HEAD
	public ArrayList<FileLocation> getDirectory(INotifiableManager manager,
			String path, DirectoryMask mask, int offset, int limit,
			final int mMediaType, Sort sort) {
=======
	public ArrayList<FileLocation> getDirectory(INotifiableManager manager, String path, DirectoryMask mask, int offset, int limit,  final int mMediaType) {
		throw new RuntimeException("Obsolete, remove any calls from this.");
		/*
>>>>>>> fe1b8ab28f6b9e6d70825a39c04c0384351cd5a8
		final ArrayList<FileLocation> dirs = new ArrayList<FileLocation>();
		final JsonNode jsonDirs = mConnection.getJson(
				manager,
				"Files.GetDirectory",
				sort(obj().p("media", "files").p("directory", path),
```

**Analysis of the Conflict:**

- **HEAD Side Intent**: This side includes a `Sort` parameter in the method signature, suggesting an intent to add sorting functionality to the `getDirectory` method. The implementation appears to be incomplete or cut off in the snippet, but the goal seems to be enhancing the method's capabilities.
- **fe1b8ab28f6b9e6d70825a39c04c0384351cd5a8 Side Intent**: This side removes the `Sort` parameter and adds a `RuntimeException` with a message indicating the method is obsolete and should no longer be used. The intent here is to deprecate or remove the method's usage.

**Reason for Not Resolving**: The conflict presents two opposing intentsâ€”one to enhance the functionality with sorting and the other to mark the method as obsolete. Without further context about the project's direction (e.g., whether the method should indeed be deprecated or if the sorting feature is a critical update), it's ambiguous how to resolve this conflict. Resolving it would require understanding the broader codebase or team decisions regarding deprecation vs. enhancement. Hence, I'm returning the snippet unchanged with the conflict markers intact for further clarification from stakeholders.
