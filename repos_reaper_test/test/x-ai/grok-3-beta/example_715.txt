Let's analyze the intent and semantics of the merge conflict in the provided code snippet, and then provide the snippet as is in markdown code syntax.

### Analysis of Merge Conflict

**Context**: The code appears to be part of a media player implementation where the `seekTo` method is used to move to a specific time in the media playback.

- **HEAD Version**:
  ```java
  MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
  if (sMediaPlayer != null)
      sMediaPlayer.seekTo((int)msec);
  ```
  This version retrieves a `MediaPlayer` instance from a collection (`mMediaPlayers`) based on a prepared query (`mPreparedQuery`). It checks if the player exists before calling `seekTo`.

- **Incoming Change (ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66)**:
  ```java
  if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
      sMediaPlayer.seekTo((int) msec);
  }
  ```
  This version directly uses a variable `sMediaPlayer` (presumably defined elsewhere in the codebase) without fetching it from a collection. It also checks if the player exists before calling `seekTo`.

**Intent and Semantics**:
- Both versions aim to perform a seek operation on a `MediaPlayer` instance to a specified time (`msec`).
- The key difference is in how `sMediaPlayer` is obtained or referenced. 
  - The `HEAD` version suggests a context where multiple media players are managed in a collection, and the appropriate one is selected based on `mPreparedQuery`.
  - The incoming change implies `sMediaPlayer` is a pre-defined instance, likely a single player or already assigned elsewhere.
- Without additional context about the surrounding code (e.g., how `sMediaPlayer` is defined or whether `mMediaPlayers` and `mPreparedQuery` are still relevant), the intent remains ambiguous. Resolving this requires understanding the broader structure of the codebase, such as whether the application now uses a single `MediaPlayer` or still requires a collection-based approach.

**Conclusion**: Since the intent is ambiguous without further context (e.g., the definition of `sMediaPlayer` or the design of the media player management), I will not attempt to resolve the conflict and will return the snippet as is.

### Code Snippet with Conflict (Unresolved)

```java

    }

    @Override
    public void seekTo(long msec) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null)
            sMediaPlayer.seekTo((int)msec);
=======
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            sMediaPlayer.seekTo((int) msec);
        }
>>>>>>> ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66
    }

    @Override
    public void tryPrepareNext(final Query query) {
        TomahawkRunnable r = new TomahawkRunnable(1) {
```

If additional context or clarification about the intended design (e.g., single vs. multiple media players) is provided, I can assist in resolving the conflict accordingly.
