Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge. In this case, the conflict appears to be a minor formatting difference (an extra line break in the `HEAD` version) with no substantial semantic difference in the code logic or intent. Both versions define the same method signature for `broadcastToPlayers` with identical parameters and functionality. Therefore, I will resolve the conflict by selecting the more concise formatting from the `5adedd24` branch (without the extra line break) for clarity and consistency, but I will include the entire snippet with the conflict markers as requested before providing the resolution.

### Original Snippet with Conflict Preserved

```java
   *
   * @param type       Type of message to broadcast. This determines the order the messages are returned by
   *                   priority.
   * @param masterData Message data to broadcast.
   */
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public void broadcastToPlayers(final MessageType type,
                                 final HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> masterData) {
=======
  public void broadcastToPlayers(final MessageType type, final HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> masterData) {
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
    connectedUsers.broadcastToList(playersToUsers(), type, masterData);
  }

  /**
   * Sends updated player information about a specific player to all players in the game.
```

### Resolution Explanation

- **Intent and Semantics**: Both sides of the merge conflict define the same method `broadcastToPlayers` with identical parameters (`MessageType type` and `HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> masterData`) and the same method body. The only difference is in the formatting of the method signature: the `HEAD` version splits the parameters over two lines with indentation, while the `5adedd24` version keeps them on a single line. There is no functional or semantic difference between the two versions; it's purely stylistic.
- **Resolution Choice**: For the resolved version, I will adopt the formatting from the `5adedd24` branch (single line for the method signature) as it is more concise and aligns with common Java coding styles for method signatures unless they are excessively long. This choice maintains readability and consistency.
