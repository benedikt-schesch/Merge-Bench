Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including the full context and spacing. I have analyzed the semantics and intent of both sides of the merge conflict. My resolution (or decision to retain the conflict) follows the snippet.

```java
        return new DefaultResourceLoader();
    }

    private ResourceServlet concreteResourceServlet(final String location) {
        return new ResourceServlet() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            private static final long serialVersionUID = 4602656496188884537L;
=======
>>>>>>> b26c4f8ba13ab0d64627d01dcbba50609ff04a4f
			{
                setApplyLastModified(true);
                setContentType("image/png");
            }
```

### Analysis and Resolution:
- **Intent of HEAD**: The `HEAD` side includes a `serialVersionUID` field, which is typically used in Java for serialization purposes. This suggests that the intent is to ensure proper versioning of the serialized form of this anonymous `ResourceServlet` class, which might be necessary if this class is being serialized (e.g., in a distributed system or during persistence).
- **Intent of the other branch (b26c4f8)**: The other branch has removed or does not include the `serialVersionUID`. This could imply that serialization is not a concern in this branch, or it might be an oversight. The removal might be intentional if serialization is not needed or if the class is not intended to be serialized.
- **Semantic Merge Resolution**: Since the inclusion of `serialVersionUID` does not interfere with the functionality of the code on the other branch and is a good practice for anonymous classes that might be serialized, it is safer to retain the `serialVersionUID` from the `HEAD` branch. Removing it could potentially break serialization compatibility if it is needed. If serialization is explicitly not required, this would need to be clarified by the developers or through additional context (e.g., project guidelines or comments).

Given this reasoning, I will resolve the conflict by retaining the `serialVersionUID` from the `HEAD` branch. Below is the resolved code snippet with the conflict markers removed:

```java
        return new DefaultResourceLoader();
    }

    private ResourceServlet concreteResourceServlet(final String location) {
        return new ResourceServlet() {
            private static final long serialVersionUID = 4602656496188884537L;
			{
                setApplyLastModified(true);
                setContentType("image/png");
            }
```

If there is a specific reason to avoid serialization or if project guidelines dictate otherwise, this resolution can be revisited. However, based on the provided snippet and standard Java practices, retaining the `serialVersionUID` aligns with the cautious and semantic approach to ensure compatibility.
