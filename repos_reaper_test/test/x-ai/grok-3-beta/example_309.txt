I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent behind the changes in the conflicting lines is ambiguous. The `HEAD` side includes a `return str;` statement, which suggests an intent to return a string value at the end of the method. However, the other side (commit `b807edeecf20796a588b8510ceb86d80f0cad699`) appears to remove or omit this return statement, and without additional context about the method's purpose or the expected return type, it's unclear which change aligns with the intended semantics.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the merge conflict preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax:

```java
            if (reader != null) {
                reader.close();
                setStreamConsumed(true);
            }
        }
<<<<<<< HEAD
        return str;
=======
>>>>>>> b807edeecf20796a588b8510ceb86d80f0cad699
    }

    public JSONObject asJSONObject() throws ResponseException {
        try {
            return new JSONObject(asString());
```

If you can provide additional context about the method's return type or the purpose of the code, I can help resolve the conflict with a clearer understanding of the intended behavior.
