I'll analyze the intent and semantics of the merge conflict and provide the snippet with the conflict as is, since my role is to preserve the original context and spacing unless a clear resolution is determined.

```java
            throw new RuntimeException(sb.toString(), e);
        }
        return ret;
    }
    
<<<<<<< HEAD
    public static Object instantiateFuncFromSpec(String funcSpec) {
        return instantiateFunc(getClassNameFromSpec(funcSpec), getArgStringFromSpec(funcSpec));
=======
    public static Object instantiateFuncFromSpec(String funcSpec)  {
        return instantiateFuncFromSpec(new FuncSpec(funcSpec));
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }
    
    
    public Class getClassForAlias(String alias) throws IOException{
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

**Analysis of Intent and Semantics:**

- **HEAD (Left Side):** The `instantiateFuncFromSpec` method extracts the class name and arguments from the `funcSpec` string using utility methods (`getClassNameFromSpec` and `getArgStringFromSpec`) and then calls `instantiateFunc` with these parameters. The intent seems to be a direct parsing and instantiation approach, relying on manual extraction of components from the specification string.
  
- **Branch 1488b22 (Right Side):** The same method `instantiateFuncFromSpec` creates a `FuncSpec` object from the `funcSpec` string and passes it to another overload of `instantiateFuncFromSpec`. The intent appears to be a more structured or encapsulated approach, possibly delegating the parsing and instantiation logic to a dedicated class or method that handles `FuncSpec` objects.

Given the ambiguity in intent (whether to use direct parsing or a structured `FuncSpec` approach) and without additional context about the codebase (e.g., whether `FuncSpec` is a newer abstraction or if the direct parsing is preferred for specific reasons), I am unable to resolve the conflict definitively. The resolution would depend on the broader design decisions in the project, such as whether the codebase is moving toward using `FuncSpec` or maintaining the existing parsing logic.

As per the instruction, the snippet is returned unchanged with the conflict markers intact for further manual resolution or additional context.
