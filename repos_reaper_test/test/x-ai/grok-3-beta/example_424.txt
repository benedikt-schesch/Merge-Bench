Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics of the conflicting changes are ambiguous without further context. I have included the full context as provided, maintaining the original spacing and formatting in markdown code syntax.

```java
package org.jbake.app;

import org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;
import org.hamcrest.BaseMatcher;
import org.hamcrest.Description;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes;
import org.jbake.util.DataFileUtil;
=======
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.jbake.model.ModelAttributes;
>>>>>>> 1b5691ad2a7d734321d0382e71743a85835556b3
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.BeforeClass;
import org.junit.Test;
```

### Explanation of Decision:
I have chosen not to resolve the conflict because the intent behind the differing imports in the two branches is unclear from the provided snippet. Here's a breakdown of the conflict:

- **HEAD (Left Side)**: Imports `DocumentTypes` and `DataFileUtil`. This suggests the code in this branch might be working with document type definitions or utilities for handling data files.
- **Other Branch (Right Side)**: Imports `DocumentModel` and `ModelAttributes`. This implies the code may be focusing on a model structure for documents and associated attributes.

Without additional context about the purpose of the file or the surrounding code (e.g., how these imports are used in the test class or other parts of the project), itâ€™s not possible to determine which imports are necessary or if both sets should be included. The semantics of the intended functionality remain ambiguous, as the imports could relate to different features or refactoring efforts.

If further information is provided (e.g., the content of the test methods or the overall goal of the class), I can reassess and propose a resolution. For now, the snippet is returned unchanged with the conflict markers intact.
