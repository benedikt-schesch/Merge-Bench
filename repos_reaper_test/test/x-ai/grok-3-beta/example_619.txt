I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent of the changes is ambiguous without additional context. The conflict involves the presence or absence of a `serialVersionUID` field, and it's unclear whether it should be retained or removed based on the provided snippet alone.

Here is the unchanged code snippet with the surrounding context in markdown code syntax:

```java
   *
   * Represents the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/post#fields">Feed Targeting API type</a>.
   */
  public static class FeedTargeting extends Targeting {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
