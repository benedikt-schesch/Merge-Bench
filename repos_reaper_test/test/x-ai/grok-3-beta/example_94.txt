I'll analyze the merge conflict and resolve it based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

Looking at the conflict:

- **HEAD** version has 12 parameters for the `Game` constructor.
- **Incoming change** (ed08e371) has 13 parameters, adding an extra `falseProvider` and `gameOptionsProvider` at the end.

The intent of the code is to create a new `Game` instance with ID 1 for testing purposes, likely to simulate game recreation. The HEAD version seems to be an older version of the constructor call, while the incoming change includes additional parameters that were likely added as part of a feature or update to the `Game` class constructor (possibly for additional configuration or provider dependencies).

Since the incoming change appears to be an update to the constructor signature to include more providers, and this is a test context where specific configuration might be needed, I'll resolve the conflict by adopting the incoming change with the additional parameters.

Here is the resolved snippet with full context preserved as provided:

```java
    // remove game 1 using its own method -- this should be how it always happens in production
    gameManager.destroyGame(1);
    // make sure it re-uses that id
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
    gameManager.getGames().put(1,
        new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));
    assertEquals(-1, gameManager.get().intValue());

    // remove game 1 out from under it, to make sure it'll fix itself
    gameManager.getGames().remove(1);
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
```

### Resolution Rationale
- The additional parameters (`falseProvider` and `gameOptionsProvider`) in the incoming change suggest an evolution of the `Game` class constructor to support more dependency injection or configuration options.
- In a test context, it's safer to include all parameters as defined in the updated constructor to avoid runtime errors or behavioral inconsistencies.
- Thereâ€™s no explicit comment or context suggesting that the HEAD version's omission of parameters was intentional for this specific test case; hence, adopting the updated signature aligns with the likely intent of maintaining compatibility with the latest codebase.
