I'll analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict.

- **Left Side (HEAD)**: The code simply accesses `Spout.getPluginManager().getMetaPlugin()` to assign a value to `this.plugin`. The intent appears to be straightforwardâ€”retrieving a plugin instance using the plugin manager's method.
- **Right Side (67bcb76a96f...)**: The code casts `Spout.getPluginManager()` to `PluginManager` before calling `getMetaPlugin()`. The intent here might be to ensure type safety or to adapt to a change in the API where `getPluginManager()` returns a more generic type that needs to be explicitly cast to `PluginManager` to access `getMetaPlugin()`.

Given the semantic analysis, the right side's intent seems to handle a potential API change or enforce type safety through an explicit cast. However, without more context about the API or the codebase (e.g., whether `Spout.getPluginManager()` already returns a `PluginManager` or if the cast is necessary due to a change in return type), it's ambiguous whether the cast is actually required. If the cast is unnecessary (i.e., `getPluginManager()` already returns a `PluginManager`), the left side (HEAD) is cleaner and sufficient. If the cast is required due to an API change, the right side is correct.

Since the intent is ambiguous without additional context about the `Spout` API, I will return the snippet unchanged with the conflict markers intact, as per the instructions.

```java
	private DateFormat dateFormat;
	private List<Widget> lines = new ArrayList<Widget>();
	private float scroll = 0;

	public DevConsole(Font font) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.plugin = Spout.getPluginManager().getMetaPlugin();
=======
		this.plugin = ((PluginManager) Spout.getPluginManager()).getMetaPlugin();
>>>>>>> 67bcb76a96f358fc131320b0611ffaa3bf3678c2
		this.font = font;
		init();
	}
	
	public void clearConsole() {
