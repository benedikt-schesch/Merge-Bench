Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent behind the changes is ambiguous without additional context. I will also explain my reasoning for not resolving the conflict.

```java
            "short", "integer", "long");

    private static final List<String> decimalTypes = Arrays.asList("float",
            "double");

<<<<<<< HEAD
    public static String convertSampleAccordingToMediaType(
            Map<String, Object> content, String mediaTypeAsString,
            String representationName) {
=======
    public static String convertSampleAccordingToMediaType(Object content,
            String mediaTypeAsString, String representationName) {
>>>>>>> 4e8f0414b4f5ea733fcc30dd19944fd1e104bf74
        MetadataService ms = new MetadataService();
        MediaType mediaType = MediaType.valueOf(mediaTypeAsString);
        if (!supportedExtensions.contains(ms.getExtension(mediaType))) {
            return null;
        }
```

### Reasoning:
- **Conflict Analysis**: The conflict arises in the method signature of `convertSampleAccordingToMediaType`. On the `HEAD` side, the first parameter is defined as `Map<String, Object> content`, implying that the method expects a map as input. On the `4e8f0414b4f5ea733fcc30dd19944fd1e104bf74` side, the parameter is `Object content`, suggesting a more generic input type.
- **Intent Ambiguity**: Without additional context about the method's implementation or usage, it is unclear which type is more appropriate. The `HEAD` version might be enforcing a stricter type for clarity or correctness, while the other version might be aiming for flexibility or compatibility with a wider range of inputs. Furthermore, changing the type could affect how the method processes the `content` parameter downstream, and the rest of the method body is not provided to analyze this impact.
- **Risk of Incorrect Resolution**: Resolving this conflict by choosing one over the other could break the code if the method's internal logic or calling code relies on a specific type. For instance, if the method body (not shown here) assumes `content` is a `Map` and uses map-specific operations, choosing `Object` would lead to runtime errors or require additional type casting.
- **Conclusion**: Due to the ambiguity in intent and potential downstream impacts, I have chosen to preserve the conflict as is. A developer familiar with the codebase or additional context (such as the method's implementation or calling code) would be better equipped to resolve this conflict accurately. If further context is provided, I can revisit this resolution.
