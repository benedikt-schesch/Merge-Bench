Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I will also explain my analysis of the intent and semantics behind both sides of the merge conflict to propose a resolution.

```java
      return new InvalidResponseException(e.getMessage(), e);
    }
  }

  /**
<<<<<<< HEAD
   * De-serializes an exception.
=======
   * De-serializes an exception from HBase 0.94 and before.
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
   * @param buf The buffer to read from.
   * @param request The RPC that caused this exception.
   */
  static HBaseException deserializeException(final ChannelBuffer buf,
                                             final HBaseRpc request) {
```

### Analysis and Resolution Reasoning

- **HEAD (Current Branch Intent):** The comment `* De-serializes an exception.` is a generic description of the method's purpose. It indicates that the method is responsible for de-serializing an exception but lacks specificity regarding the context or version of HBase. The intent seems to keep the documentation simple and general, possibly to avoid tying it to a specific version or implementation detail.
  
- **Incoming Change (d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f Intent):** The comment `* De-serializes an exception from HBase 0.94 and before.` adds specificity by mentioning that the method handles exceptions from HBase versions 0.94 and earlier. The intent here appears to be providing clearer documentation for users or developers who might need to know the version compatibility or context of this method.

- **Semantic Merge Intent:** Both sides are describing the purpose of the method, but the incoming change provides additional context about version specificity, which could be valuable for clarity and maintainability. The HEAD version, while concise, might be too vague for scenarios where version-specific behavior is critical to understanding the code. There is no technical conflict in functionalityâ€”only in documentation detail.

- **Proposed Resolution:** I recommend adopting the more detailed description from the incoming change (`De-serializes an exception from HBase 0.94 and before.`) as it enhances clarity without altering the method's behavior or purpose. This aligns with the semantic goal of improving documentation for better understanding, especially in a context where HBase version compatibility might matter.

### Resolved Code Snippet

Below is the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict addressed by adopting the incoming change's documentation for its added specificity:

```java
      return new InvalidResponseException(e.getMessage(), e);
    }
  }

  /**
   * De-serializes an exception from HBase 0.94 and before.
   * @param buf The buffer to read from.
   * @param request The RPC that caused this exception.
   */
  static HBaseException deserializeException(final ChannelBuffer buf,
                                             final HBaseRpc request) {
```

If there is any uncertainty or if stakeholders prefer the more generic description, the original HEAD comment can be retained instead. However, based on the semantic intent of providing clear and precise documentation, the resolved version above is my recommended approach.
