I'll first present the code snippet with the conflict unchanged, as requested, and then analyze the intent and propose a resolution.

### Unmodified Code Snippet with Conflict
```java
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public void onAttached() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		// TODO Get FOV
		projection = Matrix4.createPerspective(fieldOfView, 4.0f / 3.0f, .001f, 1000f);
=======
		// TODO: Get FOV
		this.projection = MatrixMath.createPerspective(fieldOfView, 4.0f / 3.0f, .001f, 1000f);
>>>>>>> cc0703054530b4eeda07a2b1b619ed34e1e7d201
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public Matrix4 getProjection() {
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
Let's break down the intent of both sides of the merge conflict:

- **HEAD Side**:
  - Uses `Matrix4.createPerspective` to initialize a perspective projection matrix.
  - Assigns the result directly to the `projection` variable without using `this`.
  - Includes a comment `// TODO Get FOV`, indicating that the `fieldOfView` value might need to be dynamically determined or adjusted.

- **Incoming Change (cc070305...)**:
  - Uses `MatrixMath.createPerspective` to initialize a perspective projection matrix.
  - Assigns the result to `this.projection`, explicitly referencing the instance variable.
  - Also includes a similar comment `// TODO: Get FOV`, indicating the same unfinished task regarding the field of view.

**Semantic Intent**:
- Both sides aim to create a perspective projection matrix with identical parameters (`fieldOfView`, aspect ratio of `4.0f / 3.0f`, near plane of `0.001f`, and far plane of `1000f`).
- The primary difference is in the utility class or method used to create the matrix (`Matrix4` vs. `MatrixMath`) and the style of assignment (`projection` vs. `this.projection`).
- The use of `this.projection` suggests a possible intent to disambiguate the variable scope (e.g., if thereâ€™s a local variable or parameter with the same name), while the HEAD side assumes no such ambiguity.
- The method name difference (`Matrix4` vs. `MatrixMath`) likely reflects a refactoring or library change in one of the branches, indicating a potential update or migration in naming conventions or structure.

**Potential Ambiguity**:
- It is unclear which utility method (`Matrix4.createPerspective` or `MatrixMath.createPerspective`) is the correct or intended one to use. This could depend on the broader codebase context, such as whether `MatrixMath` is a newer or more appropriate utility class, or if `Matrix4` is deprecated.
- Without additional context about the codebase (e.g., class hierarchies, library versions, or refactoring history), it's difficult to definitively resolve which method to use.

### Proposed Resolution
Given that the intent of both sides is to create a perspective projection matrix with the same parameters, I will propose a resolution by favoring a consistent style and a likely updated naming if `MatrixMath` represents a newer convention. However, since the correct method is ambiguous without further context, I will also preserve the comment to indicate that the field of view still needs resolution.

I'll choose `MatrixMath.createPerspective` (from the incoming change) as it might reflect an updated or refactored utility class name, and I'll adopt `this.projection` for explicitness in scope. This balances the intent of both sides while maintaining clarity.

### Resolved Code Snippet
```java
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public void onAttached() {
		// TODO: Get FOV
		this.projection = MatrixMath.createPerspective(fieldOfView, 4.0f / 3.0f, .001f, 1000f);
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public Matrix4 getProjection() {
```

### Final Note
If you have additional context about whether `Matrix4` or `MatrixMath` is the correct or preferred utility class (e.g., based on codebase standards or deprecation status), please let me know, and I can adjust the resolution accordingly. For now, I've resolved the conflict by favoring the incoming change's naming and style for consistency. If this resolution is incorrect, I can revert to the original conflict snippet or adjust based on feedback.
