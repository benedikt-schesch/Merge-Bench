I'll analyze this merge conflict semantically. Based on the surrounding context, it appears that the code is part of a test checking properties of a `Comments` object associated with a rating. The conflict is about a line of code that checks if the user can comment.

Looking at the intent:
- On the `HEAD` side, there is a test assertion `assertTrue(comments.getCanComment());` which verifies that commenting is allowed.
- On the other branch side (a17acec), this line is removed or missing, which might imply that the test for `canComment` was intentionally removed or not added.

Since the surrounding context includes similar assertions for permissions like `canLike` on the `Likes` object, it seems logical that the intent on the `HEAD` side was to ensure a complete test coverage for permissions. The removal on the other side might be accidental or due to incomplete implementation. Given that, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the assertion from `HEAD` to maintain consistency in testing permissions.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved exactly as provided:

```java

    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getComments());
    Comments comments = exampleRating.getComments();
    assertEquals("chronological", comments.getOrder());
    assertEquals(1L, comments.getTotalCount().longValue());
    assertTrue(comments.getCanComment());

    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getLikes());
    Likes likes = exampleRating.getLikes();
    assertEquals(0L, likes.getTotalCount().longValue());
    assertTrue(likes.getCanLike());

```
