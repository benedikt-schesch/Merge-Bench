Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I have followed the instruction to return the snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context. After presenting the snippet, I will explain my reasoning regarding the merge conflict resolution (or lack thereof) based on the intent and semantics.

```java
        if (in != null)
        {
            parser = new GruntParser(in);
            parser.setParams(pig);    
        }
<<<<<<< HEAD
    }

    public void run() {
    parser.setInteractive(true);
    parser.parseContOnError();
=======
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }

    public void setConsoleReader(ConsoleReader c)
    {
        parser.setConsoleReader(c);
```

### Reasoning on Merge Conflict Resolution

Upon analyzing the merge conflict, I observe the following:

- **HEAD Branch (Left Side):** This side includes a `run()` method with specific logic to set the parser to interactive mode (`parser.setInteractive(true)`) and to continue parsing on error (`parser.parseContOnError()`). This suggests an intent to define behavior for executing or running the parser with specific configurations.
- **Incoming Branch (Right Side):** This side (commit `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) appears to be empty or has removed the `run()` method content or the method itself. Without additional context or code from the incoming branch, it is unclear whether the intent was to delete the `run()` method, redefine it elsewhere, or leave it as a stub.

### Semantic Intent Analysis

- The HEAD branch clearly intends to implement functionality within the `run()` method to control the parser's behavior.
- The incoming branch's intent is ambiguous due to the lack of content or context. It is not evident whether the removal of the `run()` method is deliberate (e.g., to obsolete the method or move its functionality elsewhere) or an oversight.
- Without further context about the overall changes in the incoming branch (e.g., whether `run()` is redefined elsewhere or if its functionality is no longer needed), it is not safe to assume the correct resolution.

### Decision

Given the ambiguity in the intent of the incoming branch and the lack of additional context to clarify whether the `run()` method should be retained, modified, or removed, I am returning the snippet with the conflict unresolved as per the instructions. Resolving this conflict would require more information about the broader changes in the incoming branch or explicit guidance on the desired behavior of the `run()` method.

If additional context or clarification is provided regarding the intent of the incoming branch (e.g., whether the `run()` method was intentionally removed or moved), I can revisit the resolution. For now, the original conflict markers and code are preserved as provided.
