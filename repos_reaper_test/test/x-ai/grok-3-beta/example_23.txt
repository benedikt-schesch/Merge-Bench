I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent behind the conflicting changes is ambiguous. The conflict involves the inclusion or exclusion of an import statement for `PluginManager`. It is unclear whether the intent on the `HEAD` side was to deliberately remove this import (perhaps due to it being unused or redundant) or if it was an oversight. Conversely, the intent on the other side (`67bcb76a96f358fc131320b0611ffaa3bf3678c2`) to include it might be due to a need for `PluginManager` in the codebase. Without further context about the usage of `PluginManager` or the purpose of the changes in either branch, I cannot confidently resolve the conflict based on semantics or intent.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, formatted exactly as provided:
