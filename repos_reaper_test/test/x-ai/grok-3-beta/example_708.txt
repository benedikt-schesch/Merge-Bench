Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict. However, the intent of the `HEAD` side is not visible in the snippet (as it appears empty or omitted), making it ambiguous to determine the intended behavior on that side. The other side (commit `5e4c2091dc2827219ba601937e8686bcb90bae78`) introduces logic to fetch and parse a JSON string into playlists. Without clarity on the `HEAD` side's intent, I cannot confidently resolve the conflict. Therefore, I am returning the snippet unchanged.

```java
			return null;
		} catch (NullPointerException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
			throw new JSONException(e.getLocalizedMessage());
		}
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

		String jsonString = doGet("id+name+url+duration/playlist/json/playlist_user/?order=starred_desc&user_idstr="+user);
		return PlaylistFunctions.getPlaylists(new JSONArray(jsonString));
>>>>>>> 5e4c2091dc2827219ba601937e8686bcb90bae78
	}

	@Override
	public Playlist getPlaylist(PlaylistRemote playlistRemote) throws JSONException, WSError {
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

**Explanation of Analysis:**  
- **HEAD Side:** The content of the `HEAD` side is not visible in the provided snippet (it appears empty or missing). Without this context, I cannot infer the intended behavior or logic that was meant to be in place.
- **Commit `5e4c2091dc2827219ba601937e8686bcb90bae78` Side:** This side introduces specific functionality to retrieve a JSON string via a `doGet` call with a constructed URL and then parse it into a list of playlists using `PlaylistFunctions.getPlaylists`. The intent seems to be fetching user-specific playlist data ordered by a "starred descending" criterion.
- **Conflict Resolution Decision:** Since the `HEAD` side's content or intent is unclear, I cannot make an informed decision on how to merge the two sides. Resolving this conflict would require additional context about the `HEAD` branch's changes or the overall purpose of the surrounding method. If the `HEAD` side was intentionally left empty, it might imply a removal of functionality, but without confirmation, I refrain from making assumptions.

If additional context or clarification about the `HEAD` side's intent is provided, I can revisit this conflict for resolution. For now, the snippet is returned as is with the conflict markers intact.
