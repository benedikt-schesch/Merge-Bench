Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as it was given, including spacing and context. I will then analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the conflict to propose a resolution.

```java

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_html() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.html", attachmentData.getBytes());
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html");
=======
    assertEquals("text/html", att.getContentType());
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_fallback() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";

```

### Analysis and Resolution

#### Intent and Semantics:
- **HEAD (Left Side)**: Uses `assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html")`, which suggests the use of a more modern assertion style, likely from a library like AssertJ. This style is fluent and often provides more readable error messages and flexibility in assertions. The intent appears to be using a matcher-based approach for content type verification.
- **Right Side (Commit `a17acec`)**: Uses `assertEquals("text/html", att.getContentType())`, which is a traditional JUnit assertion style. The intent here is to directly compare the content type string returned by `getContentType()` with the expected value.

#### Key Difference:
The primary difference lies in the assertion style and possibly the underlying testing framework or library being used. The HEAD side uses a matcher-based assertion (`hasContentType`), which might be tied to a specific API or library, while the right side uses a direct equality check (`assertEquals`), which is more generic but less expressive.

#### Proposed Resolution:
Since both sides are aiming to verify that the content type of the `BinaryAttachment` is `"text/html"`, the resolution should prioritize the style that aligns with the project's conventions or the more modern approach if no clear convention is evident.

- If the project is using AssertJ or similar libraries for fluent assertions, the HEAD side (`assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html")`) should be preferred for consistency and readability.
- If the project sticks to traditional JUnit assertions, the right side (`assertEquals`) would be more appropriate.

Given that the HEAD side likely represents the current working state or newer changes, and considering that fluent assertions like AssertJ are increasingly common for better test readability, I propose resolving the conflict in favor of the HEAD side. However, I will also note that if `hasContentType` is not a standard matcher or if it’s a custom implementation not guaranteed to be present, this could cause issues.

Additionally, the right side uses `getContentType()`, which may imply a direct getter method on `BinaryAttachment`. If `hasContentType` internally uses something other than `getContentType()`, there could be a semantic difference beyond just style. Without further context on the `BinaryAttachment` class or the testing framework, I’ll assume `hasContentType` is a valid matcher for the content type.

#### Resolved Code:
Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict markers removed, adopting the HEAD side for the reasons stated:

```java

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_html() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.html", attachmentData.getBytes());
    assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html");
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_fallback() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";

```

#### Note:
If there is uncertainty about whether `assertThat` and `hasContentType` are supported in the project (e.g., missing AssertJ dependency or custom matcher), or if the project strictly uses traditional JUnit assertions, the right side (`assertEquals`) should be chosen instead. If further context about the project’s testing style or the `BinaryAttachment` class is provided, I can revisit this resolution. For now, I’ve prioritized the HEAD side for its modern assertion style.
