Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent behind the conflicting changes is not entirely clear without additional context. I will also provide an analysis of the potential intents and why the conflict remains unresolved.

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "illustrate b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

<<<<<<< HEAD
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));
=======
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
>>>>>>> 2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            myPig.getPigContext().getProperties().setProperty("pig.usenewlogicalplan", "true");
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **HEAD (Left Side):** The code uses `GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));` which suggests the parser is initialized with only a `StringReader` for the script. This might imply a simpler or more isolated parsing context, or it could be an older version of the code before additional dependencies or configurations were introduced.
  
- **Branch 2125666c (Right Side):** The code uses `GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);` which includes an additional parameter `myPig`. This likely indicates that the parser needs to be aware of a specific `Pig` instance or context (`myPig`) to function correctly, possibly for configuration, state, or runtime information tied to the Pig environment.

### Reasoning for Not Resolving the Conflict

While it seems plausible that the right side (including `myPig`) might be the intended change to provide necessary context to the `GruntParser`, there are ambiguities:
1. Without further context about the codebase or the role of `myPig`, it's unclear if omitting it (as in HEAD) was intentional or an oversight.
2. The `myPig` instance is used later in the snippet (`myPig.getPigContext()`), which suggests it is available and relevant, but itâ€™s not definitive proof that it *must* be passed to the `GruntParser` constructor.
3. There could be side effects or dependencies on whether `myPig` is passed to the parser, which are not evident from this snippet alone.

Given these uncertainties, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact. If additional context about the purpose of `myPig` or the expected behavior of `GruntParser` is provided, I can offer a definitive resolution. For now, a safe assumption would lean toward the right side (including `myPig`), but I refrain from making that change without certainty.

If you can provide more details (e.g., documentation for `GruntParser`, the role of `myPig`, or surrounding changes in the merge), I will be happy to revisit this conflict for resolution.
