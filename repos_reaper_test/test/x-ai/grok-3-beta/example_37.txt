I'll return the provided snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent of the two conflicting changes is ambiguous without additional context about the purpose of the code and the specific usage of the imports. 

```java
import io.airlift.command.command.CommandRemove;

import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import static io.airlift.command.Cli.buildCli;
=======
import static io.airlift.command.SingleCommand.singleCommand;
>>>>>>> a647950590fa8dec1925101321699283f22a8bff

@Test
public class HelpTest
{
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Explanation:
- **Conflict Analysis**: The conflict involves two different static imports from the `io.airlift.command` package. On the `HEAD` side, the import is `Cli.buildCli`, while on the other branch (`a647950`), the import is `SingleCommand.singleCommand`. These seem to represent different approaches or utilities for command-line interface creation or command handling.
- **Intent Ambiguity**: Without further context about the purpose of the `HelpTest` class or the specific functionality being tested, it is unclear whether the intent is to use a CLI builder (`buildCli`) or a single command utility (`singleCommand`). Both could be valid depending on the overall design or testing goal.
- **Resolution Decision**: Since the intent cannot be confidently determined with the given snippet, I am preserving the conflict markers and returning the code unchanged. If more context (e.g., the rest of the `HelpTest` class or commit messages) were provided, I could infer whether one import is more appropriate or if both are needed.

If you can provide additional code or context, I'd be happy to assist in resolving this conflict.
