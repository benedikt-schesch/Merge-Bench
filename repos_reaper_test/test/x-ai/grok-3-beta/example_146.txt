I'm returning the provided code snippet with the merge conflict resolved. After analyzing the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge, it appears that the difference is minimal and centers around the access modifier of the `empty` field. The `HEAD` version uses `protected`, while the other branch uses `private`. Given the context of the class and the lack of additional information in the snippet, I'll resolve this by aligning with the more restrictive access level (`private`) to maintain encapsulation unless there's a clear need for broader access, which isn't evident here.

```java

 */
public class POStore extends PhysicalOperator {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private static Result empty = new Result(POStatus.STATUS_NULL, null);
    transient private StoreFuncInterface storer;
    transient private POStoreImpl impl;
    transient private String counterName = null;
    private FileSpec sFile;
    private Schema schema;
