I'll return the snippet with the resolved merge conflict based on the intent and semantics of both sides. The goal appears to be ensuring proper handling of specific input stream types (like `CBZip2InputStream`) while maintaining the buffering mechanism for other streams, as introduced in the changes from commit `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`. The original `HEAD` simply assigns the input stream without any conditional logic or buffering.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown syntax, preserving the original context and spacing, with the conflict resolved:

```java
    long pos;
    InputStream in;
    final int bufSize = 1024;
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in, long pos) {
        // Don't buffer a bzip stream as it will cause problems for split
        // records.
        if (in instanceof CBZip2InputStream) this.in = in;
        else this.in = new BufferedInputStream(in, bufSize);
        this.pos = pos;
    }
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in){
        this(in,0);
```

### Explanation of Resolution:
- **Intent of HEAD**: The original code directly assigns the `InputStream` to `this.in` without any additional processing or buffering. This is simple but does not handle specific cases where buffering might cause issues.
- **Intent of Commit `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`**: This change introduces conditional logic to avoid buffering for `CBZip2InputStream` (likely due to issues with split records as noted in the comment) while applying buffering with a specified `bufSize` for other streams.
- **Resolution**: The intent of the commit is to improve the handling of specific input stream types while maintaining buffering for others. Since there is no conflicting logic in `HEAD` (just a simpler assignment), adopting the logic from the commit makes sense as it adds a necessary enhancement without breaking the original functionality. Thus, the resolved code incorporates the conditional check and buffering logic from the commit.
