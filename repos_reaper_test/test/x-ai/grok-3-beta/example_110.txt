I'm returning the snippet with the merge conflict unresolved because the intent behind the two import statements is ambiguous without additional context about the specific usage of the imported classes or packages. On the `HEAD` side, specific classes (`Employee` and `Name`) from the `org.fest.test` package are imported, indicating a precise need for these classes. On the other side (`06e86330876dee7fcb1356794176b04a7161cf65`), a wildcard import (`org.fest.test.*`) is used, which could imply a broader dependency on multiple classes within that package or a simplification of imports. Without knowing the full scope of the codebase or the specific requirements, I cannot confidently decide whether to retain the specific imports or adopt the wildcard. Below is the original snippet with the conflict markers preserved.
