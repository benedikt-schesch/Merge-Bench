I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as provided, since the intent of the changes on the `HEAD` side is ambiguous due to the incomplete context of the `else` block. Without further information about what `HEAD` intended to achieve in the `else` block (e.g., whether it was a deliberate removal of `handleUnsupportedGenerator` or something else was intended), I cannot confidently resolve the conflict.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved, maintaining the original formatting and context:

```java
>>>>>>> bdcc9aaa22f9470ce4d424736aabbc49c4857931
                jsonGenerator.writeStartObject();
                jsonGenerator.writeFieldName("$numberDecimal");
                jsonGenerator.writeString(decimal.bigDecimalValue().toString());
                jsonGenerator.writeEndObject();
<<<<<<< HEAD
            } else {
                handleUnsupportedGenerator(jsonGenerator);
=======
>>>>>>> bdcc9aaa22f9470ce4d424736aabbc49c4857931
            }
        }
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
