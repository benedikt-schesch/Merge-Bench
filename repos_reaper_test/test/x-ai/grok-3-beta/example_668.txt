I'm returning the provided snippet with the conflict unresolved as the intent and semantics behind the changes are ambiguous. Without additional context or documentation on what `AttatchSourcesClasspathConfigurer` and `RemoveNonRuntimeProjectsConfigurer` are meant to achieve, I cannot determine which one should be included or if both should be combined. The snippet is preserved exactly as provided, including spacing and formatting, within markdown code syntax.

```java
>>>>>>> 4b0f0ad0ce6afc98a1fc78b9fe46584c41f478e8
    }

    @Provides
    List<RawClasspathConfigurer> provideRawClasspathConfigurers(PersistNonRuntimeClasspathConfigurer persistConfigurer,
<<<<<<< HEAD
            AttatchSourcesClasspathConfigurer attatchSourcesConfigurer) {
=======
            RemoveNonRuntimeProjectsConfigurer removeProjectsConfigurer) {
>>>>>>> 4b0f0ad0ce6afc98a1fc78b9fe46584c41f478e8
        final List<RawClasspathConfigurer> rawClasspathConfigurers = new ArrayList<RawClasspathConfigurer>();

        rawClasspathConfigurers.add(persistConfigurer);
        rawClasspathConfigurers.add(new RemoveNonRuntimeDependenciesConfigurer());
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

**Note on Conflict Resolution Ambiguity**: The conflict involves a parameter name and type difference in the method signature (`AttatchSourcesClasspathConfigurer` vs. `RemoveNonRuntimeProjectsConfigurer`). Without understanding the purpose of these configurers or seeing how they are used within the method body (which is incomplete in the snippet), it's not clear whether one should replace the other or if both are needed. If both configurers serve distinct purposes, a possible resolution could involve including both parameters, but this requires confirmation of their roles in the codebase. If you can provide more context or clarification on the intent of these classes, I can assist further in resolving the conflict.
