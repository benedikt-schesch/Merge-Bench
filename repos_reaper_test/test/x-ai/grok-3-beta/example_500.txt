I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet as is since the intent behind the changes isn't entirely clear without additional context about the codebase or the purpose of the texture objects. The conflict involves a difference in the type of texture object being used, and both sides might have valid reasons for their choice depending on the broader system design or library requirements.

Here is the provided code snippet preserved exactly as is with the merge conflict markers:

```java

	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d

	private TiledTextureRegion mBoxFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mCircleFaceTextureRegion;

	private Scene mScene;

```

**Analysis of Intent and Semantics:**  
- **HEAD (BitmapTexture):** This side uses `BitmapTexture`, which might imply a simpler or more specific texture representation, possibly tied to a single bitmap without additional atlas functionality. The intent could be to keep the texture management lightweight or compatible with a specific API or rendering system.
- **Other Branch (BitmapTextureAtlas):** This side uses `BitmapTextureAtlas`, which suggests an intent to manage multiple textures or regions within a single atlas for optimization purposes (like reducing draw calls or memory usage in a game engine). The intent might be performance optimization or adherence to a different design pattern.

**Reason for Not Resolving:**  
Without further context about the codebase (e.g., whether the project uses a texture atlas system, the specific library or engine like AndEngine, or the purpose of this class), it's ambiguous which choice is correct. Choosing one over the other could break functionality or go against the intended design. If you can provide additional context or clarification on the desired behavior, I can resolve the conflict accordingly. For now, the snippet is returned unchanged with the conflict markers intact.
