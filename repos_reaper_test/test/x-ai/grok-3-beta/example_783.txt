Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as provided, followed by an explanation of the intent and semantic resolution:

```java
    // Add extra bytes for the RPC header:
    //   4 bytes: Payload size (always present, even in HBase 0.95+).
    //   4 bytes: RPC ID.
    //   2 bytes: Length of the method name.
    //   N bytes: The method name.
<<<<<<< HEAD
    final int header = 4 + 4 + 2 + method.length

    final int header = 4 + 4 + 2 + method(server_version).length

```

### Explanation and Semantic Resolution

**Intent Analysis:**
- **HEAD Side (`method.length`):** This side calculates the header size using the length of a `method` variable, likely representing the method name as a string or byte array. The intent seems to be a straightforward computation of the method name's length without considering server version-specific logic at this point.
- **Other Side (`method(server_version).length`):** This side introduces a function or method call `method(server_version)`, which suggests that the method name or its representation might depend on the `server_version`. The intent appears to be adapting the method name length based on the server version, possibly to handle version-specific encoding or formatting.

**Semantic Conflict:**
The conflict arises because one side assumes a static `method` variable, while the other side introduces a dynamic computation of `method` based on `server_version`. Without further context about whether `method` is a simple string/byte array or a function that takes `server_version` as a parameter, the resolution is ambiguous. 

**Resolution Recommendation:**
Since the intent on the `d543609...` side introduces versioning logic (likely for compatibility with different server versions), it seems more contextually aware and forward-looking. However, without explicit confirmation of what `method(server_version)` does (e.g., is it a function returning a version-specific method name?), I cannot definitively resolve the conflict. The surrounding code also references `server_version` in the next lines, indicating that versioning is a relevant concern in this context.

Given the ambiguity, I am preserving the conflict as is. If further context or documentation about `method(server_version)` is available, the resolution could lean toward the version-aware approach. Alternatively, if `method` is indeed a static variable with no versioning dependency, the HEAD side would be more appropriate. For now, the snippet is returned unchanged with the conflict markers intact. If you can provide additional context or clarification on the nature of `method`, I can refine the resolution accordingly.
