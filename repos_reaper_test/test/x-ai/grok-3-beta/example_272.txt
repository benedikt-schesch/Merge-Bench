Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as provided, in markdown code syntax. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict. The difference between the two versions is purely formatting (line break in the `setKeyType` method call), with no functional or semantic difference in the logic. I will resolve the conflict by selecting the formatting from the `HEAD` version for consistency, as it is more compact and readable. Below is the snippet with the resolved conflict.

```java
        }

        POPackage pkg = new POPackage(new OperatorKey(scope,
                nig.getNextNodeId(scope)));
        LitePackager pkgr = new LitePackager();
        pkgr.setKeyType((fields == null || fields.length > 1) ? DataType.TUPLE : keyType);
        pkg.setPkgr(pkgr);
        pkg.setNumInps(1);
        mro.reducePlan.add(pkg);

        PhysicalPlan ep = new PhysicalPlan();
```

### Explanation of Resolution:
- **Intent and Semantics**: Both sides of the conflict are functionally identical. The difference lies only in the formatting of the ternary operator in `pkgr.setKeyType()`. The `HEAD` version keeps the expression on a single line, while the `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a` version splits it across two lines.
- **Resolution Choice**: I chose the `HEAD` version for its more concise formatting, which improves readability by avoiding unnecessary line breaks. Since there is no semantic difference, this choice does not affect the behavior of the code. If a specific coding style guide or team preference dictates otherwise, the other formatting could be adopted instead.
