Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict unchanged, as the intent and semantics behind the changes are ambiguous without additional context. I have preserved the exact formatting and spacing as provided. Following the snippet, I will explain my reasoning for not resolving the conflict.

```java
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	protected MenuScene mMenuScene;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mMenuTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mMenuTexture;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	protected TextureRegion mMenuResetTextureRegion;
	protected TextureRegion mMenuQuitTextureRegion;

	// ===========================================================
	// Constructors
```

### Reasoning:
The conflict arises from a difference in the type of the `mMenuTexture` field. On the `HEAD` side, it is defined as `BitmapTexture`, while on the branch side (commit `91801fdd...`), it is defined as `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Without additional context about the codebase or the purpose of this change, it is unclear which type is correct or intended for the `mMenuTexture` field. 

- **Possible Intent of HEAD (`BitmapTexture`)**: This could imply that `mMenuTexture` is meant to represent a single texture, and the type `BitmapTexture` aligns with other parts of the code or a specific design pattern in the project.
- **Possible Intent of Branch (`BitmapTextureAtlas`)**: This suggests that `mMenuTexture` might be intended to handle multiple textures or a texture atlas, which could be part of a broader optimization or refactoring effort (e.g., for menu items or sprites).

Since the semantics and intent behind this change are ambiguous, and there are no additional clues in the provided snippet (e.g., usage of `mMenuTexture` or related comments), I have chosen not to resolve the conflict. Resolving it without certainty could introduce bugs or misalign with the project's design goals. If additional context (e.g., how `mMenuTexture` is used or documentation about the types `BitmapTexture` and `BitmapTextureAtlas`) is available, I would be happy to assist further in resolving this conflict.
