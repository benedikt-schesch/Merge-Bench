I'll analyze the merge conflict in terms of intent and semantics. The conflict appears in a list of documentation or feature descriptions related to different operations that can be performed using certain methods. Let's look at the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (left side of conflict)**: This side does not include any additional list item between fetching a connection and executing operations in batch. It seems to maintain the original list without the addition of FQL query execution methods.
- **Branch `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` (right side of conflict)**: This side introduces an additional list item for executing FQL queries, including two specific methods: `executeFqlQuery` and `executeFqlMultiquery`. The intent is to document or highlight additional functionality related to FQL querying.

**Semantic Analysis**: The right side (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) is likely adding new functionality or documentation for FQL query execution that wasn't present in the HEAD. Since there is no conflicting or contradictory content on the HEAD side (it's simply an absence of content), the intent of adding the FQL query documentation should be preserved. It aligns with the structure of the list, which is to enumerate various operations and their associated methods.

**Resolution**: I will resolve the conflict by accepting the addition from the right side (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) as it introduces relevant content without contradicting the existing context.

Here is the entire snippet with the resolved conflict, maintaining the original context and spacing exactly as provided:

```java
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Fetch an object: use {@link #fetchObject(String, Class, Parameter...)} or
 * {@link #fetchObjects(List, Class, Parameter...)}</li>
 * <li>Fetch a connection: use {@link #fetchConnection(String, Class, Parameter...)}</li>
 * <li>Execute an FQL query: use {@link #executeFqlQuery(String, Class, Parameter...)} or
 * {@link #executeFqlMultiquery(Map, Class, Parameter...)}</li>
 * <li>Execute operations in batch: use {@link #executeBatch(BatchRequest...)} or {@link #executeBatch(List, List)}</li>
 * <li>Publish data: use {@link #publish(String, Class, Parameter...)} or
 * {@link #publish(String, Class, BinaryAttachment, Parameter...)}</li>
 * <li>Delete an object: use {@link #deleteObject(String, Parameter...)}</li>
