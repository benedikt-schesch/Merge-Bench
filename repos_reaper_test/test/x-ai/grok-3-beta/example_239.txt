Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge but have determined that the intent is ambiguous without further context about the purpose of the code changes. Therefore, I am returning the snippet unchanged.

<<<<<<< HEAD

**Explanation of Analysis:**
- **HEAD Side:** Includes an import for `java.lang.reflect.Method`, suggesting that the code in this branch may use reflection for some functionality (e.g., accessing methods dynamically).
- **Incoming Side (1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81):** Removes the `java.lang.reflect.Method` import, which could imply that the reflection-related code was removed or is no longer needed in this branch.
- **Ambiguity:** Without additional context about the purpose of the code or whether reflection is still required in the merged result, it is unclear whether the `java.lang.reflect.Method` import should be retained or removed. It is possible that the HEAD branch added functionality requiring reflection, while the incoming branch refactored or removed such functionality.

Since the intent cannot be confidently determined from the provided snippet alone, I have preserved the merge conflict as is. If additional context or code is available, I can revisit the resolution.
