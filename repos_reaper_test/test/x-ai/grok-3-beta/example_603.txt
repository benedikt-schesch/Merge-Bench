I'm going to analyze this merge conflict by considering the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The conflict is in how the `rawPicture` data is being accessed to create a JSON string (`picJson`). Let's examine the two versions:
- **HEAD**: Uses `rawPicture.get("data").toString()` which likely assumes `rawPicture` is a generic map-like structure or JSON object where `"data"` is a key to access a nested value.
- **a17acec0655b...**: Uses `rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString()` which suggests a more specific accessor method indicating that `rawPicture` is a JSON-specific object and `"data"` retrieves another JSON object.

The semantic intent of both sides seems to be the same: to extract a JSON string representation of the `"data"` field from `rawPicture` to deserialize it into a `ProfilePictureSource` object. The difference lies in the method of access, which depends on the type and API of `rawPicture`.

Since the context doesn't provide explicit information about the type of `rawPicture`, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict without additional information about the library or framework being used (e.g., whether `rawPicture` is a generic map or a specific JSON object like from a library such as Jackson or Gson). Given this ambiguity, I will return the snippet with the conflict unchanged, as modifying it without clarity on the correct API could introduce errors.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

<<<<<<< HEAD
    String picJson = rawPicture.get("data").toString();
=======
    String picJson = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString();
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    picture = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(picJson, ProfilePictureSource.class);
  }

  @JsonMappingCompleted
  protected void graphApi26LikesFallback() {
```

If additional context about the type of `rawPicture` or the library in use is provided, I can revisit this to propose a resolution. For now, the conflict remains as is due to ambiguity in intent.
