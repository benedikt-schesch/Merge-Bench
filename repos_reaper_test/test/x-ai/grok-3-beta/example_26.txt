I'm returning the provided code snippet with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent behind the conflicting changes is ambiguous without additional context. The `<<<<<<< HEAD` side includes additional imports (`StringMap`, `StringUtil`, and `ConfigurationException`), which might suggest an intent to use these utilities or handle configuration errors. However, the `>>>>>>> 5463b8f87d835f29ccb1c4feedad7ffad49380f6` side removes these imports, possibly indicating they are no longer needed or were added mistakenly. Without further information about the purpose of these imports or the broader changes in the codebase, I cannot confidently resolve the conflict.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:
