Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as I am unsure about the full intent and semantics of both sides of the merge due to the limited context provided. I will return the snippet exactly as given, without modifying the context or spacing.

```java
   *           If the provided {@code json} is invalid.
   * @since 1.6.7
   */
  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  public Connection(FacebookClient facebookClient, String json, Class<T> connectionType) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    List<T> dataList = new ArrayList<T>();
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

    if (json == null) {
      throw new FacebookJsonMappingException("You must supply non-null connection JSON.");
    }


```

**Explanation**:  
The conflict arises from one side (HEAD) having no additional code in the constructor initialization, while the other side (commit `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) introduces a `List<T> dataList = new ArrayList<T>();`. Without additional context about the purpose of `dataList` or how it is used in the rest of the constructor or class, it is ambiguous whether this initialization is necessary or if it was intentionally omitted in the HEAD version. If `dataList` is critical to the functionality of the `Connection` class (e.g., for storing parsed JSON data), it might be needed; otherwise, it could be extraneous or handled differently in HEAD. Therefore, I am preserving the conflict as is for further manual resolution or additional context.
