I'll help analyze and resolve the merge conflict based on the semantic intent of both changes. First, I'll return the snippet with full context as provided, unchanged, in markdown code syntax. Then, I'll explain my reasoning for the resolution.

```java
        setTranslationX(finalX);
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideClose() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
<<<<<<< HEAD
        animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
=======
        animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(
                SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Analysis and Resolution Reasoning

**Intent Analysis for `notifySidebarSlideClose()` method conflict:**

- **HEAD (left side):** The code uses `animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();` on a single line. The intent appears to be animating the sidebar to slide closed with a translation to the left (negative margin) using a predefined duration.
- **Incoming change (right side, commit c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c):** The same line of code is present, but the `setDuration` call is broken into a new line with an indentation, i.e., `animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(` followed by `SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();`. The functional intent is identical to HEAD; only the formatting differs (likely for readability or style consistency).

**Semantic Conclusion:** Both sides of the conflict for `notifySidebarSlideClose()` are functionally identical. The difference is purely stylistic (line break and indentation). There is no difference in behavior or logic.

**Resolution for `notifySidebarSlideClose()`:** Since the functionality is the same, I'll choose the formatting from the incoming change (right side) as it appears to prioritize readability with the line break. However, either choice would work semantically. I'll preserve the exact indentation and spacing from the incoming change.

**Second Conflict in `notifySidebarSlideOpen()`:** The second conflict marker appears incomplete in the provided snippet (it starts but doesn't show the full conflict or resolution). Since the snippet ends abruptly and doesn't provide the full context for the second conflict, I will leave it unresolved as is, per the instruction to return the same snippet if intent is ambiguous or incomplete.

### Resolved Code Snippet

```java
        setTranslationX(finalX);
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideClose() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
        animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(
                SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

**Note:** The second conflict in `notifySidebarSlideOpen()` is returned as is because the snippet is incomplete and lacks the full context to resolve it. If you provide the full conflict details for this section, I can assist further. For the first conflict in `notifySidebarSlideClose()`, I've resolved it by adopting the formatting from the incoming change while confirming that the semantic intent is preserved.
