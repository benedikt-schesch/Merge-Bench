Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics of both sides are clear and can be resolved. Following that, I will provide my reasoning and the resolved version of the snippet.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Preserved as Provided):
```java
				"EMAIL:cookiemonster@sesamestreet.com\n" + //
				"ADR:Sesamestreet 1\n" + //
				"NOTE:more cookies, please\n" + //
				"END:VCARD");
		assertNotNull(scheme);
<<<<<<< HEAD
		assertThat(scheme,instanceOf(VCard.class));
=======
		assertThat("wrong type", scheme, instanceOf(VCard.class));
>>>>>>> 7d8e78a2b152062a876d6f8f0f8bde7550278ed0
		VCard vcard = (VCard) scheme;
		assertEquals("Cookiemonster", vcard.getName());
		assertEquals("Sesamestreet 1", vcard.getAddress());
		assertEquals("CTV", vcard.getCompany());
		assertEquals("cookiemonster@sesamestreet.com", vcard.getEmail());
```

### Reasoning for Resolution:
- **Intent Analysis**: The merge conflict involves a single line of code where an `assertThat` statement checks if the `scheme` object is an instance of the `VCard` class.
  - The `HEAD` version uses `assertThat(scheme, instanceOf(VCard.class))`, which is a straightforward assertion without an explicit error message.
  - The version from commit `7d8e78a2b152062a876d6f8f0f8bde7550278ed0` uses `assertThat("wrong type", scheme, instanceOf(VCard.class))`, which includes a custom error message "wrong type" to provide more context if the assertion fails.
- **Semantic Goal**: Both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goalâ€”verifying that `scheme` is of type `VCard`. The difference lies in the additional error message in the second version, which enhances debugging by making the failure context clearer.
- **Resolution Decision**: Including an error message is a better practice in assertions as it provides more information when tests fail. Therefore, I will adopt the version with the custom error message from the branch (commit `7d8e78a2b152062a876d6f8f0f8bde7550278ed0`).

### Resolved Snippet:
```java
				"EMAIL:cookiemonster@sesamestreet.com\n" + //
				"ADR:Sesamestreet 1\n" + //
				"NOTE:more cookies, please\n" + //
				"END:VCARD");
		assertNotNull(scheme);
		assertThat("wrong type", scheme, instanceOf(VCard.class));
		VCard vcard = (VCard) scheme;
		assertEquals("Cookiemonster", vcard.getName());
		assertEquals("Sesamestreet 1", vcard.getAddress());
		assertEquals("CTV", vcard.getCompany());
		assertEquals("cookiemonster@sesamestreet.com", vcard.getEmail());
