I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and resolve it based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

**Analysis of Intent:**
- The `HEAD` version describes the class as containing data and functionality from `DefaultFacebookClient`.
- The `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` version expands on this by stating the class contains data and functionality common to both `DefaultFacebookClient` and `DefaultLegacyFacebookClient`.
- The intent of the `HEAD` version seems to focus narrowly on `DefaultFacebookClient`, while the other version broadens the scope to include `DefaultLegacyFacebookClient`, suggesting a more comprehensive or updated description of the class's purpose.

**Resolution Strategy:**
- The version from `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` appears to be more inclusive and likely reflects an update or expansion of the class's responsibilities to cover both implementations.
- Therefore, adopting the broader description aligns better with the likely intent to document the class's full scope.

Here is the resolved code snippet with the full context preserved:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Map.Entry;
import java.util.Set;

/**
 * Base class that contains data and functionality common to {@link DefaultFacebookClient} and
 * {@link DefaultLegacyFacebookClient}.

abstract class BaseFacebookClient {
