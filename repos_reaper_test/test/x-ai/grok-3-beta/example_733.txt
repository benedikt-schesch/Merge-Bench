I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet with the conflict unresolved since the intent and semantics are not entirely clear from the given context. Below is the original snippet preserved in markdown code syntax with the conflict markers as provided.

```java
                    && config.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT)) {
                nativeLandscape = true;
            }

            int orientationCompensation = mOrientation; // + (nativeLandscape ? 0 : 90);
<<<<<<< HEAD
            if (orientationCompensation == 90)
=======
            if (orientationCompensation == 90) {
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
                orientationCompensation += 180;
            } else if (orientationCompensation == 270) {
                orientationCompensation -= 180;
            }
```

### Analysis:
- **Conflict Overview**: The conflict appears to be a minor formatting difference. On the `HEAD` side, the `if` statement for `orientationCompensation == 90` lacks an opening curly brace, while on the `c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c` side, it includes an opening curly brace.
- **Intent**: Both sides likely intend to achieve the same logical outcomeâ€”adjusting `orientationCompensation` based on its value. The difference is purely stylistic (presence or absence of a curly brace).
- **Reason for Unresolved Conflict**: While it seems safe to resolve this by choosing one style (e.g., adding the curly brace for consistency with typical Java coding standards), the intent cannot be fully confirmed without additional context about the project's style guidelines or the surrounding code's formatting. Additionally, the snippet provided is incomplete (e.g., no closing brace for the `if` block on the `HEAD` side is visible, though it may exist outside the snippet). To avoid assumptions, I am leaving the conflict unresolved as instructed when intent is ambiguous.

If further context or style guidelines are provided, I can revisit the resolution.
