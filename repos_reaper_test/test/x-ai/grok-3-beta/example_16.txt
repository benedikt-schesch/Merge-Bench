I'll return the provided snippet with the merge conflict unchanged, as the intent of the changes on both sides of the merge is ambiguous without additional context. The `HEAD` side includes imports for `Component` and `CameraComponent`, suggesting an intent to work with specific entity components. The other side (commit `67bcb76a96f358fc131320b0611ffaa3bf3678c2`) has no additional imports in the conflict area, which might imply a cleanup or removal of unnecessary imports, but it's unclear whether this was intentional or an oversight. Without further information on the purpose of the code or the broader changes in each branch, I cannot confidently resolve the conflict.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:
