I'll resolve this merge conflict based on the semantic intent of both changes. The conflict is regarding the version number of the Google API Client Library for Java. One side updates it to `1.3.3-alpha` (HEAD), while the other side updates it to `1.4.0-alpha` (from commit `f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b`). Typically, version numbers increment, and the intent seems to be updating to the latest version. Since `1.4.0-alpha` is a higher version number than `1.3.3-alpha`, it is reasonable to assume that the intent is to adopt the newer version.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved:

```java
  /**
   * Current version of the Google API Client Library for Java.
   *
   * @since 1.3
   */
  public static final String VERSION = "1.4.0-alpha";

  /**
   * Line separator to use for this OS, i.e. {@code "\n"} or {@code "\r\n"}.
   */
  public static final String LINE_SEPARATOR = System.getProperty("line.separator");
```
