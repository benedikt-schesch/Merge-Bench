Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, followed by my analysis and resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge. I will first present the original snippet unchanged, then provide the resolved version.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Unchanged)

			);
			publishWarningMessage(title, text);
		}

```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The intent here is to log a warning message about ambiguity in names (User/Group) related to resource access permissions or node ownership during data deployment. It uses `String.join("\n\t", ambiguousPrincipals)` to format the list of ambiguous principals, which implies a simple concatenation of a list of strings with a newline and tab separator.
- **Branch 83418dbbb7fe... (Right Side)**: The intent is similar, but it refines the message by replacing "resource access permissions" with "grants" (possibly for clarity or consistency with terminology elsewhere). Additionally, it improves the formatting of the `ambiguousPrincipals` list by sorting it using `ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))` for better readability. It also adds an exclamation mark to the end of the ambiguity warning sentence for emphasis.
- **Common Intent**: Both sides aim to log a warning about ambiguous names affecting node access rights restoration during data deployment. The key differences are in the wording of the message and the handling of the `ambiguousPrincipals` list formatting.

### Resolution Rationale
- **Message Wording**: The term "grants" from the right side seems to be a more concise or contextually appropriate term compared to "resource access permissions" from the left side. I'll adopt "grants" for clarity.
- **Emphasis**: The exclamation mark added in the right side ("imported!") adds emphasis to the warning, which aligns with the intent of making the message more impactful. I'll keep this.
- **List Formatting**: The right side's use of `stream().sorted()` to sort the `ambiguousPrincipals` list before joining improves readability and consistency, especially if the list could be unordered. This is a clear improvement over the left side's `String.join()` without sorting, so I'll adopt the right side's approach.
- **Overall**: The right side (branch 83418dbbb7fe...) appears to be a more polished version of the same intent, with better formatting and slightly clearer wording. Thus, I will resolve in favor of the right side while ensuring the surrounding context remains unchanged.

### Resolved Snippet
```java
>>>>>>> 83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965
					+ "Consider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.";

			logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
					+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
					+ "\tFor the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for grants or node ownership during data deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of this ambiguity, node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported!\n\n"
					+ "\t" + ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
					+ "\n\n\tConsider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.\n"
					+ "###############################################################################"
			);
			publishWarningMessage(title, text);
		}

```

### Conclusion
The resolved code adopts the improvements from the right side (branch 83418dbbb7fe...) as they enhance clarity and readability while maintaining the original intent of logging a warning about ambiguous names during data deployment. If there are domain-specific reasons to prefer "resource access permissions" over "grants" or to avoid sorting the list, this resolution can be revisited with additional context.
