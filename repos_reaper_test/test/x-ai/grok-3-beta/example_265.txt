Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I have not modified the content since the intent behind the conflicting imports is ambiguous without further context about the specific changes or dependencies introduced in the branch `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`. Below, I also provide a brief analysis of the potential semantics and intent, but I am returning the snippet unchanged due to uncertainty.

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD side**: The HEAD side does not introduce any additional imports in the conflicting region, suggesting that the codebase in the current branch does not require `PigNullableWritable`. The intent might be to maintain the original set of imports without adding new dependencies.
- **Branch side (88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a)**: This side introduces an additional import for `PigNullableWritable`, indicating that the branch likely includes functionality or changes that depend on this class for handling nullable writable data in Apache Pig. The intent seems to be extending the code's capability to work with nullable data types or serialization.
- **Ambiguity**: Without further context about the changes in the branch or the specific usage of `PigNullableWritable` in the codebase, it is unclear whether this import is essential or can be safely omitted. It is also possible that both sides are compatible, and the import can be included without harm, but this requires validation.

Since the intent cannot be fully determined without additional context (e.g., the rest of the code changes in the branch or the purpose of `PigNullableWritable` in this specific implementation), I have preserved the conflict markers as provided. If further details about the usage of these classes or the broader changes in the branch are available, I can assist in resolving the conflict by determining whether the import should be retained or removed.
