Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. After the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the intent and semantics behind the conflict and propose a resolution.

```java

  @Facebook("picture")
  private JsonObject rawPicture;

  /**

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict

This merge conflict involves a field named `picture` with differing types on the two branches:

- **HEAD (Local Branch)**: Declares `picture` as a `ProfilePictureSource` type. This suggests that the intent is to represent the picture as a structured object, likely a custom class or enum that encapsulates specific properties or behaviors related to a profile picture. The use of `@Getter` and `@Setter` (likely from Lombok) indicates that this field is intended to be accessed and modified with automatically generated getter and setter methods.
- **a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe (Remote Branch)**: Declares `picture` as a `String`. This implies an intent to store the picture as a simple string value, possibly a URL or a base64-encoded string representing the image data.

Additionally, there is a field `rawPicture` annotated with `@Facebook("picture")` of type `JsonObject` in the context, which appears in both versions and might be relevant. This suggests that there is a raw JSON representation of the picture data coming from a Facebook API or similar source, which could be deserialized or processed into either a `String` or a `ProfilePictureSource` object.

### Semantic Intent
- The `HEAD` branch likely aims to provide a more strongly-typed and structured representation of a profile picture, possibly for better encapsulation, validation, or ease of use within the application.
- The remote branch aims for simplicity by using a `String`, which might be sufficient if the picture is just a URL or identifier that doesn't need further processing at this level.
- Both branches seem to be working with the same underlying data (as evidenced by the `rawPicture` field), but they differ in how they want to expose or model this data in the application.

### Proposed Resolution
Given the context, I believe the intent of the `HEAD` branch (using `ProfilePictureSource`) is likely more aligned with a robust and maintainable design, as it suggests a custom type tailored for profile pictures, which could include additional metadata or behavior. However, if `ProfilePictureSource` is not well-defined or over-engineered for the use case, the `String` approach might be more pragmatic.

Since there is a `rawPicture` field of type `JsonObject`, it is reasonable to assume that the application processes JSON data from an external source (e.g., Facebook API). The `picture` field seems to be a processed or simplified version of `rawPicture`. Using `ProfilePictureSource` might indicate a custom class designed to deserialize or interpret the JSON data into a structured form, which aligns with good design practices.

Without explicit documentation or further context about what `ProfilePictureSource` is or how it's used downstream, I will lean towards preserving the structured approach (`ProfilePictureSource`) as it likely represents a more intentional design. However, to acknowledge the simplicity of the `String` approach, I'll note that if `ProfilePictureSource` is unnecessary complexity, the resolution could be adjusted to use `String`.

### Resolved Code Snippet
Here is the resolved version of the code snippet with the conflict markers removed, adopting the `HEAD` branch's approach (using `ProfilePictureSource`) based on the analysis above. The rest of the context remains unchanged.

```java
   * @since 1.6.13
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  private ProfilePictureSource picture;

  @Facebook("picture")
  private JsonObject rawPicture;

  /**
```

### Final Notes
If you or the team determine that `ProfilePictureSource` is not the correct approach (e.g., if it's not fully implemented or if the use case truly only needs a `String`), the resolution can be revised to use `private String picture;` instead. If further clarification is needed about the purpose of `ProfilePictureSource` or the intended usage of `picture`, I recommend discussing with the team or reviewing additional context before finalizing the resolution.
