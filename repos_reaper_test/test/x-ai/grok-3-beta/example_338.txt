I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet with the conflict as is, since the intent behind the resource string used for the menu item label is ambiguous without additional context about the application's naming conventions or localization strategy.

```java
  }


  @Override
  public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    MenuItem item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_DM, 0, R.string.page_title_direct_messages);
=======
    MenuItem item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_DM, 0, R.string.cmenu_direct_message);
>>>>>>> ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62
    item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_send);

    item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_FOLLOW, 0, R.string.user_label_follow);
    item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_add);


```

**Analysis of Intent and Semantics:**
- **HEAD** uses `R.string.page_title_direct_messages`, which suggests the label for the menu item might be intended as a title or a more formal representation of "Direct Messages."
- **ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62** uses `R.string.cmenu_direct_message`, which might indicate a context-specific or concise naming convention for context menu items (possibly prefixed with `cmenu_` for clarity or organization in resources).

Without further context on the naming conventions or the purpose of these resource strings in the broader application, it's unclear which label best fits the intended user experience or design guidelines of the app. Therefore, I leave the conflict unresolved for manual review by someone familiar with the project's standards. If needed, a resolution could involve selecting the more appropriate string resource based on the app's UX guidelines or even combining the intent if both strings are meant to represent the same concept in different contexts.
