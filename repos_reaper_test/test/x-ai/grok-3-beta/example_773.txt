Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as provided, in markdown code syntax:

```java

  /**
   * Specifies a particular column qualifier to scan.
   * <p>
   * Note that specifying a qualifier without a family has no effect.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
   * You need to call {@link #setFamily(byte[])} too.
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
   * @param qualifier The column qualifier.
   * <strong>This byte array will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @throws IllegalStateException if scanning already started.
   */
  public void setQualifier(final byte[] qualifier) {

```

### Analysis and Resolution Attempt:
After analyzing the merge conflict semantically, I can infer the intent of both sides:
- **HEAD (no change)**: The original code does not include any additional documentation regarding the need to call `setFamily(byte[])`.
- **Incoming change (d543609...)**: The incoming change adds a line to the Javadoc to explicitly inform the user that they must also call `setFamily(byte[])` for the qualifier to have an effect, enhancing clarity in the documentation.

**Intent**: The intent of the incoming change is to improve the documentation by making it explicit that `setFamily(byte[])` must be called alongside `setQualifier(byte[])` for the operation to work as expected. The HEAD side does not contradict this but simply lacks the additional clarification.

**Resolution**: Since the incoming change adds valuable information to the documentation without conflicting with the original intent (it only enhances clarity), I recommend resolving the conflict by accepting the incoming change. The resolved code would look like this:

```java

  /**
   * Specifies a particular column qualifier to scan.
   * <p>
   * Note that specifying a qualifier without a family has no effect.
   * You need to call {@link #setFamily(byte[])} too.
   * @param qualifier The column qualifier.
   * <strong>This byte array will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @throws IllegalStateException if scanning already started.
   */
  public void setQualifier(final byte[] qualifier) {

```
