I'll return the snippet with the full context preserved as provided, and I'll resolve the merge conflict based on the semantic intent of both sides. My analysis is that the `HEAD` side does not include the `Picture` class or the `@TODO` comment, likely intending to omit or remove this part, while the `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` side includes the `Picture` class with a `@TODO` comment indicating it might be temporary or pending refactoring. Since the intent of including the `Picture` class appears to be relevant for now (with a note for future refactoring), I will resolve the conflict by keeping the content from the `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` side.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved exactly as provided:

```java
    }

  }

  /**
   * @TODO remove this on type refactoring
   */
  public static class Picture extends ProfilePictureSource {
    // nothing here
  }

  /**
   * Represents the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user">Sport Graph API type</a>.
