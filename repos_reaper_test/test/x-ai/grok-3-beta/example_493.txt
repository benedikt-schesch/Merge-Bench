I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent behind the changes is ambiguous without additional context about the codebase or the specific purpose of `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas`. Both sides of the merge seem to be defining a texture-related field but with different types or implementations, and it's unclear whether they are meant to serve the same purpose or if one is a refactoring or update of the other.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java

	protected Camera mCamera;

	protected Scene mMainScene;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	protected MenuScene mMenuScene;

<<<<<<< HEAD

```

If you can provide additional context about the purpose of these fields or the direction of the project, I can offer a more informed resolution. For now, I am preserving the original content to avoid making an incorrect assumption.
