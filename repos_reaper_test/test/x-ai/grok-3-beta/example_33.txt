I'm returning the provided code snippet in markdown code syntax with the merge conflict unresolved, as the intent behind the changes on both sides of the merge is ambiguous. Without additional context or documentation regarding the purpose of the import statement `org.spout.math.imaginary.Quaternion` (which appears only in the `HEAD` side), itâ€™s unclear whether it should be included or excluded. The `cc070305` side has an empty line or potentially a deletion of content, which could imply that the import is not needed or was intentionally removed. Since the semantics and intent cannot be definitively determined from the snippet alone, I will preserve the original conflict markers and context as is.
