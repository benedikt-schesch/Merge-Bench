Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including all context, spacing, and formatting. I have analyzed the semantic intent of both sides of the merge conflict. However, since the conflict section appears to be empty on both sides (no content between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`, or between `=======` and `>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`), the intent is ambiguous. It seems there might be a formatting issue or missing content in the conflict markers. Therefore, I am returning the snippet unchanged, as I cannot determine the intended resolution based on the given information.

If there is additional context or if content was inadvertently omitted within the conflict markers, please provide the updated snippet or clarification, and I will be happy to assist with the resolution.
