I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet with my resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

```java
    @Override
    public String getVersion() {
        String version = null;
        try {
            version = ServerInfo.class.getPackage().getImplementationVersion();
        } catch (Exception e) {
        }
        return version != null ? version : "1.4";
    }

    @Override
    public String getStartupTime() {
        return startupTime;
```

**Resolution Explanation**: 
- The conflict is in the fallback version number returned when `version` is null. The `HEAD` branch uses "1.4" while the merged branch (`c85cbed2`) uses "1.2".
- Semantically, both sides aim to provide a default version number if the actual version cannot be retrieved. The difference in version numbers likely reflects different updates or intentions regarding which version to fall back to.
- Since "1.4" from `HEAD` is presumably a later version (higher number) and represents the current state of the main branch, I chose to keep "1.4" as the default version. This assumes that the `HEAD` version is more recent or relevant unless context suggests otherwise.
- If there is additional context or documentation indicating that "1.2" is the correct fallback due to compatibility or other reasons, this resolution should be revisited. However, without such information, I prioritize the `HEAD` value.
