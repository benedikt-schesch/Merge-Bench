I'll analyze the merge conflict based on the provided snippet. Let's look at the intent and semantics of the changes from both sides.

**Analysis of the Merge Conflict:**
- **HEAD (left side):** No additional import statement is added. The intent seems to be maintaining the original set of imports without introducing new dependencies.
- **Incoming change (1488b22, right side):** Adds an import for `org.apache.pig.impl.plan.OperatorKey`. The intent is likely to include this class for use in the codebase, possibly for referencing or working with operator keys in the logical plan building process.

**Resolution Reasoning:**
- The conflict is about whether to include an additional import statement for `OperatorKey`. Since the incoming change explicitly adds this import, it suggests that the code in the incoming branch requires this class for some functionality (likely related to the logical plan or operator handling in Pig).
- On the HEAD side, the absence of this import suggests it wasn't needed in that branch's context. However, semantic merge resolution typically prioritizes inclusion over exclusion to avoid breaking dependent code.
- Since the snippet does not show further context where `OperatorKey` is used, I’ll assume the incoming change’s intent to include it is valid and necessary for the codebase to function correctly after the merge.
- There is no harm in including the import even if it's unused, as it won’t affect runtime behavior (modern IDEs and compilers ignore unused imports).

**Resolved Snippet (including full context):**

```java
import java.util.Map;

import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.parser.ParseException;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.parser.QueryParser;
import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.OperatorKey;


/**
 * PlanBuilder class outputs a logical plan given a query String and set of ValidIDs
 * 
```

**Conclusion:**
I have resolved the conflict by including the additional import from the incoming change (`org.apache.pig.impl.plan.OperatorKey`), as it aligns with the apparent intent to support functionality that depends on this class. The context and spacing are preserved as provided. If this import turns out to be unnecessary, it can be safely removed in a later cleanup without impacting functionality.
