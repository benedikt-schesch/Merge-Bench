I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet as is since the intent and resolution seem clear. Below is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, followed by my analysis and resolution.

### Original Snippet with Conflict (Preserved as Provided)
```java
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
  private final Metrics metrics;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showGameLinkProvider;
  private final Provider<String> gamePermalinkFormatProvider;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showRoundLinkProvider;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private final Provider<String> roundPermalinkFormatProvider;

  // All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.
=======

  // All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.
  private final Provider<String> roundPermalinkFormatProvider;
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
  private final Provider<Boolean> allowBlankCardsProvider;
  private final long created = System.currentTimeMillis();
  /**
   * Lock object to prevent judging during idle judge detection and vice-versa.
   */
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **Context of the Code**: This snippet appears to be part of a class (likely related to a game or application settings) where several dependency-injected fields (using `Provider`) are defined, along with a timestamp and a comment about a lock object.
- **Conflict Details**:
  - On the `HEAD` side, the field `roundPermalinkFormatProvider` is declared before a comment about moving delays to `pyx.properties`.
  - On the other branch (`5adedd248`), the same field `roundPermalinkFormatProvider` is declared after the comment about moving delays to `pyx.properties`.
  - The only difference is the ordering of the comment and the field declaration.
- **Intent**:
  - Both sides intend to include the `roundPermalinkFormatProvider` field and the comment about delays.
  - The conflict is purely about the placement of the comment relative to the field declaration, which does not affect the functionality or semantics of the code since the comment is just descriptive and not tied to specific logic.
- **Resolution Strategy**:
  - Since the comment’s placement does not impact the code’s behavior, I will prioritize a clean ordering of fields and comments. Typically, related fields are grouped together, and comments about configuration (like delays) can be placed after the field declarations for clarity.
  - I will resolve the conflict by placing the `roundPermalinkFormatProvider` field declaration with the other related `Provider` fields and keep the comment grouped logically with the fields.

### Resolved Snippet
```java
  private final Metrics metrics;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showGameLinkProvider;
  private final Provider<String> gamePermalinkFormatProvider;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showRoundLinkProvider;
  private final Provider<String> roundPermalinkFormatProvider;

  // All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.
  private final Provider<Boolean> allowBlankCardsProvider;
  private final long created = System.currentTimeMillis();
  /**
   * Lock object to prevent judging during idle judge detection and vice-versa.
   */
```

### Explanation of Resolution
- I retained all field declarations in a logical order, grouping related `Provider` fields together.
- The comment about delays is placed after the `roundPermalinkFormatProvider` declaration, as it appears to be a general note (possibly about configuration or future refactoring) and does not specifically pertain to one field over another.
- This resolution preserves the intent of both sides of the merge: including the field `roundPermalinkFormatProvider` and maintaining the comment. The chosen order enhances readability by keeping field declarations together.
