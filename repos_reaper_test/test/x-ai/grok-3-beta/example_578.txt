I'm returning the snippet with the merge conflict unresolved as the intent of the conflicting changes is ambiguous. The `HEAD` side includes an import for `JsonMapper`, while the other side (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) appears to remove or not include this import. Without additional context about the purpose of this import or the changes intended in the merge, it's unclear whether `JsonMapper` should be included or excluded.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved, formatted in markdown code syntax:
