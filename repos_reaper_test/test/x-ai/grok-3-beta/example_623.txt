I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is since the intent behind the conflicting changes is ambiguous. The conflict involves the presence or absence of a `serialVersionUID` field, and without additional context or information about the requirements (e.g., whether serialization is necessary or if the field was intentionally removed), it's unclear how to resolve it semantically.

Here is the original snippet with the full context preserved in markdown code syntax, without any modifications:

```java

  }

  public static class KeyedType extends NamedFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String key;


```
