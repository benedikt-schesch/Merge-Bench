Below is the snippet of code with the merge conflict, presented in markdown code syntax with the full context preserved exactly as provided, including spacing. Following that, I will explain my reasoning for the resolution or decision to keep the conflict as is.

```java
    }

    public String toString() {
      // When running the application as a native image, append `-graalvm` to the
      // version.
<<<<<<< HEAD
      String imageCode = System.getProperty(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY);
      if (imageCode != null && imageCode.equals(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME)){
=======
      String imageCode = System.getProperty("org.graalvm.nativeimage.imagecode");
      if (imageCode != null && imageCode.equals("runtime")) {
>>>>>>> 1055ff5de3675837270f9739454829ed0cc14cec
        String[] tokens = versionString.split(" ");
        if (tokens.length > 0 && tokens[0].startsWith("gl-java")) {
          tokens[0] += "-graalvm";
          return Joiner.on(" ").join(tokens);
        }

```

### Reasoning and Resolution Analysis

**Intent and Semantics Analysis:**
- **HEAD Side:** The code uses a property key `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY` and a value `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME` which are presumably defined constants elsewhere in the codebase. This approach suggests an intent to abstract or customize the property key and value, making the code more maintainable or configurable. The closing brace `{` is incomplete on this side, likely a formatting issue in the diff.
- **Other Side (Commit 1055ff5):** The code explicitly uses hardcoded values `"org.graalvm.nativeimage.imagecode"` for the property key and `"runtime"` for the value. This approach is more direct and likely aligns with the specific GraalVM native image context. The closing brace `}` is properly formatted here.

**Conflict Resolution Decision:**
The intent of both sides is to check if the application is running as a GraalVM native image by inspecting a system property and comparing its value to determine the runtime context. The difference lies in whether to use hardcoded values or abstracted constants.

- **Favoring HEAD (Constants):** Using constants (`PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY` and `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME`) is generally better practice as it promotes maintainability and avoids hardcoded strings, assuming these constants are defined elsewhere and are consistent with the expected GraalVM property names.
- **Favoring Other Side (Hardcoded):** The hardcoded approach is more explicit and ensures clarity, especially if the constants are not yet defined or if there is a risk of mismatch. It directly references the GraalVM-specific property documented in their ecosystem.
- **Ambiguity:** Without visibility into whether `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY` and `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME` are defined and match the expected GraalVM values (`"org.graalvm.nativeimage.imagecode"` and `"runtime"`), it is not safe to assume either side is definitively correct.

**Conclusion:**
Given the ambiguity regarding the definition and values of the constants on the HEAD side, I am unable to definitively resolve the conflict without additional context about the codebase (e.g., whether the constants are defined and match the GraalVM defaults). Therefore, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact as provided above. If further context is available (such as the definition of the constants), I can revisit the resolution.

If you can provide additional information or prefer a specific resolution based on project conventions (e.g., always prefer constants or always use GraalVM defaults), I can adjust accordingly. As it stands, preserving the conflict ensures no incorrect assumptions are made.
