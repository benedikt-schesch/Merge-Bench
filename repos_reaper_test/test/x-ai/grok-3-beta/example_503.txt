I'll analyze the merge conflict in the provided code snippet and provide the full context with my resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides.

Here is the code snippet with the resolved conflict:

```java
	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;
	private BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas mBuildableBitmapTextureAtlas;
	private BaseTextureRegion[] mSVGTestTextureRegions;

	// ===========================================================
	// Constructors
	// ===========================================================
```

**Explanation of Resolution:**

- **Conflict Analysis**: The conflict arises from two different variable names for what appears to be the same field representing a texture object.
  - On the `HEAD` side, the variable is named `mBuildableTexture` with a type `BuildableBitmapTexture`.
  - On the `91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d` side, the variable is named `mBuildableBitmapTextureAtlas` with a type `BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas`.
- **Semantic Intent**:
  - Both sides likely refer to a texture atlas or texture object that is buildable, used for rendering or managing bitmap textures in a game or graphics engine context (given the surrounding code with `Camera` and `TextureRegion`).
  - The name `mBuildableBitmapTextureAtlas` (from the second side) is more specific and descriptive, as "Atlas" often implies a collection or mapping of textures, which aligns well with the context of managing multiple texture regions (as seen with `mSVGTestTextureRegions`).
  - The type `BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas` also seems to be a more precise or updated naming convention compared to `BuildableBitmapTexture`, suggesting it might be a newer or more accurate representation of the object's purpose.
- **Resolution**: I chose `private BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas mBuildableBitmapTextureAtlas;` from the second side (`91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d`) because it appears to be more descriptive and aligned with typical naming conventions in graphics programming where "Atlas" denotes a texture collection. This choice assumes that the underlying type or class name might have been updated or refined in the codebase represented by the second side. If the types are indeed different and incompatible, further context would be needed, but based on naming and intent, this is the most likely correct resolution.
