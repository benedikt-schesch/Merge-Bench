I'll analyze the merge conflict by looking at the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

**Analysis of Intent:**
- **HEAD (left side):** Imports `org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobConf` and `org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType`. The intent seems to be using a specific `ExecType` from `PigServer` and including `JobConf` which might be related to older Hadoop MapReduce configurations.
- **Branch 1488b22 (right side):** Imports `org.apache.pig.FuncSpec` and `org.apache.pig.ExecType`. The intent here seems to focus on using `FuncSpec` for user-defined functions in Pig and directly importing `ExecType` from `org.apache.pig` rather than through a subpackage like `PigServer`.
- **Semantic Difference:** 
  - The key conflict is around `ExecType`. HEAD uses `PigServer.ExecType` which might relate to a specific or older API structure, while the other branch directly uses `ExecType` from `org.apache.pig`, suggesting a possible refactoring or update in the API structure.
  - Additionally, `JobConf` (from HEAD) and `FuncSpec` (from branch) serve different purposes. `JobConf` is likely for Hadoop job configuration, while `FuncSpec` relates to Pig's function specifications.
- **Potential Resolution:** Since the imports serve different purposes and there’s no direct overlap except for `ExecType`, a semantic merge should retain imports from both sides, ensuring compatibility with code that might use either. For `ExecType`, I need to determine if `PigServer.ExecType` and `ExecType` resolve to the same class. Without deeper context into the codebase (e.g., API version or usage), I’ll assume they might be equivalent or one is deprecated, but I will preserve both for safety unless they conflict explicitly.

**Decision:** Since the exact intent or API compatibility isn’t clear (e.g., whether `PigServer.ExecType` and `ExecType` are interchangeable or from different versions), I will return the snippet unresolved as provided to avoid introducing potential errors. The context does not provide enough information to confidently merge without risking breaking the code.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the conflict preserved:
