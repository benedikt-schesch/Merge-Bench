Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge but, due to ambiguity in the intent of the changes, I am returning the snippet unchanged. Following the snippet, I will provide an explanation of my analysis.

```java
import javax.annotation.Nonnull;
import javax.annotation.Nullable;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils;
=======
>>>>>>> 31d7966e3896819a99b31f10e83e864e3805bcbd
import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;

/**
 * Various utility methods that don't have more proper home.
 *
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD Side**: The `HEAD` side of the merge includes an import for `org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils`, which suggests that the code in this branch likely uses this utility for cryptographic hashing or digest operations.
- **Incoming Side (31d7966e...)**: The incoming side does not include any additional imports beyond what is in the conflict markers (it appears empty within the conflict region except for the commit reference). However, after the conflict markers, there is an import for `org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils`, which is present in both sides or after the conflict and suggests usage of file operations.
- **Ambiguity**: Without further context or visibility into the actual code that uses these imports, it is unclear whether both imports are needed or if one side's import should take precedence. `DigestUtils` and `FileUtils` serve entirely different purposes (hashing vs. file operations), and there is no clear indication of whether the codebase requires one, the other, or both. The incoming side might have removed `DigestUtils` intentionally, or it might be an accidental omission. Similarly, the `HEAD` side might not require `FileUtils`, or it could be an oversight.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of additional context or code to determine the intended functionality, I am unable to definitively resolve theconflict. The snippet is returned as provided to ensure no unintended changes are introduced. If further context (e.g., the body of the class or methods using these imports) is available, I can reassess the intent and propose a resolution. A potential resolution could be to include both imports if both functionalities are needed, but this cannot be confirmed at this stage.
