Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics are clear enough to resolve but I will follow the instruction to return the snippet unchanged if there is any ambiguity. After analysis, I believe I can propose a resolution based on the intent of both sides. 

First, let me present the original snippet with the conflict as provided:

```java
            return;

        case STRING: {
            // Gather up all the remaining arguments into a string and pass them into
            // grunt.
<<<<<<< HEAD
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
=======
            StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
            String remainders[] = opts.getRemainingArgs();
            for (int i = 0; i < remainders.length; i++) {
                if (i != 0) sb.append(' ');
                sb.append(remainders[i]);
            }
```

### Analysis and Resolution Reasoning
- **Intent and Semantics**: Both sides of the merge aim to create a string by concatenating remaining arguments with spaces between them, likely to pass into a process or command (referred to as "grunt"). The only difference is the use of `StringBuilder` (from the HEAD branch) versus `StringBuffer` (from the commit `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`).
- **Difference**: `StringBuilder` is generally preferred in modern Java for non-thread-safe operations due to better performance (it is not synchronized), while `StringBuffer` is thread-safe but slower. Without additional context about thread safety requirements, itâ€™s reasonable to assume that `StringBuilder` is the better choice for this scenario, as it aligns with common Java practices unless synchronization is explicitly needed.
- **Resolution**: I will resolve the conflict by choosing `StringBuilder` over `StringBuffer`, assuming this code does not run in a multi-threaded context where synchronization is critical. If thread safety were a concern, the original author of `StringBuffer` might have documented or implied it, but no such context is provided.

Below is the resolved snippet with the conflict markers removed and the intent preserved:

```java
            return;

        case STRING: {
            // Gather up all the remaining arguments into a string and pass them into
            // grunt.
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            String remainders[] = opts.getRemainingArgs();
            for (int i = 0; i < remainders.length; i++) {
                if (i != 0) sb.append(' ');
                sb.append(remainders[i]);
            }
```

### Note
If there is a specific requirement for thread safety in the broader context of this code (not visible in the provided snippet), `StringBuffer` might be the correct choice. Since no such context is provided, I have made the decision based on common Java practices favoring `StringBuilder`. If you have additional context or concerns about thread safety, please let me know, and I can revisit the resolution.
