I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the snippet with the conflict unresolved as the intent and semantics are ambiguous without further context about the project's naming conventions or API requirements. Below is my reasoning followed by the unchanged snippet.

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics
- **HEAD version (`@Facebook private Likes likes;`)**: This side uses the `@Facebook` annotation without a specific field name, suggesting it maps to a default field name (likely `"likes"` in the API). The variable name `likes` indicates a straightforward representation of the "likes" data as an object or collection.
- **Other branch (`@Facebook("likes") private Likes likesList;`)**: This side explicitly specifies the field name `"likes"` in the annotation, which may imply a need to map to a specific API field. The variable name `likesList` suggests it might be intended as a list or collection of likes, potentially indicating a different structure or naming convention.
- **Ambiguity**: Without additional context about the `Likes` class (e.g., whether it represents a single entity or a collection) or the project's naming standards, it's unclear which naming (`likes` vs. `likesList`) or annotation style (`@Facebook` vs. `@Facebook("likes")`) is preferred. The semantic intent of both could be to represent the "likes" data for a Page, but the structural implications (single object vs. list) and annotation specificity are not evident.

Since the intent is ambiguous and I lack broader context about the API or codebase conventions, I will return the snippet with the conflict markers unchanged.
