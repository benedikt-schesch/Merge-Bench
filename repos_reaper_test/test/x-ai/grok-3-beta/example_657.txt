I'll return the snippet as provided since the merge conflict does not contain meaningful changes on the `HEAD` side to resolve semantically. The `HEAD` contains content (a `Map` import or variable), while the other side of the merge (`3e88fb2d7ef95f3cb7b5e2a771a0990c4a3a4a56`) appears to be empty or a deletion with no clear intent shown in the snippet. Without additional context or clarity on the purpose of the changes, I will preserve the original conflict.
