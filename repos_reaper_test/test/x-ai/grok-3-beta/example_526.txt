Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, presented in markdown code syntax. After the snippet, I will explain my analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict. Since the intent appears ambiguous or potentially redundant, I will not resolve the conflict at this stage but will provide reasoning for my decision.

```java
                        if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength){
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                            }      
                            builder.append(url);
<<<<<<< HEAD
                        } else if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength){
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[INFO] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI longer than " + maxUriLength + " characters. Skipping.");
                            }
                            builder.append(url);

### Analysis of Merge Conflict

**Context and Intent:**
- The code appears to handle the case where a data URI exceeds a specified maximum length (`maxUriLength`). If the length condition is met, it logs a message (if verbose mode is enabled) and appends the original URL to a `builder` instead of using the data URI.
- The conflict arises in a subsequent `else if` branch in the `HEAD` version, which seems to duplicate the same length check (`maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength`) as the preceding `if` block. This suggests a potential redundancy or oversight in the code structure.

**Semantics of Both Sides:**
- **HEAD (Left Side):** Adds an additional `else if` condition that repeats the same logic for checking the URI length. However, it changes the log message from `[WARNING]` to `[INFO]` and uses "characters" instead of "bytes" as the unit of measurement. It also appends the original `url` to the `builder` when the condition is met. This could imply an intent to distinguish between different contexts or units of measurement for the length (bytes vs. characters), but since the condition is identical to the preceding `if`, it will never be reached (as the `if` block will always execute first if the condition is true).
- **Right Side (Commit `cbc12a863399869d00e8dade047061bc441e7456`):** This side is empty in the conflict markers, suggesting that there is no additional `else if` block in this version. It likely continues directly to the `else` branch that follows.

**Ambiguity and Decision to Not Resolve:**
- The primary issue is that the `else if` condition in the `HEAD` version is redundant because it duplicates the check already performed in the preceding `if` block. This raises questions about the actual intent: Was the intent to handle a different condition (e.g., a different threshold or a different type of length check)? Or was it a mistake in copying or modifying the code?
- Additionally, the change from "bytes" to "characters" in the log message introduces potential semantic confusion. In programming, especially when dealing with URIs, "bytes" and "characters" are not always interchangeable due to encoding differences (e.g., UTF-8 encoding where a single character might be multiple bytes). Without further context or documentation about whether `uriString.length()` returns characters or bytes, I cannot confidently resolve this.
- The right side (empty conflict section) implies that this additional `else if` might not have existed in the other branch, suggesting that the `HEAD` change might be an accidental or incomplete modification.

**Conclusion:**
Given the redundancy of the condition in the `HEAD` version and the ambiguity around the intended semantics (e.g., purpose of "bytes" vs. "characters" and whether the condition was meant to be different), I am not resolving the conflict at this time. Resolving it prematurely could lead to incorrect assumptions about the developer's intent. Further context or clarification from the codebase or developers would be needed to determine whether the `else if` block in `HEAD` is a mistake, a placeholder for a different condition, or intended to handle a distinct case.

The original snippet with the conflict markers is returned unchanged as requested. If additional context or intent is provided, I can revisit this for resolution.
