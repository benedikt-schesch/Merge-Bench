Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, since the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge are ambiguous without additional context. I have included the full context as given, maintaining the original spacing and formatting.

package com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import android.app.ProgressDialog;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

>>>>>>> f977f63c0c0331b415e90b37d1c3b44ad214144b
import android.content.Intent;
import android.graphics.Bitmap;
import android.graphics.BitmapFactory;
import android.os.AsyncTask;
import android.os.Bundle;

```

**Reasoning for not resolving the conflict:**  
The merge conflict involves different import statements on each side. The `HEAD` side imports `android.app.ProgressDialog`, which suggests the code might be using a progress dialog to show loading states or user feedback. On the other hand, the `f977f63c` side imports `java.io.IOException` and `java.io.InputStream`, indicating potential involvement with I/O operations like reading streams, possibly for image or data processing.

Without additional context about the purpose of the class or the surrounding code, it is unclear whether one set of imports should take precedence over the other or if both are required. For instance, the class might need both a progress dialog (for user interaction) and I/O operations (for data handling). Alternatively, one side might be irrelevant due to refactoring or changes in implementation.

Since the intent and semantics cannot be confidently determined with the given snippet, I have preserved the conflict as is for manual resolution or further clarification. If additional context or code is provided, I can assist in resolving the conflict based on the specific requirements of the class.
