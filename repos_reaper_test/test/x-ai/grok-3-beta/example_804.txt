Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given, including the full context and spacing. I will also explain my analysis of the conflict and provide a resolution based on the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

```java
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(UnknownRowLockException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new UnknownRowLockException(null, null));
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(VersionMismatchException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new VersionMismatchException(null, null));
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(CallQueueTooBigException.REMOTE_CLASS,
<<<<<<< HEAD
            new CallQueueTooBigException(null, null));
=======
                               new CallQueueTooBigException(null, null));
>>>>>>> 4ba3d9e6a5cf1f6c0217777e9ce9ebff461cc270
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(UnknownProtocolException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new UnknownProtocolException(null, null));
  }

  /** We don't know the RPC protocol version of the server yet.  */
```

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict
Upon examining the merge conflict, the difference between the `HEAD` and the incoming branch (`4ba3d9e6a5cf1f6c0217777e9ce9ebff461cc270`) is purely a matter of indentation:
- **HEAD**: The line `new CallQueueTooBigException(null, null));` is indented with fewer spaces (aligned differently).
- **Incoming Branch (4ba3d9e6a5cf1f6c0217777e9ce9ebff461cc270)**: The same line is indented with more spaces to align with the pattern of the surrounding code (e.g., the previous `put` calls).

### Intent and Semantics
- Both sides of the merge are functionally identicalâ€”there is no difference in the actual code or behavior. The intent of both is to map the `CallQueueTooBigException.REMOTE_CLASS` to a new instance of `CallQueueTooBigException` with `null` parameters.
- The difference is purely stylistic, related to indentation. The incoming branch aligns the indentation consistently with the surrounding lines (using more spaces before `new CallQueueTooBigException(null, null));`), which improves readability and follows the pattern of the other `put` calls in the code.

### Resolution
Since the semantics and functionality are identical, the resolution should prioritize readability and consistency with the surrounding code. The incoming branch's indentation matches the pattern of the other lines (e.g., the alignment for `UnknownRowLockException`, `VersionMismatchException`, etc.), so I will adopt the indentation from the incoming branch.

Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict markers removed:

```java
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(UnknownRowLockException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new UnknownRowLockException(null, null));
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(VersionMismatchException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new VersionMismatchException(null, null));
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(CallQueueTooBigException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new CallQueueTooBigException(null, null));
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(UnknownProtocolException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new UnknownProtocolException(null, null));
  }

  /** We don't know the RPC protocol version of the server yet.  */
```

This resolution preserves the intent of both sides (mapping the exception class to an instance) while adopting the consistent indentation style from the incoming branch.
