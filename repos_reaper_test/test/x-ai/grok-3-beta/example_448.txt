Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given with all context, spacing, and formatting unchanged. Following the snippet, I will provide an analysis of the conflict and a resolution based on semantic intent.

```java
				"for a good prupose\n" + //
				"Watch this Girocode :-)"

		);
		assertNotNull(scheme);
<<<<<<< HEAD
		assertThat(scheme,instanceOf(Girocode.class));
=======
		assertThat(scheme, instanceOf(Girocode.class));
>>>>>>> 7d8e78a2b152062a876d6f8f0f8bde7550278ed0
		Girocode girocode = (Girocode) scheme;
		assertEquals(Encoding.UTF_8, girocode.getEncoding());
		assertEquals("DAAABCDGGD", girocode.getBic());
		assertEquals("Miss Marple", girocode.getName());
		assertEquals("DE91300776014444814989", girocode.getIban());
```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Conflict Overview:**
- The conflict lies in a single line of code where both sides are asserting that the `scheme` object is an instance of `Girocode.class` using `assertThat` from a testing framework (likely Hamcrest).
- The difference between the two versions is purely in formatting: one side has a space before `instanceOf` (`instanceOf`), while the other has a space after the comma (`instanceOf`).

**Semantic Intent:**
- Both sides of the merge have the same intent: to verify that `scheme` is an instance of the `Girocode` class.
- There is no functional or semantic difference between the two versions; the conflict is purely stylistic (spacing).

**Resolution Rationale:**
- Since the intent is identical, the resolution can adopt either version. However, for consistency with common Java coding conventions (like those in the Google Java Style Guide or typical IDE auto-formatting), a space after the comma is generally preferred for readability.
- I will adopt the version from the `7d8e78a2b152062a876d6f8f0f8bde7550278ed0` branch, which includes the space after the comma.

**Resolved Code Snippet:**

```java
				"for a good prupose\n" + //
				"Watch this Girocode :-)"

		);
		assertNotNull(scheme);
		assertThat(scheme, instanceOf(Girocode.class));
		Girocode girocode = (Girocode) scheme;
		assertEquals(Encoding.UTF_8, girocode.getEncoding());
		assertEquals("DAAABCDGGD", girocode.getBic());
		assertEquals("Miss Marple", girocode.getName());
		assertEquals("DE91300776014444814989", girocode.getIban());
```

This resolution maintains the semantic intent of both sides while applying a consistent and readable formatting style.
