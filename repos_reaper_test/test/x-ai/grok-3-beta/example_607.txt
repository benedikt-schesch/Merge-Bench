I'll return the snippet with the merge conflict as is, since the intent of the changes is ambiguous. The conflict involves the presence or absence of a `serialVersionUID` field, and without additional context or information about the serialization requirements or project conventions, it's unclear whether this field should be included or removed.

Here is the unchanged code snippet with the full context preserved:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class Engagement extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    /**
     * Number of people who like this.
     * 
     * @return Number of people who like this
     */
```

If you have additional context regarding whether serialization is needed for this class or the projectâ€™s guidelines on `serialVersionUID`, I can assist further in resolving the conflict.
