Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent behind the conditional check for `contentOffset` is ambiguous without further context. I will explain my reasoning after presenting the unchanged snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
    if (metadata != null) {
      content = new MultipartContent().setContentParts(Arrays.asList(metadata, mediaContent));
      initiationRequestUrl.put("uploadType", "multipart");
    } else {
      initiationRequestUrl.put("uploadType", "media");
<<<<<<< HEAD
      if (contentOffset != -1) {
        initiationRequestUrl.put("contentOffset", String.valueOf(contentOffset));
      }
=======
      initiationRequestUrl.put("contentOffset", String.valueOf(contentOffset));
>>>>>>> 2b9e9a2c04fcb8b3b93d3207f547f6f95bf681e9
    }
    HttpRequest request =
        requestFactory.buildRequest(initiationRequestMethod, initiationRequestUrl, content);
    request.getHeaders().putAll(initiationHeaders);
    // We do not have to do anything special here if media content length is unspecified because
```

### Reasoning:
- **Conflict Analysis**: The conflict arises in the handling of `contentOffset`. On the `HEAD` side, there is a conditional check `if (contentOffset != -1)` before setting the `contentOffset` value in the `initiationRequestUrl`. On the other branch (`2b9e9a2c04fcb8b3b93d3207f547f6p95bf681e9`), the `contentOffset` is set unconditionally.
- **Semantic Intent**: 
  - The `HEAD` branch likely intends to set `contentOffset` only when it has a valid, non-default value (assuming `-1` represents an invalid or unset offset).
  - The other branch (`2b9e9a2c04fcb8b3b93d3207f547f6p95bf681e9`) seems to assume that `contentOffset` should always be set, regardless of its value.
- **Ambiguity**: Without additional context about the expected behavior of `contentOffset` (e.g., whether `-1` is a meaningful value to send or not, or whether `contentOffset` is guaranteed to be set elsewhere), it is unclear which approach is correct. The decision depends on the semantics of the `contentOffset` field in the broader application logic (e.g., API requirements or intended upload behavior).
- **Conclusion**: Since the intent is ambiguous and resolving this conflict could lead to incorrect behavior (e.g., sending an invalid `contentOffset` or omitting a necessary value), I have preserved the conflict markers in the code snippet. A developer with domain knowledge or additional context about the `contentOffset` field should resolve this conflict by determining whether the conditional check is necessary or if the value should always be included.

If further context or clarification is provided, I can attempt a resolution based on the additional information.
