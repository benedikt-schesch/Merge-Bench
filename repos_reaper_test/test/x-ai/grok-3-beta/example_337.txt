Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context, spacing, and markdown syntax. I have not modified the context or resolved the conflict yet because I will first analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

```java
	}

	// Menu.
	@Override
	public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		MenuItem item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_REPLIES, 0, R.string.page_title_mentions);
		item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_revert);

		item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_DM, 0, R.string.page_title_direct_messages);
		item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_send);

>>>>>>> ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62
		return super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);
	}
	
	private int CONTEXT_DELETE_ID = getLastContextMenuId() + 1;
	
```

### Analysis of Intent and Semantics

- **HEAD Side (Left Side of Conflict):** The code on the `HEAD` side adds two menu items to the options menu:
  1. A menu item for "Mentions" with the ID `OPTIONS_MENU_ID_REPLIES` and an icon `ic_menu_revert`.
  2. A menu item for "Direct Messages" with the ID `OPTIONS_MENU_ID_DM` and an icon `ic_menu_send`.
  The intent here is clear: to populate the options menu with specific items related to mentions and direct messages, each with a distinct icon and title resource.

- **Other Side (Right Side of Conflict, Commit `ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62`):** The code on this side is empty between the conflict markers. This suggests that in this branch, no menu items were added to the `onCreateOptionsMenu` method, or the content was removed or not yet implemented. The intent here is ambiguous—it could mean that no menu items are needed, or it could be an incomplete implementation.

- **Semantic Merge Conflict Resolution:** Since the `HEAD` side provides a clear intent to add specific menu items while the other side provides no content or changes, the most logical resolution is to favor the `HEAD` side. This assumes that the empty content on the other branch is not intentional (i.e., not meant to remove menu items) but rather a lack of implementation or an oversight. If the intent of the other branch was to explicitly remove menu items, additional context or documentation would be required to confirm that, which is not provided in this snippet.

However, since I am required to return the snippet unresolved if the intent is ambiguous, and the empty content on the right side could potentially indicate an intentional omission, I will not resolve the conflict at this time. I recommend further discussion with the developers involved in the merge to clarify the intent of the branch represented by commit `ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62`—specifically, whether the absence of menu items was intentional.

Thus, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact as requested when the intent is not fully clear.

```java
	}

	// Menu.
	@Override
	public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		MenuItem item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_REPLIES, 0, R.string.page_title_mentions);
		item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_revert);

		item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_DM, 0, R.string.page_title_direct_messages);
		item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_send);
