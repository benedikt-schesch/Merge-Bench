I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the code snippet with the conflict resolved based on the semantic intent of both sides.

In this case, the merge conflict arises from an additional import statement for `POPackage` in one branch (`88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) that is not present in the `HEAD` branch. Semantically, it appears that the intent of the branch is to include an additional class from the same package for use in the codebase, which is a common and reasonable addition. The `HEAD` branch does not remove or conflict with this import; it simply lacks it. Therefore, the safest and most logical resolution is to include the additional import statement to ensure all necessary classes are available.

Here is the resolved snippet with the full context preserved as provided:
