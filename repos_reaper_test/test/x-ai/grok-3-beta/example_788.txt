I'll analyze this merge conflict with the intent and semantics of both sides in mind.

Looking at the conflict:
- **HEAD** includes `PUT` as the first parameter in the `super` call, along with `table`, `key`, `family`, `timestamp`, and `lockid`.
- **Incoming branch (d543609...)** omits `PUT` and only passes `table`, `key`, `family`, `timestamp`, and `lockid` to `super`.

**Intent Analysis**:
- The `HEAD` branch likely intends to specify the type of operation (`PUT`) explicitly in the superclass constructor, which might be required if the superclass differentiates behavior based on operation type.
- The incoming branch likely assumes the operation type is either handled differently (perhaps hardcoded or inferred) or the superclass constructor doesn't require this parameter, suggesting a structural change in the superclass.

**Resolution Challenge**:
- Without knowing the exact signature of the superclass constructor or the broader context of how operation types are handled, it's ambiguous whether `PUT` is necessary or obsolete.
- If the superclass constructor in the `HEAD` branch expects the operation type as a parameter, omitting it (as in the incoming branch) would cause a compilation error.
- Conversely, if the superclass constructor has changed in the incoming branch to not require the operation type, including `PUT` might cause an error.

**Decision**:
Since the intent is unclear without additional context (e.g., superclass definition, project conventions, or broader changes in the merge), I will preserve the conflict as is to avoid making an incorrect assumption. Resolving this would require understanding the superclass constructor signature or the intended behavior of the operation type.

Here is the original snippet unchanged with the merge conflict preserved:

```java
                     final byte[] family,
                     final byte[][] qualifiers,
                     final byte[][] values,
                     final long timestamp,
                     final long lockid) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    super(PUT, table, key, family, timestamp, lockid);
=======
    super(table, key, family, timestamp, lockid);
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    KeyValue.checkFamily(family);
    if (qualifiers.length != values.length) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Have " + qualifiers.length
        + " qualifiers and " + values.length + " values.  Should be equal.");
    } else if (qualifiers.length == 0) {

```
