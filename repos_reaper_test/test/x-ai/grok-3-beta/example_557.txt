I'll preserve the code snippet exactly as provided, including the merge conflict, since the intent behind the changes isn't entirely clear from the given context. The conflict appears to involve the presence or absence of the `serialVersionUID` field, but without additional information about why it was removed or whether it is still needed for serialization purposes, I cannot definitively resolve the conflict.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
/**
 * Represents the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/adcreative/">AdGroup Creative type</a>.
 */
public class AdCreative extends NamedAdsObject {

<<<<<<< HEAD
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  /**
   * The actor ID (Page ID) of this creative.
   *
   * This field is available only for mobile app ads created before 2015
   *
```

**Analysis of Intent (for clarity, though not altering the code):**
- **Left side (HEAD):** Includes `serialVersionUID`, which is typically used for serialization purposes in Java to ensure version compatibility of serialized objects. The intent might be to maintain serialization support for this class.
- **Right side (a17acec...):** Removes `serialVersionUID`, possibly indicating that serialization is no longer needed or that the field was deemed unnecessary. However, the intent behind the removal is unclear without further context.
- **Resolution Note:** If serialization is still required for `AdCreative`, the `serialVersionUID` should be kept. If serialization is no longer used or relevant, it can be safely removed. Since the context doesn't provide enough information to determine this, Iâ€™m leaving the conflict as is for manual resolution or further input.
