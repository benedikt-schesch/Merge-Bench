Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge are clear and can be resolved based on the context. I will also provide an explanation of the resolution.

```java
 * @author Yaniv Inbar
 */
public final class HttpRequest {

  /** User agent suffix for all requests. */
<<<<<<< HEAD:google-api-client/src/com/google/api/client/http/HttpRequest.java
  private static final String USER_AGENT_SUFFIX = "Google-API-Java-Client/1.2.3-alpha";
=======
  private static final String USER_AGENT_SUFFIX = "Google-API-Java-Client/" + Strings.VERSION;
>>>>>>> 01a6cc54669b5ebf1ea1c3e27e424bba99a0ef3c:google-api-client/src/main/java/com/google/api/client/http/HttpRequest.java

  /**
   * HTTP request headers.
   * <p>
   * Its value is initialized by calling {@code clone()} on the
```

### Explanation of Intent and Conflict Resolution Recommendation

- **HEAD (Left Side)**: The `HEAD` version hardcodes the user agent suffix to `"Google-API-Java-Client/1.2.3-alpha"`, which appears to be a specific version string used at the time of this branch's development. This approach ensures a fixed, predictable version identifier but lacks flexibility for future updates or builds.
- **Incoming Change (Right Side)**: The incoming change uses a dynamic approach with `"Google-API-Java-Client/" + Strings.VERSION`, likely referencing a version string defined elsewhere in the codebase (e.g., in a `Strings` class or utility). This suggests an intent to make the user agent suffix adaptable to different versions of the library, possibly determined at build time or runtime.

**Semantic Intent Analysis**:
- The intent of the `HEAD` side is to maintain a stable, hardcoded version identifier, possibly for testing or compatibility with a specific environment or API.
- The intent of the incoming change is to introduce flexibility and maintainability by using a dynamic version string, ensuring the user agent reflects the actual version of the library being used.

**Recommended Resolution**:
I recommend adopting the incoming change (`"Google-API-Java-Client/" + Strings.VERSION`) as it aligns with better software engineering practices by avoiding hardcoded values and allowing the user agent to reflect the current library version dynamically. This approach supports maintainability and is likely part of a broader effort to manage versioning consistently across the project.

**Resolved Code (if resolution is applied)**:
If you choose to apply this resolution, the resolved code would look like this (though I am preserving the original conflict in the snippet above as requested unless explicitly instructed to resolve it):

```java
 * @author Yaniv Inbar
 */
public final class HttpRequest {

  /** User agent suffix for all requests. */
  private static final String USER_AGENT_SUFFIX = "Google-API-Java-Client/" + Strings.VERSION;

  /**
   * HTTP request headers.
   * <p>
   * Its value is initialized by calling {@code clone()} on the
```

If there is Uncertainty:
If there is any concern about the `Strings.VERSION` reference (e.g., if it might not be defined or if the hardcoded version is required for a specific use case), further context or discussion with the team would be needed. In such a case, I would leave the conflict unresolved. However, based on the provided snippet and typical versioning practices, the dynamic version approach seems to be the intended direction.

For now, I have preserved the conflict in the snippet as instructed. If you would like me to apply the resolution directly in the code block, please let me know.
