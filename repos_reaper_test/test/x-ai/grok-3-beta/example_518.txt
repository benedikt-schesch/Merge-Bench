Below is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I will also provide an analysis of the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict to suggest a resolution.

```java
	TEXT(R.string.examplegroup_text,
			Example.TEXT, Example.TICKERTEXT, Example.CHANGEABLETEXT, Example.TEXTBREAK, Example.CUSTOMFONT, Example.STROKEFONT, Example.BITMAPFONT),
	AUDIO(R.string.examplegroup_audio, 
			Example.SOUND, Example.MUSIC, Example.MODPLAYER),
	ADVANCED(R.string.examplegroup_advanced, 
<<<<<<< HEAD
			Example.SPLITSCREEN, Example.BOUNDCAMERA, Example.SCRIPTING), // Example.AUGMENTEDREALITY, Example.AUGMENTEDREALITYHORIZON),
=======
			Example.SPLITSCREEN, Example.BOUNDCAMERA, Example.HULLALGORITHM), // Example.AUGMENTEDREALITY, Example.AUGMENTEDREALITYHORIZON),
>>>>>>> f6ad59da94ec434a5065bfc54ac9a207817bcb87
	POSTPROCESSING(R.string.examplegroup_postprocessing, 
			Example.MOTIONSTREAK, Example.RADIALBLUR),
	BACKGROUND(R.string.examplegroup_background, 
			Example.REPEATINGSPRITEBACKGROUND, Example.AUTOPARALLAXBACKGROUND, Example.TMXTILEDMAP),
	OTHER(R.string.examplegroup_other, 
```

### Analysis and Resolution Suggestion:
- **Context**: The code appears to be part of an enumeration or categorization of examples under different groups (e.g., `TEXT`, `AUDIO`, `ADVANCED`, etc.) in what seems to be a game development or graphics framework. Each group lists specific example features or functionalities.
- **Conflict Details**: The conflict is in the `ADVANCED` category. The `HEAD` version lists `Example.SCRIPTING` as the third item, while the `f6ad59da` branch lists `Example.HULLALGORITHM` in the same position. Both versions retain the same commented-out examples (`Example.AUGMENTEDREALITY`, `Example.AUGMENTEDREALITYHORIZON`), indicating that neither side intends to include these in the current list.
- **Intent and Semantics**:
  - **HEAD (SCRIPTING)**: Suggests a focus on scripting capabilities, likely related to custom logic or behavior programming in the advanced examples category. This fits well semantically with `ADVANCED` as scripting is often considered a complex or advanced feature.
  - **Branch f6ad59da (HULLALGORITHM)**: Suggests a focus on a convex hull algorithm or similar computational geometry technique. This also fits the `ADVANCED` category as it implies a sophisticated mathematical or algorithmic example.
  - Both sides maintain the commented-out AR-related examples, indicating a shared understanding that these are not currently active or relevant.
- **Ambiguity**: It is unclear whether the intent is to replace `SCRIPTING` with `HULLALGORITHM` or if both should be included. Neither side provides additional context to suggest that one supersedes the other, and both seem to be valid advanced examples.
- **Suggested Resolution**: Since both `SCRIPTING` and `HULLALGORITHM` are semantically appropriate for the `ADVANCED` category and there is no clear indication of exclusion, I recommend including both to preserve the intent of both contributors. This approach avoids data loss and assumes that both features are relevant examples to showcase under `ADVANCED`.

### Resolved Code Snippet (Suggested):
```java
	TEXT(R.string.examplegroup_text,
			Example.TEXT, Example.TICKERTEXT, Example.CHANGEABLETEXT, Example.TEXTBREAK, Example.CUSTOMFONT, Example.STROKEFONT, Example.BITMAPFONT),
	AUDIO(R.string.examplegroup_audio, 
			Example.SOUND, Example.MUSIC, Example.MODPLAYER),
	ADVANCED(R.string.examplegroup_advanced, 
			Example.SPLITSCREEN, Example.BOUNDCAMERA, Example.SCRIPTING, Example.HULLALGORITHM), // Example.AUGMENTEDREALITY, Example.AUGMENTEDREALITYHORIZON),
	POSTPROCESSING(R.string.examplegroup_postprocessing, 
			Example.MOTIONSTREAK, Example.RADIALBLUR),
	BACKGROUND(R.string.examplegroup_background, 
			Example.REPEATINGSPRITEBACKGROUND, Example.AUTOPARALLAXBACKGROUND, Example.TMXTILEDMAP),
	OTHER(R.string.examplegroup_other, 
```

### Final Note:
If the project maintainers or contributors have a specific policy on limiting the number of examples per category or if there is additional context (e.g., one of these features being deprecated or not fully implemented), the resolution may need adjustment. In such a case, I recommend consulting with the team to confirm whether `SCRIPTING`, `HULLALGORITHM`, or both should be included. For now, the suggested resolution prioritizes inclusivity to avoid losing either contribution.
