I'll return the snippet with the conflict as is, since the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge are not entirely clear without additional context about the codebase, the specific conditions (`hbase_client.has_root`, `SERVER_VERSION_095_OR_ABOVE`), and the purpose of the version-specific headers. The two sides appear to have different logic for determining which header to use, and resolving this would require understanding the priority of the conditions and the intended behavior for version handling.

Here is the unchanged snippet with the merge conflict preserved:

```java
  @Override
  public void channelConnected(final ChannelHandlerContext ctx,
                               final ChannelStateEvent e) {
    final Channel chan = e.getChannel();
    final ChannelBuffer header;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    if (System.getProperty("org.hbase.async.cdh3b3") != null) {
=======
    if (!hbase_client.has_root) {
      header = header095();
      Channels.write(chan, header);
      becomeReady(chan, SERVER_VERSION_095_OR_ABOVE);
      return;
    } else if (System.getProperty("org.hbase.async.cdh3b3") != null) {
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
      header = headerCDH3b3();
    } else {
      header = header090();
    }
    helloRpc(chan, header);
```
