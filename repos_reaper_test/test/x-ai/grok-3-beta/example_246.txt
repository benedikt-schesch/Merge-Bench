Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved as is, including the full context and original spacing. I have analyzed the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge conflict. The difference between the two versions appears to be purely stylistic, with one side having the `throws IOException` on the same line as the method declaration and the other side having it on a new line. Since there is no functional or semantic difference between the two, I will resolve the conflict by choosing a consistent formatting style (placing `throws IOException` on the same line as the method signature for brevity and readability, which aligns with common Java coding conventions).

Below is the resolved snippet with the conflict markers removed and the formatting adjusted accordingly:

```java
     * is based and merge it with the Conf supplied
     *
     * package level access so that this is not publicly used elsewhere
     * @throws IOException
     */
    static void mergeSplitSpecificConf(LoadFunc loadFunc, PigSplit pigSplit, Configuration originalConf) throws IOException {
        // set up conf with entries from input specific conf
        Job job = new Job(originalConf);
        loadFunc.setLocation(getLoadLocation(pigSplit.getInputIndex(),
                originalConf), job);
        // The above setLocation call could write to the conf within
```

### Explanation of Resolution:
- **Intent and Semantics**: Both sides of the merge conflict define the same method signature with identical functionality. The only difference is in the formatting of the `throws IOException` clause (line break vs. same line).
- **Resolution Choice**: I chose to place `throws IOException` on the same line as the method signature to follow a compact and widely accepted Java coding style, ensuring readability and consistency.
- **Preservation of Context**: The surrounding context, comments, and spacing have been preserved exactly as provided in the original snippet. Only the conflicting part has been resolved.
