I'll preserve the snippet exactly as provided and analyze the intent behind both sides of the merge conflict to resolve it semantically. Below is the unchanged code snippet with the conflict markers, followed by my analysis and resolution.

```java
    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        bind(IMavenConfiguration.class).toInstance(MavenPlugin.getMavenConfiguration());
        bind(PersistNonRuntimeClasspathConfigurer.class);
        bind(AddNonRuntimeClasspathContainerConfigurer.class);
<<<<<<< HEAD
        bind(IMaven.class).toInstance(MavenPlugin.getMaven());
        bind(BuildPathManager.class);
=======
        bind(RemoveNonRuntimeProjectsConfigurer.class);
>>>>>>> 4b0f0ad0ce6afc98a1fc78b9fe46584c41f478e8
    }

    @Provides
    List<RawClasspathConfigurer> provideRawClasspathConfigurers(PersistNonRuntimeClasspathConfigurer persistConfigurer,
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Analysis and Resolution

**Context and Intent Analysis:**
- The code appears to be part of a dependency injection configuration, likely using a framework like Guice, where bindings for various classes or interfaces are defined in the `configure()` method.
- **HEAD (Left Side):** This side includes two bindings:
  - `bind(IMaven.class).toInstance(MavenPlugin.getMaven());` - This binds the `IMaven` interface to a specific instance provided by `MavenPlugin.getMaven()`. The intent seems to be providing a concrete Maven implementation for dependency injection.
  - `bind(BuildPathManager.class);` - This binds the `BuildPathManager` class, likely for managing build paths in a Maven context, possibly as a singleton or for further configuration.
- **Other Branch (Right Side):** This side includes a single binding:
  - `bind(RemoveNonRuntimeProjectsConfigurer.class);` - This binds a configurer class likely responsible for removing non-runtime projects from the classpath. The intent appears to be extending or modifying classpath configuration behavior.
- Both sides are adding bindings to the dependency injection container, but they are doing so for different purposes. There is no direct overlap or conflict in terms of functionality (i.e., they are not binding the same class or interface to different implementations). Thus, the semantic intent of both sides can likely be preserved by combining the bindings.

**Resolution Decision:**
- Since the bindings do not conflict (they bind different classes/interfaces), the most logical resolution is to include all bindings from both sides to respect the intent of both changes.
- The resolved code should include `bind(IMaven.class).toInstance(MavenPlugin.getMaven());`, `bind(BuildPathManager.class);`, and `bind(RemoveNonRuntimeProjectsConfigurer.class);`.

**Resolved Snippet:**
```java
    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        bind(IMavenConfiguration.class).toInstance(MavenPlugin.getMavenConfiguration());
        bind(PersistNonRuntimeClasspathConfigurer.class);
        bind(AddNonRuntimeClasspathContainerConfigurer.class);
        bind(IMaven.class).toInstance(MavenPlugin.getMaven());
        bind(BuildPathManager.class);
        bind(RemoveNonRuntimeProjectsConfigurer.class);
    }

    @Provides
    List<RawClasspathConfigurer> provideRawClasspathConfigurers(PersistNonRuntimeClasspathConfigurer persistConfigurer,
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

**Note:** The second conflict marker at the end of the snippet remains unresolved as it appears incomplete in the provided context. If further context or the rest of the conflict is provided, I can assist with resolving that as well. For now, I've focused on resolving the first conflict in the `configure()` method based on the clear intent of both sides.
