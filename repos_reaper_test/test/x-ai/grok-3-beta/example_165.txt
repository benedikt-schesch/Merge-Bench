Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict preserved, as the intent behind the changes requires further clarification. Below, I will also explain my analysis of the conflict and why I have chosen not to resolve it at this point.

```java
        }
    }

    public static boolean fileExists(String filename, PigContext context)
            throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        return fileExists(filename, context.getDfs());
=======
        return fileExists(filename, context.getFs());
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }

    public static boolean fileExists(String filename, DataStorage store)
            throws IOException {
        ElementDescriptor elem = store.asElement(filename);
```

### Analysis of the Merge Conflict
The conflict arises in the `fileExists` method where one branch (HEAD) uses `context.getDfs()` to retrieve what is presumably a file system or data storage object, while the other branch (commit `1488b22`) uses `context.getFs()` for a seemingly similar purpose. The surrounding context shows an overloaded `fileExists` method that accepts a `DataStorage` parameter, indicating that the method is designed to work with some form of storage abstraction.

#### Possible Intents:
- **HEAD (context.getDfs())**: This might refer to a specific implementation or older naming convention for accessing a distributed file system (DFS). The intent could be to ensure compatibility with a specific storage backend or to use a more precise term for the storage system in use (e.g., Hadoop DFS).
- **Commit 1488b22 (context.getFs())**: This likely refers to a more general file system abstraction (`Fs` might stand for "FileSystem"). The intent could be to make the code more generic or to align with a newer or broader API that uses `Fs` as the naming convention.

#### Why the Conflict is Not Resolved:
The resolution depends on the broader context of the codebase, such as:
1. **API Consistency**: Which method (`getDfs()` or `getFs()`) is the correct or current way to access the file system/storage in the `PigContext` class? If `getFs()` is the newer or preferred method, the commit `1488b22` might be the correct choice. If `getDfs()` is still in use or serves a specific purpose, HEAD might be correct.
2. **Semantic Difference**: Are `getDfs()` and `getFs()` semantically identical, or do they refer to different types of storage systems? If they are different, choosing one over the other could change the behavior of the code.
3. **Deprecation or Refactoring**: One of these methods might be deprecated or part of a larger refactoring effort, which would influence the choice.

Without additional context about the `PigContext` class, the purpose of `getDfs()` vs. `getFs()`, or the project's coding standards, resolving this conflict risks introducing incorrect behavior. Therefore, I have preserved the conflict markers in the snippet as provided.

If further information is available (e.g., documentation, commit messages, or the definition of `PigContext`), I can assist in making a more informed resolution. For now, I recommend reviewing the intent behind the change in commit `1488b22` and the context of `getDfs()` versus `getFs()` to determine the appropriate method to use.
