Here is the resolved code snippet, incorporating the most appropriate version of the conflicting changes:

```java
			}

			if (!ambiguousPrincipals.isEmpty()) {

				final String title = "Ambiguous Principal(s)";
				final String text = "For the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for grants or node ownership during <b>deployment</b>."
						+ "<br>"
						+ "Because of this ambiguity, <b>node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported</b." 
						+ "<ul><li>" + ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>")) + "</li></ul>"
						+ "Consider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.";

				logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
						+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
						+ "\tThe identified ambiguous principal(s) could cause issues with deployment and access rights. Please address these ambiguities in the database.\n"
						+ "Affected names: " + ambiguousPrincipals.toString());
```

This resolution incorporates the refined text and improved logging, maintaining the most relevant and complete changes from the conflicting branches.
