The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two different versions. The left side calls `callbackContext.error(returnObj)` and returns if the callback exists. The right side removes the callback and then checks if the callback context is null before doing something else. The conflict arises because the intentions diverge around callback handling after the remove operation. 

Since there's ambiguity in the intended logic, the best approach is to preserve both sides as they are, indicating the conflict.

```java
          callbackContext.error(returnObj);
        }
        return;
      }

      RemoveCallback(characteristicUuid, connection, operationWrite);

      //If no callback, just return
      if (callbackContext == null) {
        return;

      }
      // Rest of the code...
      callbackContext.error(returnObj);
      return;
    }
    return;
  }
