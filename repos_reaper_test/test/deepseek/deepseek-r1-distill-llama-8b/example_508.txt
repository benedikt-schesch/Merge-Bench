To resolve the merge conflict, the key is to determine which resource (`mBitmapTexture` or `mBitmapTextureAtlas`) should be used. The context suggests that the `mBitmapTextureAtlas` is the correct choice, likely for better texture management.

```java
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
				this.draw(faceSprite2);
			}
		};
		
		// Using mBitmapTextureAtlas, which is the correct choice
		final SpriteBatch staticSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, 2);
		staticSpriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, -50, 0, this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth(), this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight(), 2, 2);
		staticSpriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, 50, 0, this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth(), this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight(), 45);
		staticSpriteBatch.submit();

		dynamicSpriteBatch.setPosition(centerX, centerY - 50);
```
