To resolve the merge conflict, we need to address the duplicate `addHeader` method in both code snippets. Since both branches contain the same method, we can only keep one of them. Selecting one to keep based on which branch should take precedence, typically the latest change.

The conflicting code is as follows:

```java
public MockLowLevelHttpRequest(String url) {
    this.url = url;
}

@Override
public void addHeader(String name, String value) {
    headers.put(name, value);
}

@Override
public LowLevelHttpResponse execute() throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpResponse();
}

public MockLowLevelHttpRequest(String url) {
    this.url = url;
}

public void addHeader(String name, String value) {
    headers.put(name, value);
}

public LowLevelHttpResponse execute() throws IOException {
    return new MockLevelHttpResponse();
}
```

<= The conflict is between the same method definitions of `addHeader` and `execute()` on both branches. The user should choose which version to keep based on language version compatibility, testing requirements, or additional changes introduced in the respective commits. If neither version carries critical features or fixes, it's typical to prefer the most recent implementation, here from the latter branch (`f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b`). If a specific version is needed, the user should merge only the differences between the files rather than the entire snippets. <=

```java
public MockLowLevelHttpRequest(String url) {
    this.url = url;
}

@Override
public void addHeader(String name, String value) {
    headers.put(name, value);
}

@Override
public LowLevelHttpResponse execute() throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpResponse();
}

public MockLowLevelHttpRequest(String url) {
    this.url = url;
}

public void addHeader(String name, String value) {
    headers.put(name, value);
}

public LowLevelHttpResponse execute() throws IOException {
    return new MockLevelHttpResponse();
}
```
