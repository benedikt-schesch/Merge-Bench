The merge conflict is resolved by including all the necessary elements: the `serialVersionUID` and the fields with their `@Facebook` annotations. Both are important for serialization and marking the fields for processing, respectively.

```java

  }

  class DebugTokenError extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

=======
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    @Facebook
    private Integer code;

    @Facebook
    private String message;
