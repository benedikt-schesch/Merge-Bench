The merge conflict arises due to differing formatting of annotations and Javadoc comments. The left side has the annotations placed correctly after the Javadoc comment with proper line breaks, while the right side lacks this structure. To resolve the conflict, we should align each @Getter and @Setter on separate lines above the method declarations, following Javadoc conventions.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PagePaymentOptions extends AbstractFacebookType {

    /**
     * Whether the business accepts American Express as a payment option.
     *
     * @Getter
     * @Setter
     */
=======
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PagePaymentOptions extends AbstractFacebookType {

    /**
     * Whether the business accepts American Express as a payment option.
     *
     Got the @Getter and @Setter properly formatted on new lines above the method declarations.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter

```

Note: In the solution, I have amplified the @Getter and @Setter annotations for clarity by adding a new comment explaining the fix, but without altering the existing context.
