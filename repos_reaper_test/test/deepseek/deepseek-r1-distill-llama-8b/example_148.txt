The code on the right side seems to be the result of a merge conflict where the developer intended to conditionally initialize `ScriptState` without overwriting it if it's already present. The change removed `PigStats.start()` from the left side, so the final snippet will be the one from the right side.

```java
        addJarsFromProperties();
        markPredeployedJarsFromProperties();

        if (ScriptState.get() == null) {
            // If Pig was started via command line, ScriptState should have been
            // already initialized in Main. If so, we should not overwrite it.
            ScriptState.start(pigContext.getExecutionEngine().instantiateScriptState());
        }
```
