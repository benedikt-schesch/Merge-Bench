The code is experiencing a merge conflict due to a misplaced comment block and the introduction of a new method. The original version incorrectly places the comment after the return statement, while the merged version includes the method with its comments in the correct location. The correct resolution involves placing the comment above the `isGetRequest` method and ensuring the method is properly added after the return statement.

The final merged code, preserving the semantically correct structure, is as follows:

```java
    final GetRequest rpc = new GetRequest(0F, table, key);
    rpc.family(family);
    return rpc;
  }

  /**
   * Specifies a particular column family to get.
   * @param family The column family.
   * <strong>This byte array will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @return {@code this}, always.
   */
  private boolean isGetRequest() {
    return (versions & EXIST_FLAG) == 0;
  }
```
