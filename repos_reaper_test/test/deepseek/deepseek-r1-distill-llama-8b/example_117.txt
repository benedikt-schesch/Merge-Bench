The code snippet shows a merge conflict where two different changes are proposed for assigning the `branch` field of `repoInfo`. The left side of the merge attempts to set it to the current branch's name, while the right side attempts to set it to the commit SHA.

Since the intent behind the changes isn't clear or is ambiguous, it's appropriate to include both proposed changes as they might represent different approaches to solving the same problem.

```java
  private void openCommits() {
    if (selectedBranch != null) {
      RepoInfo repoInfo = new RepoInfo();
      repoInfo.owner = repo.getOwner().getLogin();
      repoInfo.name = repo.name;
<<<<<<< HEAD
      repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getName();
=======
      repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getName();
      // vs.
      repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getCommit().getSha();

      Intent intent = BranchCommitsActivity.createLauncherIntent(this, repoInfo);
      startActivity(intent);
    }
  }
```
