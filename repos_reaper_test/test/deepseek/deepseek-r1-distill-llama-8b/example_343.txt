To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine which version to keep based on the intent.

The method is declared as protected in HEAD and public in the other branch. Since the second version includes a more detailed implementation with try-catch and mUrl check, it appears to have been intentionally changed, likely to make the method public for external use.

```java
	 *            Parameters
	 * @param manager
	 *            Reference back to business layer
	 * @return Parsed JSON object, empty object on error.
	 */
	public JsonNode query(String command, JsonNode parameters,
			INotifiableManager manager) {
		throw new RuntimeException("Obsolete, remove any calls from this.");

		try {
			final ObjectMapper mapper = Client.MAPPER;

			if (mUrl == null) {
				throw new NoSettingsException();
