The provided snippet shows a code block with a merge conflict between two versions. The visitMapLookUp method has a TODO comment, and there's a conflict around the closing brace, possibly indicating additional code added in one version but not the other. The visitCast method is also present with a TODO but doesn't have a conflict marker, so it's considered resolved.

```java
        //do nothing
    }

    public void visitMapLookUp(POMapLookUp mapLookUp) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub

    }

    public void visitCast(POCast cast) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    }
