The code shows a potential merge conflict where both sides introduce different changes. Side 1 adds a log statement and a header constant, while Side 2 adds three new list variables.

To resolve the conflict:
- Keep the log statement and the header constant from Side 1.
- Add the new variables from Side 2.

```java
    // currently counters are not working in local mode - see PIG-1286
    public static final String SUCCESS_HEADER_LOCAL = "JobId\tAlias\tFeature\tOutputs";
    
    private static final Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(MRJobStats.class);
    
    private List<POStore> mapStores = null;
    private List<POStore> reduceStores = null;
    private List<FileSpec> loads = null;
```
