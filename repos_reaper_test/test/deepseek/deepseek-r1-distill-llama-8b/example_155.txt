To resolve the semantic merge conflict, the line with `myPig` should be kept as it likely provides necessary context, while the older line is removed to avoid duplication and potential errors.

```java
                        + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                        + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                        + "describe b;"
                        + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();

```
