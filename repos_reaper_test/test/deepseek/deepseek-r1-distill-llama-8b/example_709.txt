To resolve the merge conflict, we need to decide which changes to keep. The left side has `fetchPlaylists()`, `fetchLovedItemsPlaylist()`, and `fetchStarredAlbums()` commented out, while the right side includes a comprehensive `fetchAll()`. The comment suggests the left code was specific, but the right's `fetchAll()` likely better suits the workflow. Additionally, the `registerReceiver` lines are added on the right, indicating they should stay. Thus, we'll keep the right side's changes, including the new receivers. 

```java
        addCollection(new UserCollection());
        addCollection(new HatchetCollection());

        ensureLovedItemsPlaylist();
        updatePlaylists();
        fetchAll();
        fetchStarredAlbums();
        fetchStarredArtists();

        TomahawkApp.getContext().registerReceiver(mCollectionManagerReceiver,
                new IntentFilter(InfoSystem.INFOSYSTEM_RESULTSREPORTED));
        TomahawkApp.getContext().registerReceiver(mCollectionManagerReceiver,
                new IntentFilter(InfoSystem.INFOSYSTEM_OPLOGISEMPTIED));
```
