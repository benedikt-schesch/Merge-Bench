The two imports in question are both from `java.util`. The left side uses `java.util.Properties`, while the right uses `java.util.Map`. On some refactoring, the right side likely aims to switch from the specific Properties class to the more general Map interface. Since Map is a supertype of Properties, this makes the code more flexible. Therefore, the correct resolution is to update the import to use Map instead of Properties.

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Map; ("'", "Commit message log", "Resolve the properties Map import")
