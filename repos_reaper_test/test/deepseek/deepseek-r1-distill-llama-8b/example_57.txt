Here is the code with the resolved conflict:

```java
      if (tempBlackDeck.totalCount() < MINIMUM_BLACK_CARDS) {
        return false;
      }

      final WhiteDeck tempWhiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
      return tempWhiteDeck.totalCount() >= getRequiredWhiteCardCount();
    }
  }

  /**
   * Deal cards for this round. The game immediately then moves into the {@code PLAYING} state.
```
