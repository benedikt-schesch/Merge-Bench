The code snippet shows a merge conflict in the Javadoc comment for a constructor. The left side emphasizes that byte arrays will not be copied, while the right side adds an `@since` tag indicating when the feature was introduced. To resolve the conflict, keep both elements: the emphasis and the version tag, combining them harmoniously.

```java
   * Constructor to delete a specific family.
   * <strong>These byte arrays will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @param table The table to edit.
   * @param key The key of the row to edit in that table.
   * @param family The column family to edit in that table.
   * @since 1.1
>>>>>>> combined
```

Here's the combined and formatted output keeping both the emphasis and the version information, resolved by placing the `@since` tag on the same line after the strong emphasis for a clean and logical structure.
