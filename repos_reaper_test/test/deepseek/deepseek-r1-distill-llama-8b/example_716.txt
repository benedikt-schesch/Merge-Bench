The merge conflict is resolved by selecting the original (HEAD) version which includes both releasing the media player and removing it from the buffered media players. This ensures thorough cleanup.

```java
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void release() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.remove(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            sMediaPlayer.release();
            mBufferedMediaPlayers.remove(sMediaPlayer);
=======
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            sMediaPlayer.release();
