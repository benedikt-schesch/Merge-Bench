The code shows a merge conflict between two approaches for handling string arguments in a Java method. The left side uses `StringBuilder` for efficiency and initializes it regardless of whether there are arguments, which might not be optimal. The right side uses `StringBuffer` but attempts to check if there are arguments before processing, though it misses a type in the array declaration, which could cause a compilation error. To resolve, I'll choose the left side as it's more efficient and correct the right side's code to include the array type.

Here's the resolved code:  

```java
            return;

        case STRING: {
            // Gather up all the remaining arguments into a string and pass them into
            // grunt.
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            String[] remainders = opts.getRemainingArgs();
            for (int i = 0; i < remainders.length; i++) {
                if (i != 0) sb.append(' ');
                sb.append(remainders[i]);
            }
```
