The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict where two versions of the same line of code have been modified. The left side initializes `batched_rpcs` with a `server_version` parameter, while the right side does not. Since the right side's change is more recent and is intended to simplify the initialization, it should replace the left side.

```java
      if (batch.size() < 1024) {  // XXX Don't hardcode.
        batch = null;  // We're going to buffer this edit for now.
      } else {
        // Execute the edits buffered so far.  But first we must clear
        // the reference to the buffer we're about to send to HBase.
