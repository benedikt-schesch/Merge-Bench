The conflict involves two sets of imports, one from HEAD and another from the=YES. Both sets are not causing a direct syntax error but may require organizing into a single, complete import list. I'll combine them to include all necessary imports.

```java
import org.hbase.async.KeyValue;
import org.hbase.async.PutRequest;
import org.hbase.async.RowLock;
import org.hbase.async.RowLockRequest;
import org.hbase.async.Scanner;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.hbase.async.test.Common;
```
