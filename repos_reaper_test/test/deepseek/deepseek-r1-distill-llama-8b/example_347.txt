The provided code snippet is part of a test method that appears to be verifying the outcome of certain operations, possibly related to UPnP metadata handling. The exposure seems to check the `renderingControlLastChange` value before and after some operation (`mp.setMute(true)` followed by a sleep) and sets `lastChangeExpected` to a specific XML string.

The specific merge conflict occurs in the XML namespace declaration. The left side code snippet shows:
`<Event xmlns=\"urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0/RCS/\">`
  
The right side code snippet shows:
`<Event xmlns=\"urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0//RCS/\">`

The key difference is an extra double slash "//" in the right side namespace. The correct namespace should use a single slash.

Given the context, both branches appear to be trying to set `lastChangeExpected` to the same expected XML string after minor modifications, and the main difference is that typo in the namespace. Assuming the left side is correct, the right side's extra slash should be removed to match.

### Required resolution:
To fix the conflict, the right branch should have its namespace declaration corrected from `urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0//RCS/` to `urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0/RCS/`.

```java
        assertEquals(renderingControlLastChange.toString(), "");
        mp.setMute(true);
        Thread.sleep(500);
        lastChangeExpected =
