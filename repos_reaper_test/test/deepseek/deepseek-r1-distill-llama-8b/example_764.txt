To resolve the merge conflict, the comment on the right side adds clarity. It explains that after acquiring the lock on `ctx`, checking if the pipeline is still present indicates the first attempt to send a message. I'll include this comment to enhance code understanding.

```java
                                 final ChannelEvent event) {
      if (event instanceof MessageEvent) {
        synchronized (ctx) {
          final ChannelPipeline pipeline = ctx.getPipeline();

<<<<<<< HEAD
          if (pipeline.get(SayHelloFirstRpc.class) == this) {
            final MessageEvent me = (MessageEvent) event;
            final ChannelBuffer payload = (ChannelBuffer) me.getMessage();
            final ChannelBuffer header = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(HELLO_HEADER);
            final RegionClient client = pipeline.get(RegionClient.class);
=======
          // After acquiring the lock on `ctx', if we're still in the pipeline
          // it means that no message has been sent downstream yet, we're the
          // first one to attempt to send something.
          if (pipeline.get(SayHelloFirstRpc.class) == this) {
            final MessageEvent me = (MessageEvent) event;
            final ChannelBuffer payload = (ChannelBuffer) me.getMessage();
            final ChannelBuffer header = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(HELLO_HEADER);
            final RegionClient client = pipeline.get(RegionClient.class);
