To resolve the merge conflict, I will incorporate the changes from both sides while maintaining the Facebook annotations and appropriate field names. This aligns the code with Facebook's Open Graph properties.

```java
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  private String order;

  @Facebook("comment_order")
  private String openGraphCommentOrder;

  @Facebook("can_comment")
  private Boolean openGraphCanComment;
  
  @Facebook("can_comment")
  private Boolean canComment;

  
```
