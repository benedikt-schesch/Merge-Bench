The snippet shows a merge conflict between two sets of static string constants. The`
<<<<<<< HEAD
` side contains constants related to user preferences (`PREFS_USER_KEY`, `PREFS_PASSWORD_KEY`) and palette visibility (`PALETTE_VISIBILITY`). The`
=======
` side introduces a new constant `LIBRARY_UPDATED_ACTION`, which is likely related to a library update feature. This conflict arises because both changes are made on the same line, requiring proper merging.

The intent here is to maintain the existing constants while adding the new one. Since the new constant isn't directly related to the existing preferences or palette visibility, it should be added after the existing constants without modifying them.
