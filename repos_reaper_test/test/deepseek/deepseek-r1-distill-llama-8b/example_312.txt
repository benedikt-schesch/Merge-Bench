Since this appears to involve a refactoring of variable naming conventions and possibly a dependency update, it's likely that the new code (right) is the accurate representation. The key changes are:

1. `mApi` is now `TwitterApi` instead of `Weibo`
2. A new variable `nApi` introduced as the `Weibo` implementation
3. `mDb` has been renamed to `mDb2` as the `DatabaseHelper`

To resolve this conflict, we'll adopt the new variable names while preserving the correct types.

```java
  public static final String TAG = "TwitterApplication";
  
  public static ImageManager mImageManager;
  public static TwitterDbAdapter mDb; 
  public static TwitterApi mApi;
  public static Weibo nApi; // new API
  public static DatabaseHelper mDb2;

```

This maintains the intended changes while resolving the variable name conflicts.
