The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict where the method name and some lines have changes. The key issues are a method name typo and possibly the order of method calls. The main points to resolve are:

1. Correct the method name typo from `prepateCore` to `prepareCore`.
2. Ensure the method body includes all necessary lines for the test logic.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
	@Test
	public void shouldUpdateCoreOnAutoBuild() throws CoreException {
		InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 10);
		verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));
		assertStatusIs(findingTests(0, projects.size(), 0));
	}
```

The changes make the method name consistent, correct the typo, and keep the necessary method calls in a logical order.
