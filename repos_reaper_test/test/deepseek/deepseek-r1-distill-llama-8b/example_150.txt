The merge conflict arises because the code differs in how the `GruntParser` is initialized and the additional settings are applied. The right side adds `myPig` as a parameter and includes extra settings. The solution is to merge these changes.

```java
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```
