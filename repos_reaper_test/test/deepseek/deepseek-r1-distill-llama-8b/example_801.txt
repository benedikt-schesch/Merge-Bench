To resolve the merge conflict, I need to determine which change should take precedence based on the desired functionality.

Both sides are modifying the same lines and have conflicting code. The left side sets the server version and uses helloRpc. The right side doesn't set the version but also uses helloRpc. To ensure correct functionality, the left side's version setting is important and should be merged. The version should be preserved, so the `hbase_client.server_version = server_version;` line is correct. The right side's code under the same hash doesn't set the version and may have been a mistake.
```java
          // If we get here, it's because we tried to handshake with a server
          // running HBase 0.92 or above, but using a pre-0.92 handshake.  So
          // we know we have to handshake differently.
          server_version = SERVER_VERSION_092_OR_ABOVE;
          hbase_client.server_version = server_version;
          helloRpc(chan, header092());
        } else {
          // We get here if the server refused our 0.92-style handshake.  This
          // must be a future version of HBase that broke compatibility again,
          // and we don't know how to talk to it, so give up here.
```
