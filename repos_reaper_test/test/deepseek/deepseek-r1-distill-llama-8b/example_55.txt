To resolve the merge conflict, I need to understand the intent behind the changes. The modifications involve moving lines into an else block after a condition. Without the full context, it's unclear whether these actions should be conditional or always executed. Therefore, I will return the snippet as is with the conflict marked.

```java
        synchronized (options.cardSetIds) {
          cardSets = loadCardSets(session);
          blackDeck = loadBlackDeck(cardSets);
          whiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
        }
<<<<<<< HEAD
        metrics.gameStart(currentUniqueId, cardSets, options.blanksInDeck, options.playerLimit,
            options.scoreGoal, !StringUtils.isBlank(options.password));
        startNextRound();
        gameManager.broadcastGameListRefresh();
