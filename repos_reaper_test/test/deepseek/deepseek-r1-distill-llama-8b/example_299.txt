The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two sets of imports. The left side imports `Instantiator`, while the right side imports several other classes from different packages. To resolve this, we should include all necessary imports from both sides.

```java
import br.com.caelum.iogi.Instantiator;
import br.com.caelum.iogi.spi DependencyProvider;
import br.com.caelum.iogi.spi ParameterNamesProvider;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.Convert;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.Converter;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.Intercepts;
```
