The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict where two different sets of constant assignments are conflicting. The conflict is in the lines defining `ALARM_GET_SUPPORTED` and `ALARM_SUPPORTED_REPORT`. On one side, these constants are assigned 0x06 and 0x07, while on the other side, they are assigned 0x07 and 0x08. Without additional context on how these constants are used, the intent behind the changes is ambiguous. Therefore, it's unclear which change is more appropriate or if they can be merged without conflict.

Return the same snippet with the conflict marked as unresolved:
