The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two different imports and to-be-resolved. The left side has `SpoutServer` imported, but the right side declares `SpoutServerWorld`. The constant `WORLD_VERSION` is on the left, but the right does not have it. To resolve, we need to satisfy both, but the left's imports and constant should be retained unless they are outdated.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
import org.spout.engine.SpoutServer;
import org.spout.nbt.stream.NBTInputStream;
import org.spout.nbt.stream.NBTOutputStream;
import org.spout.nbt.util.NBTMapper;
import org.spout.engine.world.SpoutServerWorld;

public class WorldFiles {

	public static final byte WORLD_VERSION = 2;
	
}
```
