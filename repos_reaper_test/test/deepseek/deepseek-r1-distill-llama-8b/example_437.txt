I'm not entirely sure how you want me to proceed with resolving the merge conflict in the provided code snippet, but I notice there's a difference between the two versions:

1. **Left side (<<<<<<< HEAD):**
```java
refreshSubCategories();
```

2. **Right side (>>>>>>> 308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5):**
```java
rebuildSubCategories();
```

The code is trying to call different methods after showing the toast. The intended behavior might be to rebuild a set of subcategories, but the choice between `refreshSubCategories()` and `rebuildSubCategories()` could be semantically different. For example, `refreshSubCategories()` might just update existing data, while `rebuildSubCategories()` might create a completely new set of subcategories.

If you want to decide the correct method to use or if there's a specific logic that needs to be followed, let me know, and I can help you resolve the merge conflict accordingly.

Here's the entire code snippet with the conflict:

```java
                        if (getActivity() == null) return;

                        Toast.makeText(getActivity(), getString(R.string.update_complete),
                                Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();

<<<<<<< HEAD
                        refreshSubCategories();
=======
                        rebuildSubCategories();
>>>>>>> 308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5

                        reloadAdapters();
>>>>>>> 308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5

                        updateRecommendations();
                    }

                    @Override
```
