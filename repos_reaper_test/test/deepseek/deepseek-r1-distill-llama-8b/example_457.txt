The merge conflict arises because both branches are trying to modify the imports. One added `FileUtils`, and another may have had different or no imports. The developer's intent is to add functionality using `FileUtils`. Therefore, the import is necessary and should be incorporated in the winning branch.

To resolve the conflict, add the `FileUtils` import and remove the placeholder comment. Use unified diff syntax to show the change clearly.

```diff
 import javax.annotation.Nonnull;
 import javax.annotation.Nullable;
 import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
 import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
+import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;

```
