To resolve the merge conflict, I'll keep both sides and add a type cast to ensure the arguments are properly passed. This accommodates both intentions by making the code more explicit without altering the function's logic.

```java
                for (int i = 0; i < paramTypes.length; i++) {
                    paramTypes[i] = String.class;
                }
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(paramTypes);
                ret =  c.newInstance((Object[])args);
            } else {
                ret = objClass.newInstance();
            }
```
