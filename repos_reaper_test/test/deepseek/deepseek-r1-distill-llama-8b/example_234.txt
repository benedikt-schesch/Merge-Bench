The code snippet shows a merge conflict where two different changes were made to the class: the declaration of the 'end' variable (long in both cases) and the addition of the 'mTupleFactory' variable in one version. To resolve this, the correct approach is to keep the 'end' variable as declared in one version and add the 'mTupleFactory' in the other, avoiding duplication.

The resolved code should have 'end' declared once and 'mTupleFactory' added after, as the latter is a new variable.

```java
 * contains the line of text.
 */
public class TextLoader implements LoadFunc{
    BufferedPositionedInputStream in;
    final private static Charset utf8 = Charset.forName("UTF8");
    long end;
    private TupleFactory mTupleFactory = TupleFactory.getInstance();
