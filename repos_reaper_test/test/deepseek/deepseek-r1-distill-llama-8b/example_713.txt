The code shows a merge conflict in the play() method. 

On the left (HEAD), the method directly checks if the media player exists and is not playing before starting it. On the right (ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66), the method sets the play state and then calls handlePlayState(), which may handle the actual playing logic.

To combine them, we can set the play state first and then check if the player needs to be started. This captures both the state update and the media playback action.

```java
        EventBus.getDefault().register(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void play() {
        mPlayState = PlaybackStateCompat.STATE_PLAYING;
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null && !sMediaPlayer.isPlaying())
            sMediaPlayer.start();
    }

    @Override
    public void pause() {

        ...
    }
```
