To resolve the merge conflict, both lines should be included within the same `try` block to handle potential exceptions during their execution. This ensures that any issues with either the sound or texture loading are captured by the same catch block.

```java
		try {
			this.mExplosionSound = SoundFactory.createSoundFromAsset(this.mEngine.getSoundManager(), this, "explosion.ogg");
			this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}
