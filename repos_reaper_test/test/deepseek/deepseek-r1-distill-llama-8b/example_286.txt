To resolve the merge conflict, it's important to understand the intent behind each change. If both `useDefaultBag` and `keyWritable` represent different features or configurations that should coexist, they should both be included. If one is a replacement for the other, the more essential or current feature should be retained.

Final code after resolution:
```java
    private boolean useDefaultBag = false;
    private PigNullableWritable keyWritable;

    public POPackage(OperatorKey k) {
        this(k, -1, null);
    }
```
