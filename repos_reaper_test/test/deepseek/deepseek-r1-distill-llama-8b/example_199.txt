The provided code is part of a git merge conflict where two different versions of the same file have conflicting changes. The task is to resolve the conflict by combining the changes while maintaining the intent of both sides.

In this case:
- The left side has three private variables: `executionEngine`, `jobOutputFile`, and `jobConf`.
- The right side introduces a `properties` field with a corresponding JavaDoc comment.
- There's also a discrepancy in the presence of Pig Script Output.

To resolve the conflict:
1. Combine both sets of private variables.
2. Preserve the `transient` modifier for `executionEngine` since it appears on both sides.
3. Preserve the `properties` field and its comment from the right side.
4. Maintain the existing fields from the left side (e.g., `jobOutputFile` and `jobConf`).

The resolved code includes all the fields from both sides, ensuring that the context and functionality are preserved.

```java
    // handle to the back-end
    transient private ExecutionEngine executionEngine;
    
    private String jobName = JOB_NAME_PREFIX;    // can be overwritten by users
  
    // Pig Script Output
    private String jobOutputFile = "";
    
    // JobConf of the currently executing Map-Reduce job
    JobConf jobConf;
    
    /**
     * A table mapping function names to function specs.
     */
    private Properties properties;
```
