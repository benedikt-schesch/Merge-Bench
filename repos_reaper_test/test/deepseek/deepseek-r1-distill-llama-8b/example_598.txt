Conflicting sections merged:

- The initial merge conflict resulted in duplicated code. The correct approach would be to merge by taking the `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@Facebook`, and `private Boolean catering;` from one branch and the `@since` annotation from the other, while moving `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;` to follow the `@Facebook` annotation. If the original file had only the `@since` before the `serialVersionUID`, it's better to place it before.
