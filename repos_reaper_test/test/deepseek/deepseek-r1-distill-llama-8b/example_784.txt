The code snippet shows a conflict in the value of the `MAX_BYTE_ARRAY_MASK` constant and its accompanying comment. The left side defines it as `0xFFFFFFFFE0000000L` which corresponds to 512MB, while the right side defines it as `0xFFFFFFFFF0000000L` which is 256MB. The comment on the right side indicates the max is 256MB, suggesting the value was reduced to prevent potential issues. Assuming the change was intentional to conserve memory, the right side's version should be retained.

```java
  * undetected corruption of an RPC on the network, which would turn a
  * an innocuous RPC into something allocating a ton of memory.
  * The Hadoop RPC protocol doesn't do any checksumming as they probably
  * assumed that TCP checksums would be sufficient (they're not).
