The merged code should include both the original `fromPaginated` declaration and the new code added by the merge, ensuring the new functionality is included while preserving the original code.

```java
    private boolean fromPaginated;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        loadArguments();
        if (autoStart()) {
            executeRequest();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreateView(inflater, container, savedInstanceState);
```
