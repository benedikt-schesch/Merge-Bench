To resolve the merge conflict, we should ensure that both `retPos` and `newPos` are correctly initialized to the current position of the stream. The new version correctly sets both variables to `zStream.tell()`, aligning their initial values. This ensures consistency in tracking the position of the stream.

```java
    // and we set retPos to newPos once we have read a character from that block.
    // see getPos() for more detail
    private long retPos, newPos = -1;

    public CBZip2InputStream(SeekableInputStream zStream, int blockSize) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        retPos = oldPos = zStream.tell();
=======
        retPos = newPos = zStream.tell();

    	ll8 = null;
        tt = null;
        checkComputedCombinedCRC = blockSize == -1;
        bsSetStream(zStream);
        initialize(blockSize);
```
