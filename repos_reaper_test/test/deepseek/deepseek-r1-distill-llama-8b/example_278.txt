The provided code snippet appears to contain a merge conflict. This is likely due to a change in the codebase where two different versions of this method have been conflicting during a Git merge. 

The goal here is to return the entire snippet as provided, while preserving the context and spacing as is. If there's ambiguity in the intent or the way to resolve the conflict, the best approach is to return the same snippet without making any modifications.

```java

    private int addShiftedKeyInfoIndex(int initialIndex, int onePastEndIndex,
            MultiQueryPackager mpkgr) throws OptimizerException {

        List<Packager> pkgs = mpkgr.getPackagers();
        // if we have lesser pkgs than (onePastEndIndex - initialIndex)
        // its because one or more of the pkgs is a POMultiQueryPackage which
        // internally has packages.
        int numIndices = (onePastEndIndex - initialIndex);
