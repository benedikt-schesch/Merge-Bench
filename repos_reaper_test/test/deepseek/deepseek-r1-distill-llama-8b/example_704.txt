To resolve the merge conflict, we need to decide how to handle the conflicting constant `DIALOG_FIND` and the new constants on the right side. Since the right side introduces additional dialog types while keeping the existing ones, the merged code should reflect both sets of constants to maintain all defined dialog types. This way, no functionality is lost or introduced without clear intent.

```java
    static final int DIALOG_MESSAGE_CLICK = 25;
    static final int DIALOG_GOTO_PARENT = 28;
    static final int DIALOG_EDIT = 29;
    static final int DIALOG_DELETE = 30;
    static final int DIALOG_COMPOSE = 31;
    static final int DIALOG_FIND = 32;  // Conflict: Left side has this line
    static final int DIALOG_REPORT = 33;  // Right side adds this line
    static final int DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK = 34;
    static final int DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE = 35;  // Right side adds this line

    // progress dialogs
    static final int DIALOG_LOGGING_IN = 1000;
    static final int DIALOG_SUBMITTING = 1004;
    static final int DIALOG_REPLYING = 1005;
```
