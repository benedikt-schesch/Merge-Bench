Here is the original code snippet with the merge conflict:

```java
                        if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength) {
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                            }      
<<<<<<< HEAD
                            builder.append(url);
                        } else if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength){
                            if (verbose) {
                                System.err.println("[INFO] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI longer than " + maxUriLength + " characters. Skipping.");
                            }
=======
                            builder.append(url);
                        } else {
>>>>>>> 790b69a0bd40e3ab536f9c6568748f981b3d525e
                            builder.append(url);
                        }
>>>>>>> merge conflict
                        }
```

During a merge, both branches have the same condition but different messages and actions. The correct approach is to maintain the first version, which skips adding the URI if it's too long, and prints a warning only when verbose is enabled.
