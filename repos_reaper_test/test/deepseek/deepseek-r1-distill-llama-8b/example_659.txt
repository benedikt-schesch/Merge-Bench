The code contains a merge conflict where two `@Inject` annotations are present in the same class for different fields. To resolve this, I should determine which dependency is more critical and remove the redundant one.

```java
	@Inject
	private BuildListenerRegistry registry;

	protected AndroidBuildService buildService;

	@Override
	@SuppressWarnings("restriction")
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
	    super.setUp();
```
