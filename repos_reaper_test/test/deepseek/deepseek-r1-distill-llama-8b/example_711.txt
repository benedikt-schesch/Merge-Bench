The provided Java code snippet shows a conflict between two versions: one adding `CHUNK_SIZE` and the other modifying `FALSE` and `TRUE` constants. Without further context, it's ambiguous whether these changes should be merged or kept as conflicting. The intent of each change appears to be related, but the exact resolution can't be determined.

    public static final int FALSE = 0;
