To resolve the merge conflict, we need to decide which version to keep based on the semantic intent. The right side contains the current implementation, so we'll take that.

```java
        listView.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener() {
            
            @Override
            public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> parent, View view,
                    int position, long id) {
                // The selected item's user is being retrieved
                User user = getContextItemUser(position);
                if (user == null) {
                    Log.w(TAG, "selected item not available");
                    specialItemClicked(position);
                } else {
                    // Handle the case where user is not null
                    // This code is active and implements the desired functionality
```
