The conflict seems to involve an if-statement with a comment in one version and without in the other. The right version removes the comment, likely to make the code cleaner by eliminating unnecessary notes. Since the comment indicates doubt, and the right branch omits it, the better approach is to use the cleaner version.

```java
      if (null != player) {
        player.resetSkipCount();
      }

      cardPlayer = playedCards.getPlayerForId(cardId);
```
