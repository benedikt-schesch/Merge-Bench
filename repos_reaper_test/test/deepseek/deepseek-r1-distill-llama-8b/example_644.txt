To resolve the merge conflict, I'll choose the version that uses `assertEquals` for clarity in asserting the content type. This change ensures direct comparison of the method's return value, which is more straightforward and provides a clear failure message.

```java
  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_imagePng() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.png", attachmentData.getBytes());
    assertEquals("image/png", att.getContentType());
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_html() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
```
