To resolve the merge conflict, the code should combine the declaration and the conditional adjustments. The left side only has the declaration, while the right side includes additional logic to modify `orientationCompensation`. Including both ensures the logic is fully integrated.

```java
                    && config.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT)) {
                nativeLandscape = true;
            }

            int orientationCompensation = mOrientation; // + (nativeLandscape ? 0 : 90);
            
            if (orientationCompensation == 90) {
                orientationCompensation += 180;
            } else if (orientationCompensation == 270) {
                orientationCompensation -= 180;
            }
```
