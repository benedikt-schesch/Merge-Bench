The provided code snippet is part of a Java class in the `org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.math` package. The snippet shows a merge conflict between two different versions of the imports. The first version imports only `org.apache.pig.EvalFunc`, while the second version includes additional imports: `org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;`, `org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.schema.Schema;`, and `org.apache.pig.data.DataType;`.

To resolve the merge conflict, we can combine the common import, `org.apache.pig.EvalFunc`, with the additional imports from the second version. This ensures that all necessary classes are imported while preserving the context and intent of the code.

```java
package org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.math;

import org.apache.pig.EvalFunc;
import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.schema.Schema;
import org.apache.pig.data.DataType;

```
