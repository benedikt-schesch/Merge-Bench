The provided code snippet has a conflict between two different annotation interfaces (`@ServerDiscoveryPort` and `@AllowBlankCards`), both annotated with `@BindingAnnotation` and `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)`. Since Java annotations cannot be declared in multiple interfaces for the same purpose, it's necessary to resolve this by either consolidating the functionality or determining which interface should be kept.

```java
  public @interface BannedNicks {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
=======
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD
