To resolve the merge conflict, I will include all variables found on the other branch to ensure the code remains consistent.

```java
Map<OperatorKey, MapReduceOper> splitsSeen;

NodeIdGenerator nig;

private Random r;

private UDFFinder udfFinder;

private CompilationMessageCollector messageCollector = null;

```
