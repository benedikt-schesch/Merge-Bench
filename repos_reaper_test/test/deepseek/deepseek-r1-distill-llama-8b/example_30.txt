The left side includes an import for `Vector3`, while the right side includes a more comprehensive set of imports including `Component`, `Client`, `Platform`, `Spout`, `BaseComponentOwner`, and `EntityComponent`. 

Since the right side includes more necessary imports for the Spout API components, it's appropriate to prefer the right side imports as they cover the required dependencies.

Here's the combined import statements of both sides:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
import org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.HashCodeBuilder;

import org.spout.api.Client;
import org.spout.api.Platform;
import org.spout.api.Spout;
import org.spout.api.component.BaseComponentOwner;
import org.spout.api.component.Component;
import org.spout.api.component.entity.EntityComponent;
```
