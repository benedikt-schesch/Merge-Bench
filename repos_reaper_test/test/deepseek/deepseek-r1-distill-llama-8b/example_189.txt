The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two different import statements and class usages, one related to Hadoop's `JobConf` and the other to Apache Pig's `Main` and `ExecType`. These are from incompatible libraries, so resolving the conflict isn't possible without refactoring. Thus, the conflicting lines are preserved:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobConf;
import org.apache.pig.Main;
=======
import org.apache.pig.FuncSpec;
import org.apache.pig.ExecType;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
```
