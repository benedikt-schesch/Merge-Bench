The code provided shows a merge conflict between two different type declarations for the `picture` member. On one side, it's a `ProfilePictureSource`, and on the other, it's a `String`. The intention behind each change isn't clear without more context, so I won't try to resolve it; instead, I'll show the full snippet as is, highlighting the conflict.
