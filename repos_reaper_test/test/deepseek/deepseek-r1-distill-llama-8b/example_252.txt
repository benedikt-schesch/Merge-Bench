The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict in the `import` statements between two different versions. The HEAD version includes networking-related imports, while the other version includes utility-related imports such as `java.util.*`. To resolve the merge conflict, you should choose the import set that aligns with the intended functionality of the code. If the code requires both sets of imports, merge them appropriately.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.io.SequenceInputStream;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.SocketException;
import java.net.SocketImplFactory;
import java.net.URL;
