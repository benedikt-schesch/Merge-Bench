The merge conflict involves a comment being added and removed between two versions of the code. To resolve the conflict, the comment was moved and updated for clarity, while keeping the boolean variable itself.

To resolve this, the boolean variable `at_timestamp_only` was kept with an updated comment explaining its new purpose.

```java
  /** Special value for {@link #family} when deleting a whole row.  */
  static final byte[] WHOLE_ROW = new byte[0];

  private final byte[][] qualifiers;
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
  /**
   * Whether to delete the value only at the specified timestamp.
   */
  private boolean at_timestamp_only = false;
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f

  /**
   * Constructor to delete an entire row.
   * <strong>These byte arrays will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @param table The table to edit.
