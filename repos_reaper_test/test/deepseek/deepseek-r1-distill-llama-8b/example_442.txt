The merge conflict is between using `canvas.drawBitmap()` and `scene.draw()`. The `scene` object's `draw()` method likely encapsulates the rendering process, providing better control and efficiency over how the scene is drawn. Replacing `canvas.drawBitmap()` with `scene.draw()` is the intended change.

```java
        // tell the scene to update its viewport bitmap
        scene.update();

        // draw it
        scene.draw(canvas);

        if (DEBUG) {
            long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
            double n = ((double) now) / 1000L;
            double s = ((double) startTime) / 1000L;
            double fps = 1L / (n - s);
```
