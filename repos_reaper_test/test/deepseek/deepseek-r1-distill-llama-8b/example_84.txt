The two code snippets provided are almost identical, apart from a minor difference in the initialization of the list. Both versions create an `ArrayList` using the size of the `textParts` collection. The first uses `size()` while the second uses `length()`, which is essentially the same in this context. The loop structure and processing are identical. There appears to be no functional difference, so the code can be considered the same. 

There might not be a clear semantic difference, so as a merge conflict resolution, I should choose the version to keep based on project conventions or preferences.

```java
    final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.size());
  }

  public static String formatWhiteCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // The white cards should only ever have one element in text, but let's be safe.
    final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.size());
    for (final Object o : textParts) {
      final String cardCastString = (String) o;
      if (cardCastString.isEmpty()) {
        // skip blank segments
        continue;
```
