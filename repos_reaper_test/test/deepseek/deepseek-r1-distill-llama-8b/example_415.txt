To resolve the merge conflict in the imports, we should combine the necessary imports from both sides, avoiding duplicates and ensuring all required classes are included.

```java
import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.core.Is.is;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Files;
>>>>>>> resolved
```

The merged import set includes all necessary classes from both sides, ensuring there are no duplicates and all required dependencies are present.
