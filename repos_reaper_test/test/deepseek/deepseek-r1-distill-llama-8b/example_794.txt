The left side uses `markReaderIndex()` and `resetReaderIndex()` to manually manage the buffer's reader index. The right side uses a `ensureReadable()` method, which likely optimizes buffer handling for streaming. Both aim to ensure the buffer can read the required bytes efficiently.

Since `ensureReadable` is designed for streaming/rhodc, I'll use it to replace the manual index management.

```java
      try {
        HBaseRpc.checkArrayLength(buf, length);
        // Make sure we have that many bytes readable.
        // This will have to change to be able to do streaming RPCs where we
        // deserialize parts of the response as it comes off the wire.

        buf.markReaderIndex();
        buf.skipBytes(length);
        buf.resetReaderIndex();
=======
        ensureReadable(buf, length);

      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {

      }
    }
