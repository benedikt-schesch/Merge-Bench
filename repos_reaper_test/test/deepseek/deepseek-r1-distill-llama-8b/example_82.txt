To resolve the semantic conflict, we need to determine the intended changes. The right side introduces 'deckId' as a parameter, replacing 'watermark'. 

The merged code should reflect this change, assuming that deckId is the correct parameter now. The class name is different, so we'll proceed with the right side's constructor.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
  private final String text;
  private final int draw;
  private final int pick;
  private final String watermark;

<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomBlackCard.java
  public CustomBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick, final String watermark) {
=======
  public CardcastBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick,
                           final String deckId) {
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/cardcast/CardcastBlackCard.java
    this.id = id;
    this.text = text;
    this.draw = draw;
    this.pick = pick;
    this.deckId = deckId;
```
