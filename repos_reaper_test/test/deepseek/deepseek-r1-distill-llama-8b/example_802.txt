The merge conflict arises from differences in how `batched_rpcs` is initialized and the handling of `schedule_flush`. The left side initializes `batched_rpcs` with a specific `server_version`, which is important for correct behavior, and sets `schedule_flush` to `true` to trigger a flush. The right side lacks these. To resolve this, the left changes should be retained as they likely ensure proper initialization and necessary side effects.

```java
    MultiAction batch;
    boolean schedule_flush = false;

    synchronized (this) {
        if (batched_rpcs == null) {
            batched_rpcs = new MultiAction(server_version);
            addMultiActionCallbacks(batched_rpcs);
            schedule_flush = true;
        }
        batch = batched_rpcs;
        // Unfortunately we have to hold the monitor on `this` while we do
```
