I notice that there are two separate lines of imports in the code snippet. This might indicate a potential for conflict, especially if the same class is being imported in both sets of imports. However, based on the provided context, there doesn't seem to be any overlapping imports between the two sets. The first set of imports comes directly after the package declaration, while the second set appears later in the code, which could suggest different logical groupings or an eventual merge issue.

Since the task is to preserve the context and not modify the code, I'll return the entire snippet as is, including both sets of imports.

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.TreeMap;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
import org.kohsuke.args4j.spi.BooleanOptionHandler;
import org.kohsuke.args4j.spi.ByteOptionHandler;
import org.kohsuke.args4j.spi.CharOptionHandler;
import org.kohsuke.args4j.spi.DoubleOptionHandler;
import org.kohsuke.args4j.spi.EnumOptionHandler;
