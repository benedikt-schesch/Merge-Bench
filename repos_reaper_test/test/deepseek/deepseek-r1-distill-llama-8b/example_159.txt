To resolve the merge conflict, I'll analyze the changes.

1. **Left Side (HEAD)**: Adds a method `randomizeFileLocalizer()`.
2. **Right Side (f52ad1d...)**: Adds a method `getMRPlan()`.

Both changes are independent and don't modify the same lines. Therefore, they can be merged without conflict.

```java
public void randomizeFileLocalizer() {
    FileLocalizer.setR(new Random());
}

/**
 * Used to get the compiled plan
 * @return map reduce plan built by the compiler
 */
public MROperPlan getMRPlan() {
```
