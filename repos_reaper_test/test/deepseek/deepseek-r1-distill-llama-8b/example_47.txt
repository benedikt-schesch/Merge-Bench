To resolve the merge conflict, the correct approach is to use the version from the right side of the divide. This ensures proper type safety in the `toArray` method and initializes the list correctly using the array's length.

```java
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    final List<String> playerNames = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
        playerNames.add(player.getUser().getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.PLAYERS, playerNames);
```
