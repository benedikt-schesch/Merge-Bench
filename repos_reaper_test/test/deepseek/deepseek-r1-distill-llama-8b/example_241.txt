The code shows a conflict between two import statements. Analysis indicates that `JobCreationException` has been replaced with `HExecutionEngine` in the dependency. To resolve this, the old import should be removed, and the new one added. No additional changes are needed if `HExecutionEngine` is correctly imported and used elsewhere.

Here's the resolved snippet with the correct import:

```java
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.HExecutionEngine;
```
