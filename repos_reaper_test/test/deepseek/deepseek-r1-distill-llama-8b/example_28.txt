The code snippet shows a conflict between two different imports in the same class. The correct import should be `Chunk` from the `cuboid` package due to the context of the class and its purpose.

```java
 */
package org.spout.api.protocol.event;

import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.api.event.ProtocolEvent;

public class BlockUpdateEvent extends ProtocolEvent {
	private static final HandlerList handlers = new HandlerList();
	private final Chunk chunk;
	private final int x, y, z;
```
