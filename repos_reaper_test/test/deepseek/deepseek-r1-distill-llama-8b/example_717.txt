The provided code snippet is from a Java file and represents a merge conflict involving a minor code formatting issue. The conflicting lines are in the `getPosition()` method of a class.

The conflict arises because there are two slightly different ways to write the same conditional logic:

1. Version 1:
```java
MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
if (sMediaPlayer != null)
    return sMediaPlayer.getCurrentPosition();
return 0;
```

2. Version 2:
```java
if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
    return sMediaPlayer.getCurrentPosition();
}
return 0;
```

The semantic difference is purely about code formatting. The first version uses the single-line `if` statement with the return on the next line, while the second uses a block-style `{ }` and an `if` without an explicit block. In terms of intent, both are equivalent as they perform the same function.

To resolve the merge conflict, the choice between the two should be made based on the project's coding style conventions. Since the code is now using the block-style notation in the later change, I would merge it with that version for consistency.

Final merged code will use the block-style if statement:

```java
        }
    }

    @Override
    public long getPosition() {
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            return sMediaPlayer.getCurrentPosition();
        }
        return 0;
    }
```
