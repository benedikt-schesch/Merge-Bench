To resolve the semantic merge conflict, I've restructured the code by creating a private method that encapsulates the common functionality. This improves code organization and reduces redundancy.

The entire code snippet is as follows:

```java
                    info.mThumbnail);
                    mConstructedImageEnlarge();
                }
            };

            private void mConstructedImageEnlarge() {
                flinger.setImageBitmap(info.mThumbnail);
                flinger.doAnimation();
            }

            // Unlock camera auto settings
            mCamManager.setLockSetup(false);
            mCamManager.setStabilization(false);
        }
```
