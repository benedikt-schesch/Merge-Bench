To resolve the merge conflict, we need to import both `ITextureRegion` and `TextureRegionFactory` since they are two different classes from the same package. Both imports can coexist without causing any issues.

```java
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.region.ITextureRegion;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.region.TextureRegionFactory;
```
