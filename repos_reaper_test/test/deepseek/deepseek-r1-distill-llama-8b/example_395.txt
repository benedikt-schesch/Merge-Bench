To resolve the merge conflict, I corrected the method name and fixed a typo. The method is now public and uses the correct method name and method call.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
	public void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun() throws CoreException {
		InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 0);

		workspace.updateProjects(Collections.singleton(resource));

		assertStatusIs(noTestsRun());
		verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));
	}
```
