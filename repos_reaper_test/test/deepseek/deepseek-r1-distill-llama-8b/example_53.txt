The code appears to have a formatting inconsistency where the condition is written in one line on the left, but with additional indentation on the right. This suggests that one side is using a more readable formatting style for the condition. 

Since both sides are trying to check if `playerCards` and `blackCard` are not null and if their sizes match, the fix is simply to format the condition to be more readable. This does not affect the logic.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
          if (playerCards != null && blackCard != null
              && playerCards.size() == blackCard.getPick()) {
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
```

This preserves the surrounding context and spacing while resolving the formatting inconsistency.
