The code snippet shows a merge conflict where the type of the field `venue` changed from `Location` to `Venue` and the presence of the `@Facebook` annotation is lost on the right side. To resolve this, I'll merge the desired field type with the necessary `@Facebook` annotation.

```java
   * @return The location of this event, a structured address object.
   *
   * @ Facebook
>>>>>>> venues Fritz
```
```java
  @Getter
  @Setter
  @Facebook
  private Venue venue;
>>>>>>> 8b70c17e5f2d0eccf9ebc86d89f이 lớn nhất

  /**
   * Number of people interested in the event.
   *
   * @since Graph API 2.1
```
