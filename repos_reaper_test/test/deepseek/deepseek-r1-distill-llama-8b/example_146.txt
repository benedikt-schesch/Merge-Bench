The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two lines declaring the same field 'empty' with different access modifiers: one as 'protected static' and the other as 'private static'. 

After reviewing the context, the lines are:

1. `protected static Result empty = new Result(POStatus.STATUS_NULL, null);`
2. `private static Result empty = new Result(POStatus.STATUS_NULL, null);`

The conflict is due to differing access modifiers. While there's no additional information provided about the intended access level, choosing between them depends on the project's encapsulation standards and whether subclasses or other units need access to this field.

Without further context, it's unclear which version is intended. Thus, the conflict remains unresolved, and both versions should be kept as is.
