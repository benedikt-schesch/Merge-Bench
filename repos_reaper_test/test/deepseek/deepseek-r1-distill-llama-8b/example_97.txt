The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two branches where the right side adds the `gameOptionsProvider` as an additional argument to the `Game` constructor. This suggests that the right branch is using a newer version of the constructor that includes this parameter.

Since the left side (HEAD) does not include `gameOptionsProvider`, it is likely incorrect, and the right side is correct. Therefore, the correct action is to update the left side to include this parameter.

```java
  public void setUp() {
    cuMock = createMock(ConnectedUsers.class);
    gmMock = createMock(GameManager.class);
    metricsMock = createMock(Metrics.class);
    game = new Game(0, cuMock, gmMock, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, gameOptionsProvider);
