Given the context, the code on both sides of the merge uses `EMPTY_ARRAY` and `ZERO_ARRAY` interchangeably when constructing the `dummy` object. The left side (HEAD) uses `EMPTY_ARRAY`, which is a standard way to represent an empty array in Java, while the right side (d543609...) uses `ZERO_ARRAY`, which might be a zero-length array alternative.

**Analysis of the conflict:**
- **HEAD** (LEFT): Uses `EMPTY_ARRAY`, which is commonly used to indicate an empty non-null byte array.
- **d543609...** (RIGHT): Replaces `EMPTY_ARRAY` with `ZERO_ARRAY`, possibly to ensure the array is explicitly zero-length instead of using the empty array constant.

The change from `EMPTY_ARRAY` to `ZERO_ARRAY` might be intentional to handle cases where an empty array isn't intended to be mutable. However, there isn't enough context to confirm the specific intent behind this change. 

**Recommendation:**
1. **Assess usage:** Determine if the code expects a null or zero-length array when family is empty.
2. **Verify impact:** Check downstream code that uses `dummy` to see if both cases behave as expected.
3. **Choose the right approach:** Decide based on whether the code requires an empty array constant or a zero-length array.
4. **Documentation:** Update comments to reflect why `ZERO_ARRAY` was chosen or revert to `EMPTY_ARRAY` if that was the original intention.

```java
                                                  final byte[] family) {
    // Just "fault in" the first region of the table.  Not the most optimal or
    // useful thing to do but gets the job done for now.  TODO(tsuna): Improve.
    final HBaseRpc dummy;
    if (family == EMPTY_ARRAY) {
      dummy = GetRequest.exists(table, EMPTY_ARRAY);
    } else {
      dummy = GetRequest.exists(table, ZERO_ARRAY, family);
    }
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    final Deferred<Object> d = (Deferred) sendRpcToRegion(dummy);
    return d;
  }
