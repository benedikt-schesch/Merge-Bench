The code conflict arises because the two changes in question overwrite the same line, causing a merge conflict. Upon examining the context, it's likely that setting `keyWritable` is necessary for correctly associating input data with its key, while removing `tupIter` indicates that it's no longer needed. Thus, the correct resolution is to keep only the `keyWritable` assignment and remove the `tupIter` line.

The resolved code, preserving the `keyWritable` assignment, is as follows:

```java
     */
    public void attachInput(PigNullableWritable k, Iterator<NullableTuple> inp) {
        try {
            keyWritable = k;
            inputAttached = true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "Error attaching input for key " + k +
                    " in " + name() + " at location " + getOriginalLocations(), e);
```
