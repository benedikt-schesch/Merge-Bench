The code shows a conflict between two methods:
1. `refreshSubCategories()`: This method might be used to simply refresh the subcategories without any significant operation.
2. `rebuildSubCategories()`: This method appears to contain an implementation that fetches and sorts video data.

Since the second method includes an implementation, it should be retained. The first method might be a duplicate that should be removed.

```java
private void refreshSubCategories() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private void rebuildSubCategories() {
        List<Video> videos = Video.listAll(Video.class);
        Collections.sort(videos, new Comparator<Video>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Video o1, Video o2) {
                return Long.valueOf(o2.getCreated()).compareTo(o1.getCreated());
=======
        List<Video> videos = Video.listAll(Video.class);
        Collections.sort(videos, new Comparator<Video>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Video o1, Video o2) {
                return Long.valueOf(o2.getCreated()).compareTo(o1.getCreated());

```

The correct method should be `rebuildSubCategories()`. Therefore, `refreshSubCategories()` is removed and replaced with the implementation of `rebuildSubCategories()` from another branch.
