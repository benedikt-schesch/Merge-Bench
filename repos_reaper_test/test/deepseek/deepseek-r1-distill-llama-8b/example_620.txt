The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict between two imports related to the `Date` type. The left side has `com.restfb.util.DateUtils` imported, while the right side has `java.util.Date`. To resolve this, we need to ensure there's only one correct import. Since `DateUtils` is likely intended, the right side's import is unnecessary and should be removed.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
import com.restfb.Facebook;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper.JsonMappingCompleted;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookJsonMappingException;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
import com.restfb.util.DateUtils;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
