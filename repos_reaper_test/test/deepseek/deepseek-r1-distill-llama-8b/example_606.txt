The left side of the conflict shows the class definition ending without the `serialVersionUID` comment, while the right side starts with a comment block and has an empty `@Getter` and `@Setter` annotations. It appears both are attempting to add or maintain different aspects of the code.

Since both sides represent different stages of the class definition, the appropriate resolution would be to merge the comments with the correct placement.

```java
  }

  public static class MailingAddress extends AbstractFacebookType {

    /**
     * The mailing address ID.
     */
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
```
