To resolve the merge conflict, the duplicate `log` declaration must be removed. The correct code should retain the `log` declaration and include the `ChannelDirectTCPIP` declaration.

```java
 * things to SSH.
 */
class SSHSocketImpl extends SocketImpl {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImpl.class);
    ChannelDirectTCPIP channel;
```
