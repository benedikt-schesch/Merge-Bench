To resolve the merge conflict, we need to incorporate both methods into the same class. The existing method `visitPackage` is empty, and the new `visitPOForEach` is added. We'll arrange them in the correct order.

```java
    public void visitPackage(POPackage pkg) throws VisitorException{
        //do nothing
    }

    public void visitPOForEach(POForEach nfe) throws VisitorException {
        List<PhysicalPlan> inpPlans = nfe.getInputPlans();
        for (PhysicalPlan plan : inpPlans) {
            pushWalker(mCurrentWalker.spawnChildWalker(plan));
            visit();
```
