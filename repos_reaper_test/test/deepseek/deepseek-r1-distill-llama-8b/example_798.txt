I analyze the merge conflict by examining both versions of the comment and understanding the context. The original (__HEAD__) comment is minimal, while the other version provides additional details about HBase 2.x compatibility.

To preserve the most complete and accurate documentation without redundancy, I choose to merge the more thorough comment. This ensures the important information about the protocol version discovery is fully documented.

I select the more detailed comment from the other branch (d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f) as it provides additional context about HBase 2.x compatibility without altering the existing version info.

The final code would include the more comprehensive comment, ensuring clarity and completeness in the documentation without introducing redundancy.

```java
    'g', 'e', 't',
    'P', 'r', 'o', 't', 'o', 'c', 'o', 'l',
    'V', 'e', 'r', 's', 'i', 'o', 'n'
  };

  /**

   * Not exposed as part of the public API, and only used when talking to
   * HBase 0.94.x and earlier.
   * For HBase 2.x and newer versions, this RPC is no longer needed.
