The code is experiencing a conflict between two lines that assign different types to `mUserList`. The first line sets it to `PullToRefreshListView`, while the second line, in a subsequent change, sets it to `ListView`. Since both assignments would overwrite `mUserList`, the correct approach is to preserve the `PullToRefreshListView` type to maintain the intended functionality, and ensure the `setupListHeader` method called afterward can operate correctly.

```java
	@Override
	protected void setupState() {
		setTitle(getActivityTitle());

<<<<<<< HEAD
		mUserList = (PullToRefreshListView) findViewById(R.id.follower_list);
=======
		mUserList = (PullToRefreshListView) findViewById(R.id.follower_list);
>>>>>>> 5f1eecd58485bc3b7c0bc8e0b479d0b2d40f344b

		setupListHeader(true);

		mUserListAdapter = new UserArrayAdapter(this);
		mUserList.setAdapter(mUserListAdapter);
```
