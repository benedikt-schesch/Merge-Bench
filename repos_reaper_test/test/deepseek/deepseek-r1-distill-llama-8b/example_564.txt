The merging process requires resolving the conflict between two different versions of the test method. The version from the `HEAD` branch has a method annotated with `@Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)` which attempts to use a `fail` method. However, the correct approach is to let JUnit's test framework handle the expectation by using the `expected` attribute, ensuring the exception is thrown. The second test method does not have an `expected` attribute, allowing it to proceed without an exception. Therefore, the first test should be kept as is to maintain proper exception handling.

```java
  }

  @Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)
  public void checkInvalidJson() {
    new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST), "{", User.class);
    // This test expects a FacebookJsonMappingException to be thrown
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_reachAllElements() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();
```
