When examining the merge conflict, the main difference is the order of method calls. The left side chains `getCurrentPlayer()` and `getDisplayName()`, while the right does it in a single line. The right is more readable and direct. 

Assuming both aim to get the same value, the right side is better. Thus, it's safe to merge it from the right branch.

```java
	@Override
	public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
		super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
		try {
			if (((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC().isConnected()) {
				outState.putString("player", ((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC()
						.getCurrentPlayer().getDisplayName());
			} else {
				outState.remove("player");
			}
		} catch (Exception e) {
			if (Logger.LOG)
				Logger.log(e);
		}
```
