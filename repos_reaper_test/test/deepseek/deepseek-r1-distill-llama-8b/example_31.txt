To resolve the merge conflict, I considered the intended variable assignment and method usage. The key is to use the correct method and explicitly assign the class member variable with `this.` for clarity. Here's the resolved code:

```java
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public void onAttached() {
		// TODO: Get FOV
		this.projection = Matrix4.createPerspective(fieldOfView, 4.0f / 3.0f, .001f, 1000f);
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public Matrix4 getProjection() {
```
