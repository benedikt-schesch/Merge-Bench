The code snippet provided represents a merge conflict between two different import statements. The left side has an import from `com.spotify.docker.Utils.pushImageTag`, while the right side has an import from `com.spotify.docker.Utils.writeImageInfoFile`. 

The conflict suggests that the two branches of the merge are trying to use different static import statements for the `Utils` class. To resolve this, we need to determine which import is more appropriate based on the intended functionality.

If both static methods (`pushImageTag` and `writeImageInfoFile`) are needed, they may need to be imported individually. If one is redundant and the other is the correct method to use, the incorrect import should be removed. Without additional context, it's challenging to determine the exact resolution. However, the provided code shows a possible replacement of `pushImageTag` with `writeImageInfoFile`.

```java
import static com.google.common.base.Strings.isNullOrEmpty;
import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Ordering.natural;
import static com.spotify.docker.Utils.parseImageName;
import static com.spotify.docker.Utils.writeImageInfoFile;
import static java.util.Collections.emptyList;
