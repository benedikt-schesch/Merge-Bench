To resolve the merge conflict, we should retain the version with the complete Javadoc which includes the @throws tag. This ensures the method's exceptions are properly documented.

```java
     * is based and merge it with the Conf supplied
     *
     * package level access so that this is not publicly used elsewhere
     *
     * @throws IOException

        loadFunc.setLocation(getLoadLocation(pigSplit.getInputIndex(),
                originalConf), job);
