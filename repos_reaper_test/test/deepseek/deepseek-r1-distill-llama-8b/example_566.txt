The merge conflict occurs because both sides of the code are asserting the value of the `counter` variable using different assertion methods. On the left side, it uses `assertThat(counter).isEqualTo(18)` (likely from [AssertJ](https://assertj.com)), while the right side uses `assertEquals(18, counter)` from JUnit.

Since the surrounding code already uses standard JUnit assertions, it's appropriate to use `assertEquals()` to maintain consistency. Therefore, the left side is replaced to match this convention.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
      for (FacebookType type : page) {
        counter++;
      }
    }

    assertEquals(18, counter);
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_snapshot() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();
```
