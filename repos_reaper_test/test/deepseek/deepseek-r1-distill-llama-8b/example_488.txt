The conflict is due to inconsistencies in variable declarations. The left side declares `mOnScreenControlTexture` as `BitmapTexture` while the right side declares it as `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Additionally, the right side introduces new variables `mOnScreenControlBaseTextureRegion`, `mOnScreenControlKnobTextureRegion`, and a boolean flag. The left side seems to be an older version.

To resolve this, the left side should be updated to match the types and include all variables from the right side. This suggests synchronized content from both sides should be combined, with the conflicting type corrected and additional variables added.
