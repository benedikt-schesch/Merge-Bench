The code snippet shows a merge conflict in the declaration of the `mBitmapTexture` field, where one version uses `BitmapTexture` and the other uses `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Additionally, there's the addition of the `mFaceTextureRegion` field in one of the branches.

Without additional context or clarification on the intended behavior, the appropriate resolution is uncertain. If the change from `BitmapTexture` to `BitmapTextureAtlas` is intentional (e.g., to use an atlas for textures), then it should be merged as such. If not, the declaration should remain as `BitmapTexture` and `mFaceTextureRegion` should be added separately.
