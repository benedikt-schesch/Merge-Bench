The merged code should include both the serialVersionUID comment and the added field documentation to maintain both intents. Since version 1.10.0 is consistent across both, it remains unchanged. The field's Javadoc is added below the version comment.

  /**

   * 
   * @return Number of people who like this
   */
```
