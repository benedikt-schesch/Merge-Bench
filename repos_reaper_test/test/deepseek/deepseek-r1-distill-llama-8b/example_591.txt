The merge conflict is in the Javadoc comment of the abstract class declaration. The left side only references DefaultFacebookClient, while the right side includes both DefaultFacebookClient and DefaultLegacyFacebookClient. To resolve this, I will merge both references into a single comment that includes both classes since the abstract class serves both.

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Map.Entry;
import java.util.Set;

/**
