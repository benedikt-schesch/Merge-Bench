The submitted code appears to be fragment of two different code versions. The left code appears to be from an older version with a commented Javadoc block. The right code includes additional imports and a commented setup of a `SimpleBaseGameActivity` with a `Toast`.

Here's the merge strategy:

1. For imported packages on the right:
```java
import org.andengine.opengl.vbo.VertexBufferObjectManager;
import org.andengine.ui.activity.SimpleBaseGameActivity;
import android.widget.Toast;
```
These imports are not present on the left. To resolve the conflict, we can add these imports to the left code, as they seem to be part of the project's dependencies.

2. For the commented code on the right:
This appears to be a setup for a game activity with a basic structure:
```java
public class YourGameActivity extends SimpleBaseGameActivity {
    // ...
}
```
If the left code is part of a larger project, this can be merged as:
```java
public class YourGameActivity extends SimpleBaseGameActivity {
    // Existing code
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        // Any setup code
        Toast.makeText(this, "App ready", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
    // ...
}
```
The key is to integrate these changes without duplicating imports.
