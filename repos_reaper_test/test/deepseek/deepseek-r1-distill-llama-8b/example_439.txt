The code contains a merge conflict where the `setWatched` method and its getter `isWatched` are added in the conflicting branch. To resolve, we need to place these methods after `setCreated` to maintain logical grouping and proper indentation.

```java
    }

    public void setCreated(long created) {
        this.created = created;
    }

    public boolean isWatched() {
        return isWatched;
    }

    public void setWatched(boolean isWatched) {
        this.isWatched = isWatched;
    }
}
```

```java
    }

    public void setCreated(long created) {
        this.created = created;
    }

    public boolean isWatched() {
        return isWatched;
    }

    public void setWatched(boolean isWatched) {
        this.isWatched = isWatched;
    }
```
