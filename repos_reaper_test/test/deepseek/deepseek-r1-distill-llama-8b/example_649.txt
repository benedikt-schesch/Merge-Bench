The provided code snippet shows a semantic conflict in a Java method annotation. The two conflicting changes appear to be related to maintaining Javadoc comments and a method annotation. The initial version has an empty comment, while the later version adds specific documentation. The merged result combines both intents cohesively.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    createdTime = toDateFromLongFormat(rawCreatedTime);
  }

  /**
   * Post-JSON-mapping operation that populates the {@code messageTags} field "by hand".
   *
   * @param jsonMapper
   *          The {@code JsonMapper} that was used to map to this type.
   * @return This method does not return anything.
   *
   @JsonMappingCompleted
   * @param jsonMapper
   *          The {@code JsonMapper} that was used to map to this type.
   */
  protected void jsonMappingCompleted(JsonMapper jsonMapper) {
