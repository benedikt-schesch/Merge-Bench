To resolve the merge conflict, I need to decide which side to keep based on the intended behavior. The left side adds the @Beta annotation, indicating the method is in beta. The right side removes it, possibly because the feature is now stable. Since the method returns false by default and the function is about checking if transport is mTLS, it's more likely stable now. Therefore, I'll keep the method without the @Beta to reflect that.

```java
  /**
   * Returns whether the transport is mTLS.
   *
   * @return boolean indicating if the transport is mTLS.
   */
=======
  public boolean isMtls() {
    return false;
  }
