The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two different comments in the ApacheHttpTransport.java file. The conflict is in the package-level Javadoc comment, where one version says "HTTP low-level transport..." and the other says "HTTP transport..." The commit by 01a6cc54669b5ebf1ea1c3e27e424bba99a0ef3c includes the more specific description, which is likely the preferred version as it clarifies the transport's role. 

To resolve the conflict, we'll keep the comment from the specific commit as it better describes the transport's function.

import org.apache.http.params.BasicHttpParams;
