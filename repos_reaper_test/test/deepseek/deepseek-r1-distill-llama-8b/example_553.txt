The code's function is to return a string or an empty string based on whether the input is null. Both comments describe the same logic but phrased differently. The merged comment is chosen for clarity by explicitly stating the condition.

```java
    /**
     * Returns the given string if it is non-null; the empty string if it is null.
     * 
     * @param string
     *            the string to test and possibly return
     * @return {@code string} itself if it is non-null; {@code ""} if it is null.
     */
    public static String nullToEmpty(String string) {
        return (string == null) ? "" : string;
    }
```
