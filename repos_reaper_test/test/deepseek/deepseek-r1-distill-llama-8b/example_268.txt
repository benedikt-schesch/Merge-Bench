The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict between two versions of a comment. While the comments differ in formatting (spacing), they are functionally the same. Both versions of the comment correctly indicate the intended action of creating `numInputs` bags. Since the code itself remains unchanged and the semantic intent is identical, merging the conflict is straightforward. The merge can be resolved by selecting one of the versions of the comment based on project style guidelines, as the operational logic remains consistent across both versions.

```java
    public Result getNext() throws ExecException {
        if (bags == null) {
            return new Result(POStatus.STATUS_EOP, null);
        }
