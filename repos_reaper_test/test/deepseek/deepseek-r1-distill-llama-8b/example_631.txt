To resolve the conflict, I analyzed both comment variations and determined that the right side (`a17acec...`) is more accurate as it uses the standard term "Picture". This ensures consistency and clarity in the documentation. 

Here's the resolved comment:

```java
   * The user's picture, if provided.
   * 
   * To force Facebook to fill the <code>picture</code> field you have to fetch the user with the <code>fields=picture</code> parameter, otherwise the picture is <code>null</code>.
   * 
<<<<<<< HEAD
   * @return the user's picture as ProfilePictureSource object
=======
   * @return the user's picture as picture object
