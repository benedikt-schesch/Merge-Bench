To resolve the merge conflict, we need to ensure both changes are addressed. The left branch includes the 'Sort' parameter and uses it appropriately, while the right branch is a deprecated method without it. The correct action is to keep the left version as it includes the new functionality.

Final resolution:
Candidates were updated to include 'Sort sort' in the method signature for better functionality, so the left version is kept.

```java
	 *            Offset (0 for none)
	 * @param limit
	 *            Limit (0 for none)
	 * @return
