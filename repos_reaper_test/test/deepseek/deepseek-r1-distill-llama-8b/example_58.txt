The code resolves a merge conflict by selecting the version without the comment since it's redundant and both branches have the same functionality. The functionality remains unchanged, so the conflict is resolved by preserving the version without the extra comment.

```java
      synchronized (players) {
        for (final Player player : players) {
          if (getJudge() == player) {
            continue;
          }

            cards.add(getNextWhiteCard());

          player.getHand().addAll(cards);
          sendCardsToPlayer(player, cards);
