The merge conflict involves two similar lines of code aimed at populating `cardData`. The left side uses `Arrays.asList()`, while the right uses `Collections.singletonList()`. Both methods return a list containing the result of `getFaceDownCardClientData()`, but `Collections.singletonList()` ensures a fail-fast collection, which is safer for concurrent access. There's no reason to prefer one over the other in this context beyond style differences. However, since the change appears intentional, the right side's approach should be adopted for consistency.

```java
          cardData.add(getWhiteCardData(playedCards.getCards(player)));
          faceDownCards--;
        }
        // TODO make this figure out how many blank cards in each spot, for multi-play cards
        while (faceDownCards-- > 0) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
          cardData.add(Arrays.asList(WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()));
=======
          cardData.add(Collections.singletonList(WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()));

        return cardData;

    }
  }
