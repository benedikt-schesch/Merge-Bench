The code is a Java method where a merge conflict exists between two versions. The left side tries to handle conversion to a string using a specific helper, while the right side directly converts to a string using `toString()`. The change appears to aim for a more straightforward conversion.

The `toString()` method is a standard approach to get the string representation of an object, which seems appropriate and carries less potential for unexpected behavior. This could be preferred over a custom method if it's not necessary to use `getStringFrom`.

The conflict is resolved by choosing the `toString()` method as it provides a consistent and reliable string conversion.

```java
       * This is useful if, for example, you've got a @Facebook-annotated string field that you'd like to have a numeric
       * type shoved into.
       *
       * User beware: this will turn *anything* into a string, which might lead to results you don't expect.
