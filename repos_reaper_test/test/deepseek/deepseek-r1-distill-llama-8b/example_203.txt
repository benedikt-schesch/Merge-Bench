To merge the changes effectively, we need to incorporate both updates: renaming the method and correcting the default class. Here's the resolved code:

```java
    /**
     * Forces execution of query (and all queries from which it reads), in order to store result in file
     */

    public ExecJob store(String id, String filename) throws IOException {
        return store(id, filename, SFPig.class.getName() + "()");  // SFPig is the default store function
