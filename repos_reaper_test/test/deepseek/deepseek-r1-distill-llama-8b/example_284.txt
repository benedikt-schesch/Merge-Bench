The code shows a conflict between two different lines in the `setPkgr` method. On the left, the method simply assigns the `pkgr` variable, while on the right, it also sets the parent and illustrator of `pkgr`. To resolve, we need to merge these changes.

```java
public void setPkgr(Packager pkgr) {
    this.pkgr = pkgr;
    pkgr.setParent(this);
    pkgr.setIllustrator(illustrator);
}
```
