To resolve the semantic conflict, both changes need to be merged to ensure proper state management and error checking. The setSameMapKeyType ensures the correct map state, and the check verifies the integrity of the data for accurate optimization.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
            toPkgr.addPackager(cpkgr);
            pkCount = 1;
        }

        toPkgr.setSameMapKeyType(isSameKeyType);
        
        if (pkCount != total) {
            int errCode = 2146;
            String msg = "Internal Error. Inconsistency in key index found during optimization.";
            throw new OptimizerException(msg, errCode, PigException.BUG);
        }
```
