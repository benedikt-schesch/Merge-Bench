The two Javadoc comments for the `getString()` method in the `Localizable` interface both aim to document its purpose. The left comment is more verbose with two lines, while the right comment is slightly more concise but still conveys the same main idea. 

To resolve this merge conflict, we can combine the more concise description from the right with the important detail from the left. This maintains the key semantics while keeping the documentation clear and concise.

```java
  public interface Localizable {
    /**
     * @return The user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     * <p>
```
