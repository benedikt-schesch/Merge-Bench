The code appears to have a trivial conflict where both branches have the same comment and lines, but the right branch has an extra line. Removing the redundant line from the right branch preserves code consistency.

```
        mOpenWidgets.add(widget);

        // Make sure the widget is properly oriented
        widget.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientation, true);

        // Position it properly
        widget.forceFinalY(mTotalHeight - WIDGETS_MARGIN);
        widget.setY(mTotalHeight - WIDGETS_MARGIN);
        mTotalHeight += widget.getMeasuredHeight() + mSpacing;
    }
```
