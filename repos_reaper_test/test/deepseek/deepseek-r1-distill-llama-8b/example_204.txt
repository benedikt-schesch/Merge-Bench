To resolve the merge conflict, we should use the comment from the right side as it provides important context about replication. The developer clearly intended to indicate that the method returns the file length accounting for replication. Thus, it's better to include this detail in the Javadoc.

```java
    }

    /**
     * Returns the length of a file in bytes which exists in the HDFS (accounts for replication).
     * @return length of the file in bytes
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
     * @throws IOException
     */
    public long fileSize(String filename) throws IOException {
        DataStorage dfs = pigContext.getDfs();
        ElementDescriptor elem = dfs.asElement(filename);
