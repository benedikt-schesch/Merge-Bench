The merge conflict is between a single-line and multi-line conditional statement. The block with explicit braces should be used as it's the newer change and improves code formatting and readability.

Here is the resolved code with the selected version:

```java
        mWidgetRenderer.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);
        mSwitchRingPad.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);
        mSavePinger.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);
        mReviewDrawer.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);

    if (mShowcaseView != null) {
        mShowcaseView.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);
    }
    }

    public void updateCapabilities() {
        // Populate the sidebar buttons a little later (so we have camera parameters)
        mHandler.post(new Runnable() {
```
