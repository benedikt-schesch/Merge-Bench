To resolve the merge conflict, the correct method should be taken from the version with proper syntax, including the method body. This ensures the byte comparison is accurately implemented with the expected advertising.

```java
    bytes.assertInRange(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytesAssertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
```
