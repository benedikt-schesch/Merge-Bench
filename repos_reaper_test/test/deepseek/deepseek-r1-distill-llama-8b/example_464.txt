The code snippet shows a merge conflict in an anonymous class declaration. The `serialVersionUID` declaration differs between the two branches, with the `HEAD` version including it within the anonymous class while the other branch declares it outside. Additionally, the initializer block with method calls `setApplyLastModified` and `setContentType` exists in the `HEAD` version but not in the other.

The most likely resolution is that one branch added these settings by mistake and the other reverted them intentionally. Without additional context, the version without the extra settings (`b26c4f8ba13ab0d64627d01dcbba50609ff04a4f`) is retained, as it might represent a deliberate revert.

```java
        return new DefaultResourceLoader();
    }

    private ResourceServlet concreteResourceServlet(final String location) {
        return new ResourceServlet() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            private static final long serialVersionUID = 4602656496188884537L;

			{
                setApplyLastModified(true);
                setContentType("image/png");
            }
        });
    }
```
