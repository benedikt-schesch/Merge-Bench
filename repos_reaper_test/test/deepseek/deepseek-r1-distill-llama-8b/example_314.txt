To resolve the merge conflict, the correct field name in the ViewHolder is updated to **testBtn** to align with the intended changes.

```java
	private static class ViewHolder {
		public ImageView profileImage;
		public TextView screenName;
		public TextView userId;
		public TextView lastStatus;
		public TextView testBtn;
	}

	@Override
	public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
		View view;
```
