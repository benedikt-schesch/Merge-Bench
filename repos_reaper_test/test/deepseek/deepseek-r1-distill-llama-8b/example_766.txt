To resolve this semantic conflict, the code needs to correctly set `this.qualifiers` based on whether `qualifiers` is null and also assign `this.lockid` regardless of the condition. This ensures both operations are performed without any impact on the else logic.

```java
    } else {
      // No specific qualifier to delete: delete the entire family. 
      // If `family == null`, this is harmless.
      this.qualifiers = DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER;
    }
    this.lockid = lockid;
    this.family = family;
    this.qualifiers = qualifiers == null ? DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER : qualifiers;
```
