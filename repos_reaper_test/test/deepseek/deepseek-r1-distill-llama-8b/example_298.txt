To resolve the semantic conflict in the `unmarshal` method, the decision is to select the approach that best fits the intended functionality and error handling without introducing bugs. The right side's approach with `reader.withType().readValue(json)` is likely an attempted improvement, perhaps from a different library or a refactor. However, the left side's use of specific parameters from `DocumentStream` is necessary for proper deserialization, which the right side might not handle correctly. Additionally, the left side's try-catch block captures a more specific exception type, which is preferable for precise error reporting.

```java
    public <T> T unmarshal(DBObject document, Class<T> clazz) throws MarshallingException {

        DocumentStream stream = DocumentStreamFactory.fromDBObject(document);
        try {
            return mapper.readValue(stream.getData(), stream.getOffset(), stream.getSize(), clazz);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            String message = String.format("Unable to unmarshal result to %s from content %s", clazz, document.toString());
            throw new MarshallingException(message, e);
        }
    }

    public DBObject marshall(Object obj) throws MarshallingException {

}
