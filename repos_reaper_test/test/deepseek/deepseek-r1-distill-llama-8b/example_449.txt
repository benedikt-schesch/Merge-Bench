Here is the code snippet with the resolved conflict:

```java

	@Test
	public void parseUrlCode() throws Exception {
		Object scheme = createParser().parse("http://www.github.org/QRCode");
	 assertNotNull(scheme);
	 assertThat(scheme, instanceOf(Url.class));
	 Url urlCode = (Url) scheme;
	 assertEquals("http://www.github.org/QRCode", urlCode.getUrl());
	}

	@Test(expected = UnsupportedEncodingException.class)
```

### Explanation:
The changes aim to fix a merge conflict between two different code snippets. The original version used `assertNotNull` followed by an `assertThat` for type checking, while the conflicting version replaced the `assertThat` with an `assertTrue` statement. The solution combines the best aspects of both, retaining the `assertNotNull` to ensure the object is not null and the `assertThat` for precise type checking. The test checking for `UnsupportedEncodingException` remains as it expects an exception to be thrown.
