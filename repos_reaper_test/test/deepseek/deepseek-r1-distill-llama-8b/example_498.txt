The task is to merge two conflicting changes in a Java code snippet. The changes involve updating a field name from `mBitmapTexture` to `mBitmapTextureAtlas` and adding a new field `mFaceTextureRegion`. 

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Identify Conflicting Changes**:
   - The left branch (HEAD) has the field `mBitmapTexture`.
   - The right branch has `mBitmapTextureAtlas` and introduces `mFaceTextureRegion`.

2. **Determine Merge Strategy**:
   - Update `mBitmapTexture` to `mBitmapTextureAtlas` as per the right branch.
   - Add `mFaceTextureRegion` as it's a new field intended to be used alongside the texture handling.
   - Include existing or new related fields like `mFaceIDCounter` and `mFaces` which are added in the other branch.

3. **Preserve Context**:
   - Ensure the order and spacing of the code remain consistent with the original structure.
   - No modification to non-conflicting parts of the code.
