To resolve the merge conflict, I analyzed the two code snippets and the surrounding context. The key difference is the constructor call to the superclass, with one version passing an extra `operation` parameter and the other omitting it. The class hierarchy's requirements for the constructor parameters are unclear, leading to ambiguous intent. Additionally, the second version includes checks for family and qualifiers, which suggests it might function correctly on its own. However, without knowing if the operation is essential, the conflict remains unresolved.

```java
                        final byte[] key,
                        final byte[] family,
                        final byte[][] qualifiers,
                        final long timestamp,
                        final long lockid) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    super(DELETE, table, key, family == null ? WHOLE_ROW : family, timestamp, lockid);
=======
    super(table, key, family == null ? WHOLE_ROW : family, timestamp, lockid);
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    if (family != null) {
      KeyValue.checkFamily(family);
    }

    if (qualifiers != null) {
