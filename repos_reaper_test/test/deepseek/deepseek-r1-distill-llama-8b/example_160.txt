To resolve the merge conflict, the `log` field is made static and final as it's used in static methods. This ensures the logger is only initialized once, improving efficiency.

```java
    public static JobContext sJobContext = null;

    public static class Combine
            extends Reducer<PigNullableWritable, NullableTuple, PigNullableWritable, Writable> {

        private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Combine.class);

        //HADOOP-3226 Combiners can be called multiple times in both map and reduce
        private static boolean firstTime = true;

        private byte keyType;

        //The reduce plan
        private PhysicalPlan cp;
```
