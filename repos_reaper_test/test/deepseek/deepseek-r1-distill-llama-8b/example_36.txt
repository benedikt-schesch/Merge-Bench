The code shows a merge conflict where the method signatures differ. The left side's `usage` method expects `CommandMetadata`, but the right side passes a `Command`. The left side is correct, so the conflict is resolved by using the left version. Other options like changing the argument type or the method signature would cause different issues.

```java
    public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, String commandName, CommandMetadata command, UsagePrinter out)
    {
        //
        // NAME
        //
        out.append("NAME").newline();
```
