The code snippet is a Java file with conflicting imports in a version control merge. The left side imports `com.google.common.base.Preconditions`, while the right side adds `net.openhft.chronicle.core.Jvm` and `net.openhft.chronicle.core.OS`, leading to a merge conflict.

Without specific usage of `Preconditions` or changes in the code, the imports could indicate a refactoring to use project-specific classes. It's ambiguous whether to keep both imports or which ones to prioritize. Without further context, the imports should be left as they are to preserve functionality.

```java
 */

package net.openhft.chronicle.map;

import com.google.common.base.Preconditions; andr
net.openhft.chronicle.core.Jvm;
import net.openhft.chronicle.core.OS;

import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.rules.TemporaryFolder;

```

I keep both imports to maintain functionality and preserve the original code's behavior.
