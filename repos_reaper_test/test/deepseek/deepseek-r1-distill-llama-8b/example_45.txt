The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two versions of a Java method. The left side (`<<<<<<<`) defines a method `getCustomDeckIds()` returning `Set<Integer>`, while the right side (`=======`) defines `getCardcastDeckIds()` returning `Set<String>`. 

**Analysis:**
- The conflict involves minor changes in both method names and return types.
- `getCustomDeckIds()` likely refers to a set of custom deck IDs, typically represented as integers.
- `getCardcastDeckIds()` suggests a possible typo for "card cast" or "card-cast" and returns a set of strings, possibly referencing card IDs.

**Conclusion:**
The conflict requires determining if the method names and return types align with the project's requirements and dependencies. Without further context, both versions are presented for resolution.
