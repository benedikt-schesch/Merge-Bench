Here's how I analyzed the merge conflict and resolved it:

1. **Identified the intent**: Both sides aim to handle the Bluetooth adapter turning off by managing the GATT server.

2. **Resolving the conflict**:
   - The left side includes an additional line `isAdvertising = false` which was missing on the right side.
   - The right side already has `gattServer.close()`.
   
3. **Consolidated the actions** in a single block to maintain both functionalities without duplication.

**Resolved Code:**

```java
            if (initPeripheralCallback != null) initPeripheralCallback.sendPluginResult(pluginResult);

            break;
          case BluetoothAdapter.STATE_TURNING_OFF:
            if (isAdvertising) {
                isAdvertising = false;
            }

            if (gattServer != null) {
                gattServer.close();
            }
            break;
          case BluetoothAdapter.STATE_ON:

            addProperty(returnObj, keyStatus, statusEnabled);
```
