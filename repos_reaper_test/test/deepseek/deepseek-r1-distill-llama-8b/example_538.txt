To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine which version to keep based on intent and semantic meaning.

After analyzing, the change suggests adding a bias to improve location accuracy, which enhances user experience. Therefore, we'll include the intent with the bias.

```java
        result = true; //Probably better to default to true
      }
    }

    return result;
  }

  private void requestLocationAction(CallbackContext callbackContext) {
    locationCallback = callbackContext;

    Intent intent = new Intent(android.provider.Settings.ACTION_LOCATION_SOURCE_SETTINGS);
    intent.putExtra(android.provider.Settings.EXTRA_BIAS, android.provider.Settings.QUALITY_BESTORITY); // Added bias for best location quality
    cordova.startActivityForResult(this, intent, REQUEST_LOCATION_SOURCE_SETTINGS);
