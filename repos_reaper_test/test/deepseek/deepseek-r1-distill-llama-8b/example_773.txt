The right side adds important clarifications that were not present in the left side. Here's the merged version:

```java
  /**
   * Specifies a particular column qualifier to scan.
   * <p>
   * Note that specifying a qualifier without a family has no effect.
   * Note: The column qualifier will not be copied by this method. 
   * Additionally, you must call {@link #setFamily(byte[])} to associate this qualifier with a family.
   * If you just specify a qualifier without a family, this method will not have any effect.
   * <strong>This byte array will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @param qualifier The column qualifier.
   * @throws IllegalStateException if scanning already started.
   */
  public void setQualifier(final byte[] qualifier) {
