To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine which approach to use for setting the version. The left side hardcodes the version, while the right dynamically fetches it. Since the intention is to use the current release version, the dynamic approach is preferable. Therefore, we'll keep the right side.

```java
 * @author rmistry@google.com (Ravi Mistry)
 */
public final class GoogleUtils {

  /** Current release version. */
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public static final String VERSION = "1.30.5".toString();
  // {x-version-update-end:google-api-client:current}
=======
  public static final String VERSION = getVersion();
>>>>>>> a6c6decbd4a162ff4030e2c3f74c72eb6ac9eddb

  // NOTE: Integer instead of int so compiler thinks it isn't a constant, so it won't inline it
  /**
   * Major part of the current release version.
  *
```
