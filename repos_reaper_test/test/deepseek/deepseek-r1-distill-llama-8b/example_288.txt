Since there's a semantic conflict between maintaining the existing code and adding documentation, and assuming the intention is to preserve both, the code can be kept as is with both changes included:

```java
    }

    public void setNumInps(int numInps) {
        this.numInputs = numInps;
        pkgr.setNumInputs(numInps);
        readOnce = new boolean[numInputs];
        for (int i = 0; i < numInputs; i++)
            readOnce[i] = false;
        /**
         * From the inputs, constructs the output tuple for this co-group in the
         * required format which is (key, {bag of tuples from input 1}, {bag of
         */

```

The merge combines both changes while maintaining the functionality and adding the documentation.
