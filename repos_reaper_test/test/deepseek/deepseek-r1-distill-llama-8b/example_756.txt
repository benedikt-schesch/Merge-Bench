The code before the conflict creates a progress dialog to inform the user that the app is binding to a service, which improves user experience by providing feedback during an otherwise unattended operation. The code after the conflict skips this, instead setting a 'registered' flag. Both changes aim to handle service binding, but the intent differs in user feedback. The original dialog adds clarity for the user, so it might be preferable unless there's a reason not to show it. Since the exact reason isn't clear, both options are valid. For purpose of this exercise, the code with the dialog is selected as it improves user experience.

```java

            // bind to service
            mServiceConnection = new OpenPgpServiceConnection(
                    PgpHandler.this, providerPackageName, this);
            mServiceConnection.bindToService();

            bindingDialog = new ProgressDialog(this);
            bindingDialog.setMessage(this.getResources().getString(R.string.okc_progress_text));
            bindingDialog.setCancelable(false);
            bindingDialog.show();
```
