To resolve the merge conflict, it's important to understand the intent of both changes. The first developer is updating the method to remove a parameter, while the second seems to not require any parameters. Since it's unclear which version is correct, preserving both with a conflict notation is necessary.

```java
    Date dateStart = toDateFromLongFormat(rawStartTime);
    startTime = dateStart == null ? toDateFromShortFormat(rawStartTime) : dateStart;
  }
