The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict in a Java constructor. On one side, the constructor parameters are `(final String msg, final HBaseException cause, final HBaseRpc rpc, final Deferred deferred)`, while on the other, it's `(final String msg, final HBaseException cause, final Deferred<?> deferred)`. This discrepancy causes a signature mismatch, making both versions incompatible. The mutual intents are likely to assign the constructor parameters to instance variables correctly.

```java
   * @param deferred A deferred one can wait on before retrying the failed RPC.
   */
  PleaseThrottleException(final String msg,
                          final HBaseException cause,
                          final HBaseRpc rpc,
                          final Deferred deferred) {
