To resolve the merge conflict, we need to retain only one of the Vector3 imports, as having both may cause errors or ambiguity. The correct approach is to use the newer `Vector3` from `org.spout.api.math` as it probably contains more recent updates or improvements.

```java
import org.spout.api.geo.LoadOption;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.WorldSource;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Block;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
=======
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;

import org.spout.api.util.StringUtil;

/**
 * Represents a position in a World
 */
```
