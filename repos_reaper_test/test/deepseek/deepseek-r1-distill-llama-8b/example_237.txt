The merge resolves by combining the changes from both branches. The right side adds the `deleteOnExit()` to clean up the temp file automatically and specifies UTF-8 encoding for better portability. These are good practices, so they should be included.

```java
	static public File createInputFile(String tmpFilenamePrefix, 
			                           String tmpFilenameSuffix, 
			                           String[] inputData) 
	throws IOException {
	\File f = File.createTempFile(tmpFilenamePrefix, tmpFilenameSuffix);
		f.deleteOnExit();
		PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(f), "UTF-8"));
		for (int i=0; i<inputData.length; i++){
			pw.println(inputData[i]);
		}
		pw.close();
		return f;
	}
```
