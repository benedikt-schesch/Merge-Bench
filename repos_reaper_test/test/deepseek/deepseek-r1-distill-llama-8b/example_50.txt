To resolve the merge conflict, we'll retain the left version of the code as it initializes the `FINITE_PLAYTIMES` set using an unmodifiable collection to ensure immutability, preventing unintended modifications that could cause issues in the application.

```java
  private final static int JUDGE_TIMEOUT_PER_CARD = 7 * 1000;
  private final static int MAX_SKIPS_BEFORE_KICK = 2;
  private final static Set<String> FINITE_PLAYTIMES;

  static {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    final Set<String> finitePlaytimes = new TreeSet<String>(Arrays.asList(
        new String[]{"0.25x", "0.5x", "0.75x", "1x", "1.25x", "1.5x", "1.75x", "2x", "2.5x", "3x", "4x", "5x", "10x"}));
    FINITE_PLAYTIMES = Collections.unmodifiableSet(finitePlaytimes);
