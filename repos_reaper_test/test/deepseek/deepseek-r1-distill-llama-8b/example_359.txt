The code snippets provided are essentially identical in content, differing only by line formatting (spacing after the colon). Both describe the same behavior. In a merge, choose one based on style preference or project guidelines, as there's no semantic conflict.

The resolved code should be one of the two. Since the user provided both as parts of the conflict, the selection would depend on the merge tool's preference or project style.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
