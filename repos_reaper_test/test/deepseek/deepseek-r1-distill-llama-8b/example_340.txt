To resolve the merge conflict, I analyzed both sides and determined that the right branch is an optimized version aiming to replace the deprecated method. The left branch's `setRefreshAnimation` is deprecated, so the right's approach is better. The `false` in the condition seems incorrect, so I removed it to allow the animation to run when `v` is not null.

```java
	/**
	 * @param v
	 * @deprecated use {@link WithHeaderActivity#setRefreshAnimation(boolean)}
	 */
	protected void animRotate(View v) {
	    // Remove the deprecated method call
	    if (null != v) {
			Animation anim = AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(v.getContext(),
					R.anim.rotate360);
			v.startAnimation(anim);
		}
