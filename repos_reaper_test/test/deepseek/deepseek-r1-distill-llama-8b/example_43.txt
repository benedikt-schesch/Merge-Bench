The merge conflict was between two differing comment lines about which term to use for synchronization. The correct term is "spectators" to reflect that it's a collection of multiple users.

```java
  }

  /**
   * Remove a spectator from the game.
   * <br/>
<<<<<<< HEAD
   * Synchronizes on {@link #spectator}.
=======
   * Synchronizes on {@link #spectators}.

   *
   * @param user Spectator to remove from the game.
   */
  public void removeSpectator(final User user) {
    logger.info(String.format("Removing spectator %s from game %d.", user.toString(), id));
```
