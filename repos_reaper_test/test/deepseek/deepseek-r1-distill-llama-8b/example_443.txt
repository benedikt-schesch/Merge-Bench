The merge conflict is due to different sets of imports being added by each side of the merge. To resolve this, we should combine the imports in a way that includes all necessary imports from both sides while avoiding duplicates.

The original context seems to involve importing core Android view-related classes and custom/external dependencies. The left side has imports like `SurfaceHolder` and `SurfaceView`, while the right side adds `Scroller`, `InputStreamScene`, and `InputStream` imports.

To resolve this, we'll keep all these imports:

```java
import android.graphics.Point;
import android.util.AttributeSet;
import android.util.Log;
import android.view.*;
import android.view.GestureDetector.OnGestureListener;
import android.view.MotionEvent;
import android.view.Scroller;
import com.sigseg.android.view.InputStreamScene;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
```

This merge includes all imports from both sides without duplicates, ensuring that the most needed classes are available for the code to compile and function correctly.
