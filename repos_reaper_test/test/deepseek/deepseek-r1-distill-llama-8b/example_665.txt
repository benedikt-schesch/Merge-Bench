To resolve the merge conflict, I will update `resolveCalendarField` with `registry` as `IMavenProjectRegistry`, which aligns with the context of Maven project configuration. The remaining fields should be kept as they are.

```java
    @Inject private List<ClasspathConfigurer> classpathConfigurers;

    @Inject private AndroidProjectFactory<MavenAndroidProject, MavenProject> mavenProjectFactory;

    @Inject private AndroidProjectFactory<EclipseAndroidProject, IProject> eclipseProjectFactory;
    
    @Inject private IMavenProjectRegistry registry;

    public void configure(ProjectConfigurationRequest request, IProgressMonitor monitor) throws CoreException {
        markerManager.deleteMarkers(request.getPom(), AndroidMavenPlugin.APKLIB_ERROR_TYPE);

        try {
```
