The merge conflict arises because the left constructor has four parameters but only initializes options and maxUriLength, omitting verbose, while the right constructor has three parameters and initializes verbose, which the left does not. The left constructor with four parameters is likely the correct one, so we should include it in full, ensuring verbose is properly set by pulling the assignment from the right.

```java
        this.options = options;
        this.maxUriLength = maxUriLength;
        this.verbose = verbose;
    }

    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Get/Set verbose flag
    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    public boolean getVerbose(){

```
