To address the merge conflict in the code, we need to analyze both sides of the conflict and determine which approach best achieves the intended functionality. 

1. **HEAD Side (`(orientation + 45) / 90 * 90`)**:
   - This line adds 45 degrees to the current orientation and then applies the division and multiplication, which effectively adds a 45-degree rotation. This might be intended to adjust the orientation when the display remains at 90 degrees.
   
2. **Commented Line (`(360 - orientation + 45) / 90 * 90`)**:
   - This line suggests a different approach to calculating rotation by subtracting the current orientation from 360, then adding 45, and applying the same operations. This could be an alternative method to adjust the orientation, but it's not clear what specific issue this addresses.

3. **Below Code**:
   - The subsequent if-else block checks if the camera is facing forwards or backwards. It calculates `rotation` differently for each case, which suggests that the rotation adjustment depends on the camera's orientation relative to the device's.

**Analysis**:
- The lines above the if-else block both aim to calculate `orientation`, but the commented line seems like an alternative approach that might have been considered but then changed. The HEAD line might be the current implementation, while the commented line is an earlier attempt.
- The if-else block below calculates `rotation` based on camera direction, which seems necessary for correctly adjusting the image orientation when using the camera.
- Without additional context, it's unclear why there's a discrepancy between the two methods. It could be that the commented line was superseded by the HEAD line for a specific reason, or perhaps both methods were intended for different scenarios.

**Recommendation**:
Since the reasons for the divergent approaches aren't clear, the best course of action is to:
1. **Leave the comment as is** to preserve both approaches for future reference.
2. **Decide which method is appropriate** based on the desired functionality and update the code accordingly, ensuring that it matches the intended behavior.
3. **Communicate the reasoning** to the team to clarify the intended functionality and choose the most suitable approach.

**Final Snippet**:
```java
        // Rotate the pictures accordingly (display is kept at 90 degrees)
        Camera.CameraInfo info =
                new android.hardware.Camera.CameraInfo();
        Camera.getCameraInfo(mCurrentFacing, info);
<<<<<<< HEAD
        orientation = (orientation + 45) / 90 * 90;
=======
        //orientation = (360 - orientation + 45) / 90 * 90;
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
        int rotation = 0;
        if (info.facing == Camera.CameraInfo.CAMERA_FACING_FRONT) {
            rotation = (info.orientation - orientation + 360) % 360;
        } else {  // back-facing camera
            rotation = (info.orientation + orientation) % 360;
```
