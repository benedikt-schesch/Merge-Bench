To resolve the merge conflict, I observed that both sides have identical `System.exit(1);` lines with the same surrounding code. Since there's no indication of intended differences, the conflict is resolved by keeping both versions as they are.

```java

            System.exit(1);
        }
        Reference baseRef = endpoint != null ? new Reference(endpoint) : null;
        return JaxRsIntrospector.getDefinition(jaxrsApplication,
