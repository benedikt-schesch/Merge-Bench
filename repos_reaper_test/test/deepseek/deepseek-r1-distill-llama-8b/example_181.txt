```java
    public String getInitial() {
        return Initial.class.getName();
    }

    public String getIntermed() {
        return Intermediate.class.getName();
    }

    public String getFinal() {
        return Final.class.getName();
    }
```

Option 1: If all methods should reference the same type, you could standardize them to all use the same class. If that's not the case, preserve the last checked out version or mark it as a conflict requiring manual resolution.

> Since you've indicated the conflict requires resolution, if the intent is clear, choose one version; if ambiguous, mark as unresolved. Here, assuming the intent is to use `Intermediate`, the code is updated accordingly.
