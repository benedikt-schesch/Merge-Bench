Based on the context, it appears there is a syntax issue on the left side where the `}` is missing before the `else if` condition. The right side uses proper syntax with the curly brace. To resolve the merge conflict, we should maintain the correct syntax structure.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
        public void run() {
          writeQAction(args, callbackContext);
        }
      });
      return true;
    }
    else if (readDescriptorActionName.equals(action)) {

      cordova.getThreadPool().execute(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
          readDescriptorAction(args, callbackContext);
        }
      });
```
