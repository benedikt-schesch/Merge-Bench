To resolve the conflict, the correct approach is to use the right side's method which properly handles the right subtree traversal, ensuring accurate node removal.

```java
	/**
	 * Remove the node u from the binary search tree
	 * @param u
	 */
	protected void remove(Node u) {
		if (u.right == nil) {
			splice(u);
		} else {
			Node w = u.right;
			while (w.left != nil) 
				w = w.left;
		}
	}
```
