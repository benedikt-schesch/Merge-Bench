The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two different formatted versions of a license header. The left side is well-formatted, while the right side has inconsistent formatting and lowercase letters. 

The conflict is likely due to a formatter changing the style, possibly for consistency. To resolve this, the user should decide whether the specific formatting is intentional or if a uniform style is preferred. Both versions have the same content, so the fix would be to apply a consistent formatting style across all instances.
