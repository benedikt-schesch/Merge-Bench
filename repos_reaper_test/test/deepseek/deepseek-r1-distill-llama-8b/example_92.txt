To resolve the merge conflict, the code should be combined to include the additions from the right branch while preserving the function's logic. Here's the resolved code:

```java
  @Override
  public Map<ReturnableData, Object> handle(final RequestWrapper request,
                                            final HttpSession session) {
    final HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> ret = new HashMap<ReturnableData, Object>();
    ret.put(AjaxResponse.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED, gameChatEnabled);
    ret.put(AjaxResponse.GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED, globalChatEnabled);
    if (banList.contains(request.getRemoteAddr())) {
      LOG.info(String.format("Rejecting user from %s because they are banned.",
              request.getRemoteAddr()));
```
