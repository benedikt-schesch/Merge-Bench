The code snippet is a Java section with a merge conflict. The conflict occurs because there are two different ways to set the `applicationPath`. The left side declares and retrieves the `applicationPath` directly from the `application` object, while the right side uses a variable `$application` that was likely introduced in a previous change.

Since the intent of both changes seems to be to set the `applicationPath` using the `ApplicationPath` annotation, the conflict should be resolved by combining both approaches. The final code should declare the variable if it doesn't exist and retrieve the annotation while ensuring proper access.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    // Declare the application variable if it doesn't exist
    Application application = NapoliSingleton.application;
    
    if (baseRef != null) {
        collectInfo.setApplicationPath(baseRef.getPath());
    } else if (application != null) {
        // Retrieve the ApplicationPath annotation and set it if available
        ApplicationPath applicationPath = application.getClass().getAnnotation(
                ApplicationPath.class);
        if (applicationPath != null) {
            collectInfo.setApplicationPath(applicationPath.value());
        }
    }
```
