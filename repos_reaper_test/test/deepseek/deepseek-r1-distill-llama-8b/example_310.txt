The conflict arises from changing the database source from `getDb().fetchAllTweets(...)` to `getDb2().fetchAllTweets(...)` in the same method. The intention is to switch the source of the tweets to a different table (`StatusTable`). The other parts of the code don't change, so updating the method's source should suffice.

```java
	}
	}

	@Override
	protected Cursor fetchAllTweets() {
		return getDb2().fetchAllTweets(StatusTable.TABLE_NAME);
>>>>>>> de460f053e7948460b81e71a410d665d956db90a
=======
	}

	@Override
	protected Cursor fetchAllTweets() {
		return getDb2().fetchAllTweets(StatusTable.TABLE_NAME);
>>>>>>> de460f053e7948460b81e71a410d665d956db90a
}
```

The entire snippet is the updated version that resolves the merge conflict by switching database sources.
