To resolve the merge conflict, I analyzed the conflicting code and determined the correct structure for the Javadoc comment and field declaration. The right side mistakenly included annotations meant for methods on the class level. The @since tag should be correctly placed above the field, and @Getter and @Setter annotations should be on the method declarations. 

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class Thumbnail extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
