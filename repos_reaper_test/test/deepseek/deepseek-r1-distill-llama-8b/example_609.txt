The conflict involves adding `@Getter`, `@Setter`, and `@Facebook` annotations to the `type` field's declaration.

Both changes involve the `type` field:

1. (HEAD)
   - Keeps `serialVersionUID` as a non-annotated field declaration
   - Isolated from the annotations

2. (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe)
   - Adds several annotations to the field declaration

The right side appears to be adding field-level annotations which might be necessary for the framework to properly handle the accessor methods for the field.

To resolve the conflict, we should keep both changes by combining the IDEOGRAPHICAL merge, showing both annotations and the field together.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageStartInfo extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

=======
    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    private String type;
