To resolve the merge conflict, the correct approach is to merge the conditions in the if statement to maintain the original intent of checking both client.server_version and isVersionRequest(payload).

```java
            // pretty quickly. Since it's most likely going to fit in the same
            // packet we send out, it adds ~zero overhead. But don't piggyback a
            // version request if the payload is already a version request or if
            // we already know the server version.
            final ChannelBuffer buf;
            if (client.server_version < 0 && !isVersionRequest(payload)) {
              final ChannelBuffer version =
                client.encode(client.getProtocolVersionRequest());
              buf = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(header, payload, version);
            } else {
              buf = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(header, payload);
            }
```
