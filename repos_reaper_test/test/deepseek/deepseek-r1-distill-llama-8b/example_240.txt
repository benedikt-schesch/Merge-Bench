To resolve the merge conflict between the two versions, we need to understand the intent and goals of each change. The first version imports only the essential Java I/O classes, while the second adds additional networking-related imports and reflection, likely for enhanced functionality. Since the intent is unclear, preserving both as a conflict allows further assessment.
