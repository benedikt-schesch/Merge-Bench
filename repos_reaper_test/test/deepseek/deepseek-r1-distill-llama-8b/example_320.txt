The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict. It shows two versions of the code at the same line range:
- The left side (OPâ€™s version) includes an `if` statement checking `TwitterApplication.DEBUG` and calling `DebugTimer.betweenEnd` if the condition is true. It then returns `str`.
- The right side (conflicting version) omits this `if` statement and only returns `str`.

Without additional context, the intent behind the inclusion or exclusion of the debug logging isn't clear. Therefore, the conflict remains unresolved.

```java
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new ResponseException(e.getMessage(), e);
                }
            }
        }
