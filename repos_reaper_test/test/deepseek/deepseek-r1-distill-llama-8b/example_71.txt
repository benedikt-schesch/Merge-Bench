The code snippet shows a merge conflict in a Java method where two versions of the same code differ in creating an array of Players. The conflict arises from using `players.toArray(new Player[players.size()])` versus `players.toArray(new Player[0])`. The correct approach is to use `toArray(new Player[0])` as it allows the array size to be dynamically determined, which is more efficient.

```java
  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
   */
  private List<User> playersToUsers() {
    final List<User> users;
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    users = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      users.add(player.getUser());
    }
    synchronized (spectators) {
      users.addAll(spectators);
    }
  }
```
