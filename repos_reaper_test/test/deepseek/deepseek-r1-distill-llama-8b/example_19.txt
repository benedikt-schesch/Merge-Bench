The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict between two versions of the `start()` method in a Java class. One version is an abstract method without parameters, while the other is an overloaded method with a `boolean` parameter. To resolve this, we need to determine the intended functionality of both methods and ensure they coexist harmoniously.

```
	@Override
	public String getAPIVersion() {
		return SpoutEngine.class.getPackage().getImplementationVersion();
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	public void start() {
=======
	public abstract void start();

	public void start(boolean checkWorlds) {
		Spout.info("Spout is starting in {0}-only mode.", getPlatform().name().toLowerCase());
		Spout.info("Current version is {0} (Implementing SpoutAPI {1}).", getVersion(), getAPIVersion());
		Spout.info("This software is currently in alpha status so components may");
		Spout.info("have bugs or not work at all. Please report any issues to");
		Spout.info("http://issues.spout.org");
