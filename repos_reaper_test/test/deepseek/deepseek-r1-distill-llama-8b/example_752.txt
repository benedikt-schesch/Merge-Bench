To resolve the merge conflict, we need to ensure that the event processing and setup for the first event occur before checking if it's the last event. The `return true` statement exits the method prematurely, so we'll remove that, allowing the code to process all events correctly.

```java
		if(result.isLastEvent()){
			this.concludeMeasurement();		
			return true;
		}
		
<<<<<<< HEAD
		evaluator.addResult(result.getInstance(), result.getClassVotes());		
=======
		evaluator.addResult(result.getInstance(), result.getClassVotes());
		totalCount += 1;
		
		if(totalCount == 1){
			sampleStart = System.nanoTime();
			experimentStart = sampleStart;
		}

		if(result.isLastEvent()){
			this.concludeMeasurement();
		}
