The text you've provided appears to be a snippet of Java code that includes two different patterns for `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS` compiled with slight variations. Based on the provided content, it seems there is a merge conflict in this section, as the patterns are different between the two versions.

If I need to resolve this, I would consider the intent behind each pattern and determine which version better serves the desired functionality. If you provide more context about the intended behavior of these patterns, I can help make a more informed decision on how to resolve the merge conflict.

The current code, as shown, seems to represent a conflict between two version history, and I would recommend keeping both patterns for now to preserve the ambiguity until the intended resolution can be determined.

```java
  /* Begin public constants */
  public static final Pattern AT_SIGNS = Pattern.compile("[" + AT_SIGNS_CHARS + "]");
