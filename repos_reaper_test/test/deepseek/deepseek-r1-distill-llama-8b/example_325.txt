The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict where the left side includes setting the gesture listener and the right side does not. To resolve this, we need to determine the intended behavior. If the gesture listener should only be set when `useGestrue` is true, the left side is correct. Otherwise, the right side may indicate that the listener should not be set. 

Here is the full context with the conflict highlighted:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
            myGestureListener = new FlingGestureListener(this,
                    MyActivityFlipper.create(this));
            getTweetList().setOnTouchListener(myGestureListener);
