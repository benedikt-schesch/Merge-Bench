To resolve the merge conflict, we need to integrate both versions to ensure the method correctly initializes the request with the URL. 

The left side initializes the request without any parameters, while the right side uses the provided URL. The correct approach is to merge these changes, ensuring the URL is included when creating the request.

```java
  public EnumSet<HttpMethod> supportedOptionalMethods =
      EnumSet.of(HttpMethod.HEAD, HttpMethod.PATCH);

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildDeleteRequest(String url) throws IOException {
      return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
