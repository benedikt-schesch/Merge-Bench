To resolve the merge conflict, I analyzed the two code snippets. The left (HEAD) version includes fixing the accessor and checks if the value is null. The right version checks a different condition but misses the accessor fix. The merged code needs to include both actions while aligning the condition.

Here is the merged result:

```java
    public boolean mustGenerateObjectId(Object pojo) {
        for (BeanPropertyDefinition def : beanDescription(pojo.getClass()).findProperties()) {
            if (idSelector.isId(def)) {
                AnnotatedMember accessor = def.getAccessor();
                accessor.fixAccess(true);
                return isObjectId(def) && accessor.getValue(pojo) == null;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

This version merges both the accessor fix and the condition from the right branch, ensuring all necessary steps are included.
