The code snippet from version `HEAD` and version `5b113d182581d1ed140bc7768a508344f19d7d6e` differ in the ordering of comments and variable declarations. This appears to be a reordering conflict where the lines from HEAD and the target branch are not synchronized in the same order. 

The specific conflict is that the `// override transition animation...` comment is in a different location in the code. To resolve this, you'll need to decide the correct placement of this comment based on the intended code structure.

Here is the full context as provided:

```java
    private String mEditTargetBody = null;
    private String mDeleteTargetKind = null;
    private boolean mShouldClearReply = false;
    private AsyncTask<?, ?, ?> mCurrentDownloadCommentsTask = null;
    private final Object mCurrentDownloadCommentsTaskLock = new Object();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private String last_search_string;
    private int last_found_position = -1;
    private int translucent_yellow;
    // ProgressDialogs with percentage bars
    private AutoResetProgressDialog mLoadingCommentsProgress;
=======
    private boolean mCanChord = false;
    
    // override transition animation available Android 2.0 (SDK Level 5) and above
    private static Method mActivity_overridePendingTransition;
>>>>>>> 5b113d182581d1ed140bc7768a508344f19d7d6e
=======
The lines in the target branch (5b113d182581d1ed140bc7768a508344f19d7d6e) have a different order of declarations and comments compared to the HEAD. The specific conflict is the placement of the comment "// override transition animation..." and the surrounding variable declarations.
