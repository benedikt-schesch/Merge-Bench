The merge involves keeping both changes. Here's the resolved code:

```java
		if (current != null) {
			return current;
		}
		
		if (Spout.getEngine().getPlatform() == Platform.CLIENT) {
			region.startMeshGeneratorThread();
		}

		int threshold = warnThreshold.get();
		if (regionsLoaded.getAndIncrement() > threshold) {
			Spout.getLogger().info("Warning: number of spout regions exceeds " + threshold + " when creating (" +
                x + ", " + y + ", " + z + ")");
```
