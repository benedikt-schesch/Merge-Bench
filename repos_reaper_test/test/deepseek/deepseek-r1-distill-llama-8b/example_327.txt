The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict in the `refresh` method of a Java class. The conflict arises between two different implementations of the method, one with a return statement and another without. The challenge is to determine which version to keep based on the intent of the code.

To preserve both semantics, the final code will reflect both implementations, indicating the conflict.

```java
				});
		return view;
	}

	public void refresh(ArrayList<User> users) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		mUsers = (ArrayList<User>)users.clone();
=======
		mUsers = (ArrayList<User>) users.clone();
>>>>>>> 5f1eecd58485bc3b7c0bc8e0b479d0b2d40f344b
		notifyDataSetChanged();
	}

	@Override
	public void refresh() {
>>>>>>> ee946bbcb717dd7c313c5f3a0 fran√ßais
```

The conflict is evident in the `refresh` method where both versions either include or exclude the line `mUsers = (ArrayList<User>) users.clone();`. The presence of both implementations suggests a divergent intent, and thus the conflict is preserved.
