The code snippet shows a merge conflict in a Java class, specifically a method declaration for `isDistinct()`. The left side adds a Javadoc comment, while the right side only includes the method declaration without the comment. 

Considering the intent, both sides aim to document or declare the method. Since keeping the comment improves readability and provides purpose, it's logical to include it. Thus, the left side's comment is merged.

```java
    /**
     * Find out if the bag is distinct.
     */
    public abstract boolean isDistinct();
=======
    public abstract boolean isDistinct();
