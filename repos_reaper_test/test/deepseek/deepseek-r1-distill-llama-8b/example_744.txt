If there's a merge conflict, it suggests that different versions of the code have different code. The code above shows a potential issue where braces are missing on one side.

The left side (HEAD) is:
```
if (widget != ignore)
    widget.setYSmooth(mTotalHeight);
```
The right side (c923...ogic) is:
```
if (widget != ignore) {
    widget.setYSmooth(mTotalHeight);
}
```

The right side is more correct as it includes braces, making the code clearer and more reliable.

If the intention was to include the setYSmooth line conditionally, the left version is missing the braces and might be incomplete or confusing.

To resolve the conflict, consider whether to keep or discard the missing braces based on your coding standards. The right side is the better choice.
