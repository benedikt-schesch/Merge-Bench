The provided code snippet shows a conflict between two versions of the `exec()` method. The left side has a `catch` block that includes logging when a permission exception is encountered, while the right side also includes the same code but with different indentation. Both versions of the code appear to have the same content, differing only in formatting (indentation). This suggests that the changes are semantic and not functional, possibly due to formatting differences in the version control system.

Since the content of the `catch` block remains the same on both sides, the conflict is likely due to formatting rather than functional changes. Therefore, the code should be merged as-is, maintaining the existing structure and context without introducing any new changes.

```java
        parser.parseContOnError();
    }

    public void exec() throws Throwable {
        try {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        parser.setInteractive(false);
        parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            Exception pe = Utils.getPermissionException(e);
            if (pe != null)
                log.error("You don't have permission to perform the operation. Error from the server: " + pe.getMessage());
