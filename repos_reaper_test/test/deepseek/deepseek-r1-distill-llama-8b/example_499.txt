The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two lines where one uses `mBitmapTexture` and the other uses `mBitmapTextureAtlas`. The context indicates that the second variable is likely the correct one to use, as it's part of the Luminaries library's terminology for texture management. To resolve this, I'll choose the newer version with `mBitmapTextureAtlas` to maintain consistency and proper variable naming conventions.

```java
			this.mMusic.setLooping(true);
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}

<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTexture);
=======
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);

	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```
