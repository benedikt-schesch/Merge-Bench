The snippet has a merge conflict in the import statements. The left branch imports `com.restfb.json.Json` and `com.restfb.json.JsonValue`, while the right branch imports `com.restfb.json.JsonArray` and `com.restfb.json.JsonObject`. Since these are all distinct classes within the same package, they can be safely included together without causing duplication issues.

Final resolution: Merge both sets of imports as they do not conflict, resulting in all four imports being included.

```java
import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromLongFormat;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;

import com.restfb.Facebook;
import com.restfb.json.Json;
import com.restfb.json.JsonArray;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
import com.restfb.json.JsonValue;
