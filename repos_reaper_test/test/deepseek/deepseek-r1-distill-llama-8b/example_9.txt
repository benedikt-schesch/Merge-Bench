The merge conflict appears to involve a method removal and an added method. To resolve this, we should keep the version that reflects the current state where `disconnected()` has been removed, as indicated by the newer commit.

The resolved code will retain only the `getFileSystem()` implementation that exists in the newer commit, effectively removing the `disconnected()` method.

	public FileSystem getFileSystem() {
		return filesystem;

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
	public void disconnected() {
		stop("Disconnected for some unknown reason!");
