The selected code snippet includes two imports lists that appear to be part of a merge conflict. In Java, imports are considered non-executive and typically can coexist without conflicts since they don't interfere with each other. If both sets of imports are necessary for the application to function properly, they should both be preserved. If there's a specific conflict, it may be necessary to review the dependencies to ensure compatibility, but based on the provided information, the imports can be merged without modification.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
import org.apache.commons.configuration.CompositeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.ContentStore;
import org.jbake.app.FileUtil;
import org.jbake.template.model.TemplateModel;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.Writer;
