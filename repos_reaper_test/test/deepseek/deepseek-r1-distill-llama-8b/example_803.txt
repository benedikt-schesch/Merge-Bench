To resolve the merge conflict, we should include the version check to throw an exception for compatibility. This prevents incorrect usage when running with newer server versions that no longer support row locks.

```java
    return size;
  }

  /** Serializes this request.  */
  ChannelBuffer serialize(final byte server_version) {
    if (server_version >= RegionClient.CLIENT_VERSION_095_OR_ABOVE) {
      throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Row locks are not supported with"
                                      +" this version of HBase ("
                                      + server_version + ").");
    }
    final ChannelBuffer buf = newBuffer(server_version,
                                        predictSerializedSize());
    buf.writeInt(2);  // Number of parameters.

    writeHBaseByteArray(buf, region.name());
```
