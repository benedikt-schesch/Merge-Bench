The code includes two import statements that may be conflicting as they reference different packages. To resolve this, we should keep the necessary imports and remove any redundant ones. Based on the context, `org.jbake.model.DocumentModel` appears to be needed for the current file, so we'll keep that import. We'll remove `org.jbake.app.JBakeProperty` if it's not being used in the code.

```java
package org.jbake.template.model;

import org.jbake.app.ContentStore;
import org.jbake.app.DocumentList;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;

import java.util.Map;
```
