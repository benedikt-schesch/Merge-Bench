To resolve the merge conflict, ensure that the `@Getter`, `@Setter`, and `@Facebook` annotations are added to the `key` field, combining both sides of the conflict into a single consistent declaration.

```java

  }

  public static class KeyedType extends NamedFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

=======
    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    private String key;
