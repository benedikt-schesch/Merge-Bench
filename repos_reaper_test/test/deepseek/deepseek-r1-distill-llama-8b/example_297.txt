To resolve the merge conflict, we need to retain both necessary imports to maintain functionality.

The provided code snippet includes two imports required for the class. The first import, `com.mongodb.LazyDBObject;`, is necessary for creating instances of `LazyDBObject`.

import com.mongodb.LazyDBObject;
import org.bson.LazyBSONCallback;

import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.ByteOrder;

class LazyBsonDocument implements BsonDocument {
