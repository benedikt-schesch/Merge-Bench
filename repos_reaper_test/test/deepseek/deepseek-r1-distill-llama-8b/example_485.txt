Since both imports appear to be related to AndEngine's OpenGL utilities, but from potentially different versions of the library, it's unclear which one to keep. The import on the left (`GLState`) might be from an older version, while the one on the right (`VertexBufferObjectManager`) from a newer version. Without more context, it's ambiguous which should be retained. Therefore, either both should be checked for usage in the code to see if one can be safely removed, or further information is needed to resolve the conflict.

The code snippet remains unchanged as provided.

```java
import org.andengine.opengl.util.GLState;
import org.andengine.opengl.vbo.VertexBufferObjectManager;
import org.andengine.ui.activity.SimpleBaseGameActivity;
import org.andengine.util.modifier.ease.EaseQuadInOut;

import android.widget.Toast;
