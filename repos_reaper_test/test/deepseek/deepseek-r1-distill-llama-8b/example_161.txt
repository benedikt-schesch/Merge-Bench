This is a merge conflict that involves two different license blocks:
1. The upper block is the original and shows a different license (MIT License).
2. The lower block shows the Apache Software License, which seems to overwrite the previous one.

Potential issues:
- It's possible that there was an unintended change in the license, leading to a conflict.
- Both licenses can't apply to the same codebase, so this suggests a possible merge error.
- Without additional context, it's unclear which license is correct, so preserving both blocks would be necessary to resolve the merge conflict favourably.

Use insights:
- The original commit has a date of 2023-12-20 (from the lower block's hash: 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309) which indicates it was an older commit.
