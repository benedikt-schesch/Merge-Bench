The merge conflict is between a method declaration and its implementation. The solution is to preserve both changes by combining the method signature with its implementation.

The final code is:

```java
  protected LongAssert(Long actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, LongAssert.class, description);
  }

  public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected) {
    longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
```
