To resolve the merge conflict, the `learnerOption` should be updated to use `LocalLearner.class` based on the provided change. Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
	private Stream resultStream;

	private Instances dataset;

	public ClassOption learnerOption = new ClassOption("learner", 'l',
			"Classifier to train.", LocalLearner.class, SimpleClassifierAdapter.class.getName());
	
	private TopologyBuilder builder;

	private int parallelism;
```
