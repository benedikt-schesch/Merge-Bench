The merged comment should include elements from both sides: the Javadoc from one side and the @Facebook annotation from the other. The field keeps the name 'likes' and the annotations.

```java
   * The Pages that this Page Likes.
   * The number of likes the page has since version 2.6
   * @RestFB.GraphApi.Since 2.6
  @Facebook
  private Long likes;
```
