The merge conflict involves updating the comment for the `MUTATE` constant. It's a documentational change that adds context about compatibility with HBase 0.95, while keeping track of the introduction in the codebase with the `@since` tag. The resolution combines both additions into a single, comprehensive comment.

```java
  /**
   * Package-private interface to mark RPCs that are changing data in HBase.
   * @since 1.4
   *
   * **RPC method name to use with HBase 0.95+.

  /*
   * This class, although it's part of the public API, is mostly here to make
   * it easier for this library to manipulate the HBase RPC protocol.
