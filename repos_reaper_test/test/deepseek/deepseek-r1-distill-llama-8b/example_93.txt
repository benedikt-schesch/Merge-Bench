The code has conflicting constructor parameter lists, with one side having three parameters and the other having four. This can't be resolved automatically, so the snippet with the conflict is returned.

```java
  private final ConnectedUsers users;
  private final boolean gameChatEnabled;

  @Inject
  public GameChatHandler(final GameManager gameManager, final ChatFilter chatFilter,
                         final ConnectedUsers users) {
