The code snippet shows a merge conflict in the `text` assignment where two different versions of the string are present. The left side uses a `String.join` approach, while the right side uses an improved version with streams. The warning message has also changed in wording.

The change should be resolved by choosing one version. If the team prefers the improved wording and stream joining, the right side's version should be taken. If not, the original should remain. The potential issue is that these changes could affect the user experience, so confirmation about the intended wording and code style is essential.

The output includes the entire snippet with both versions to preserve context, as the conflict isn't clear. If the intention was to merge both changes, both would need to be integrated properly.
