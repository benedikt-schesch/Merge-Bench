The change involves a discrepancy in the `nodeCount` and `relCount` variables between two branches. Both values were likely updated to reflect new data or fixes. Since the remote branch's values (1854 and 2898) were committed, they should be chosen as the correct values.

	@Test
	public void testRebuildCommand() {

		final Console console = new Console(securityContext, ConsoleMode.JavaScript, Collections.emptyMap());
