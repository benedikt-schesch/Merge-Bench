I will merge the changes, incorporating the new variables from the branch while noting the potential legacy code that conflicts. Since the merge will likely keep the more complete version of the `CardStack` class, the `setMargins` method and `mStackMargin` might be considered legacy.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;


public class CardStack extends RelativeLayout {
    private boolean mEnableRotation;
    private int mGravity;
    private int mColor = -1;
    private int mIndex = 0;
    private int mNumVisible = 4;
    private boolean canSwipe = true;
    private ArrayAdapter<?> mAdapter;

    /** Legacy margin variable, may be removed in future versions */
    private int mStackMargin = DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN;

    public static final int DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN = 20;
