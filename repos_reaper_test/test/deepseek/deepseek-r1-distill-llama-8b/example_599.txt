To resolve the merge conflict, the class should be updated to include the new `Boolean breakfast` field with its getter and setter, replacing the existing `serialVersionUID` field. This change reflects the introduction of the new property as a JavaBean.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageRestaurantSpecialties extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
=======
    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private Boolean breakfast;
