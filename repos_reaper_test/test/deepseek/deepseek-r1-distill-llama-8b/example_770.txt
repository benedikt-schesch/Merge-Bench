To resolve the merge conflict, I analyze both versions of the comment. It's clear that the intents are to inform about default charset and provide detailed note on timestamp handling. The right side adds additional info beyond the charset note. I merge them into one coherent comment.

Here is the merged code:

```java
 * All strings are assumed to use the platform's default charset.
 * <h1>A note on passing {@code timestamp}s in argument</h1>
 * Irrespective of the order in which you send RPCs, a {@code DeleteRequest}
 * that is created with a specific timestamp in argument will only delete
 * values in HBase that were previously stored with a timestamp less than
 * or equal to that of the {@code DeleteRequest}.
 * However, if {@link #setDeleteAtTimestampOnly} is called, only the value at
 * the specified timestamp is deleted.
```
