1. `DatabaseHelper`: Maintained for database-related functionalities.
2. `TwitterDbAdapter`: Added for Twitter database-specific operations.
3. `ImageManager`: Included for image handling within the application.
4. `Preferences`: Imported for application preferences management.
5. `Weibo`: Included for Twitter integration within the application.
