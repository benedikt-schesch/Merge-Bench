To resolve the merge conflict, we will incorporate the changes from both sides. The right side introduces `mVoteTargetSpans` to store `URLSpan[]`, which is necessary for the new UI implementation. Meanwhile, `mVoteTargetCommentInfo` is no longer needed since it's been replaced by the more specific `mVoteTargetSpans`. Therefore, we'll merge by replacing the original declaration.

```java
    private int mNumVisibleComments;

    // UI State
    private View mVoteTargetView = null;
    private CommentInfo mVoteTargetCommentInfo = null;
    private URLSpan[] mVoteTargetSpans = null;
    
    // ProgressDialogs with percentage bars
    private AutoResetProgressDialog mLoadingCommentsProgress;
    
    /**
