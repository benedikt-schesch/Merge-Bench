The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict where there are two different implementations of a method. The first implementation uses `in.read()` while the second uses `in.skip()`. To resolve this, the `skip()` method should be used as it correctly moves the position by the number of bytes skipped.

The final merged code replaces the `read` method with the `skip` method to properly handle the position increment based on skipped bytes.

```java
public int read(byte b[], int off, int len) throws IOException {
    long rc = in.skip(len);
    pos += rc;
    return (int) rc;
}
