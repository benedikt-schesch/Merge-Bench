To resolve the merge conflict, both the assignment of `projectConfigurationManager` and the registration of the listener are necessary. They should both be executed in the correct order, ensuring that the `projectConfigurationManager` is available when the listener is registered. Therefore, the final code will include both statements in the appropriate sequence.

```java
		buildService.setJdk(jdk);
		
		listener = new DummyAndroidBuildListener();

		registry.registerBuildListener(listener);
		
		projectConfigurationManager = MavenPlugin.getProjectConfigurationManager();
    }

	@Override
	protected void tearDown() throws Exception {
		listener.clear();
```
