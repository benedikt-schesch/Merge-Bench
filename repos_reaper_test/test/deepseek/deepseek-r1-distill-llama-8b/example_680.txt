I'll choose the version with the improved formatting that sorts and links to the documentation, as it appears to be a better implementation. The changes maintain the same message with better phrasing and a proper link.

Here's the merged result:

```java
			applyConfigurationFileIfExists(ctx, postDeployConfFile, DEPLOYMENT_IMPORT_STATUS);

			if (!missingPrincipals.isEmpty()) {

				final String title = "Missing Principal(s)";
<<<<<<< HEAD
				final String text = "The following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for resource access permissions or node ownership during <b>deployment</b>.<br>"
						+ "Because of these missing permissions/ownerships, <b>the functionality is not identical to the export you just imported</b>"
						+ "<ul><li>" + String.join("</li><li>",  missingPrincipals) + "</li></ul>";
