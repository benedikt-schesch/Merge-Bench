The code has a conflict where both sides declare a field named `mBitmapTexture` with different types. The left side declares it as `BitmapTexture` while the right side declares it as `BitmapTextureAtlas`. This indicates that there's an inconsistency between the two branches in the version control system.

To resolve this, it's best to decide based on the more up-to-date implementation. If `BitmapTextureAtlas` is the newer approach intended for use, then keep that declaration and optionally mark `BitmapTexture` as deprecated if necessary. Alternatively, if both are needed, they can be renamed to avoid duplication.

**Clipboard Hint:** Decide whether to keep or remove `BitmapTexture` based on project requirements and the intended functionality.

The resolved code should include either one of the lines or both, depending on the intended use. For context, the following fields are included as they appear in the current version:

```java
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================
	// ===========================================================
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
	private TiledTextureRegion mBoxFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mCircleFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mTriangleFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mHexagonFaceTextureRegion;
	// ===========================================================
