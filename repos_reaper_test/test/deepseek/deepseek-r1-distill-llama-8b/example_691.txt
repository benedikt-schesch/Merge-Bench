The merge conflict here involves a change to the `successNotificationsDelayProperty` declaration. On one branch, it's declared as an `IntProperty` with a default value of 5000, while the other branch removes the property entirely. The right side likely intends to use a StringProperty instead.

Here's how to resolve the conflict by aligning both sides to use `StringProperty` with an appropriate default:

```java
	public static final Property<String> successNotificationsDelayProperty  = new StringProperty("successNotificationsDelay").hint("Delay in milliseconds").defaultValue("5000").partOfBuiltInSchema();
```
