The conflict involves the type of the `deferred` variable, with one side using `Deferred` and the other using a generic `Deferred<?>`. Since the context indicates a more flexible requirement, the correct choice is `Deferred<?>`.

```java

  /** The RPC that was failed with this exception.  */
  private final HBaseRpc rpc;

  /** A deferred one can wait on before retrying the failed RPC.  */
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private final Deferred deferred;
=======
  private final Deferred<?> deferred;

  /**
   * Constructor.
   * @param msg A message explaining why the application has to throttle.
   * @param cause The exception that requires the application to throttle
