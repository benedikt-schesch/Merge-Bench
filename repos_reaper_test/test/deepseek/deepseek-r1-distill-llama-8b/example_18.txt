The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict where there are two different declarations for `snapshotManager`. The first declaration in the context has a different access modifier (`protected`) compared to the second context. Additionally, the second snippet introduces additional fields that were not present in the first.

To resolve this, the appropriate action is to merge these changes by keeping the necessary fields and ensuring consistent access modifiers. The `SnapshotableLinkedHashMap` requires access to `snapshotManager`, so it should remain private to maintain encapsulation. The `protected` access in the first context is removed to prevent unnecessary exposure.

```java
	private final PluginManager pluginManager = new PluginManager(this, securityManager, 0.0);
	private final ConsoleManager consoleManager;
	private final EventManager eventManager = new SimpleEventManager();
	private final RecipeManager recipeManager = new RecipeManager();
	private final ServiceManager serviceManager = new ServiceManager();
	private final SnapshotableLinkedHashMap<String, SpoutPlayer> players = new SnapshotableLinkedHashMap<String, SpoutPlayer>(snapshotManager);
	private final WorldGenerator defaultGenerator = new WorldGenerator();
	/** @deprecated */
	@Rem ArithmeticExpression()
	protected final SpoutSessionRegistry sessions = new SpoutSessionRegistry();
	private final SpoutScheduler scheduler = new SpoutScheduler(this);
	private final SpoutParallelTaskManager parallelTaskManager = new SpoutParallelTaskManager(this);
	private final AtomicBoolean setupComplete = new AtomicBoolean(false);
	private final SpoutConfiguration config = new SpoutConfiguration();
	private final SpoutInputConfiguration inputConfig = new SpoutInputConfiguration();
