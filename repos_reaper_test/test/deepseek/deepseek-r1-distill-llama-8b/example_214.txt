I notice there is a method name conflict between two branches. One branch has `testGroupReorderCount()` and the other has `testSimpleCount()`. It's unclear which functionality each method is intended to test, but since they are different, both method names should remain as is in their respective branches. Here is the full context:

```java
        tmpFile.delete();
        
    }
    
    @Test
<<<<<<< HEAD
    public void testGroupReorderCount() throws Throwable {
=======
    public void testSimpleCount() throws Exception {
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
        for (int i = 0; i < nullFlags.length; i++) {
            System.err.println("Testing testSimpleCount with null flag:" + nullFlags[i]);
        
            PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(tmpFile));
```
