The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict between two changes. The `SharedPreferences` declaration is present in one version but missing in the other. To resolve this, the version from the common ancestor should be retained, and the later modification with the `BroadcastReceiver` should be considered based on the project's requirements.

```java
    private Timer mBackgroundTimer;
    private String mBackgroundImageUrl;
    private ArrayObjectAdapter mAdapter;
    private CardPresenter mCardPresenter;
    private TvShowsCardPresenter mTvShowsCardPresenter;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private SharedPreferences mSharedPreferences;
=======
    private SharedPreferences mSharedPreferences; 
    private BroadcastReceiver videoUpdateReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
        @Override
        public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
            Bundle bundle = intent.getExtras();
