The conflict involves changes made to two different set of fields in the class. The left side of the conflict adds or modifies `mRadarPointTextureRegion` and `mRadarTextureRegion`, while the right side adds `mFont`, `Location mUserLocation`, and changes `mFontBitmapTexture` to `mFontTexture`. 

Since these are additions or renames to different fields, they can coexist without conflict. The right side introduces a new `Font` field and renames `mFontBitmapTexture` to `mFontTexture` to potentially reflect a better naming convention. The left side might be adding radar-related texture regions which can coexist with the font-related changes.
