To resolve the merge conflict, the goal is to select the best version based on standard conventions. The right side includes the period at the end of the @return line, which is more grammatically correct. The @param line remains consistent as there was no conflict there.

```java
     * @param string
     *            a string reference to check
     * 
     * @return {@code true} if the string is null or is the empty string.

    public static boolean isNullOrEmpty(String string) {
        return string == null || string.isEmpty();
    }
