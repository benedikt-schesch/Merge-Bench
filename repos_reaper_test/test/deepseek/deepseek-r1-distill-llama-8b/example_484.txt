The code shows a simple import statement conflict where an additional import is added in the second version but not in the first. Since both imports are necessary for the functionality, resolving the conflict by including both imports is appropriate.

```java
import org.andengine.engine.options.resolutionpolicy.RatioResolutionPolicy;
import org.andengine.opengl.vbo.VertexBufferObjectManager;
import org.andengine.entity.primitive.Line;
import org.andengine.entity.scene.Scene;
import org.andengine.entity.scene.background.Background;
import org.andengine.entity.util.FPSLogger;
