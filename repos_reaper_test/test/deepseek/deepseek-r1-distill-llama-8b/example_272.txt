The code snippet shows a merge conflict in the `pkgr.setKeyType` line where two different versions of the ternary condition are used. The left side uses the shorter version without parentheses, while the right side includes parentheses for clarity. Both versions are functionally equivalent and only differ in formatting style. Since the intentions are to set the key type based on the condition, the parentheses can be added for improved readability, so the right side is the better choice.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
        }

        POPackage pkg = new POPackage(new OperatorKey(scope,
                nig.getNextNodeId(scope)));
        LitePackager pkgr = new LitePackager();
