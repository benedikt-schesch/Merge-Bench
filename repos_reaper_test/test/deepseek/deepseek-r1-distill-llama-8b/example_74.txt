The code snippet shows a conflict between two different service provider field names. The left side has `customDecksServiceProvider` with a comment about timer updates, while the right side is `cardcastServiceProvider`. To resolve this, we need to determine which name is correct or if there's a typo.

- **Possible Resolution A**: Assume `customDecksServiceProvider` is the intended name and correct the code to match the comment.
- **Possible Resolution B**: Assume the field was renamed and update the comment to reflect the new name.

Given the context, the comment's wording doesn't directly relate to the service provider. It seems the service name was recently changed, so the comment is still referring to the old name. Therefore, I'll update the code to match the comment.

**Answer:**

```java
  /**
   * Lock to prevent missing timer updates.
   */
  private final Provider<CustomCardsService> customDecksServiceProvider;
  private final Provider<CardcastService> cardcastServiceProvider;
  private final Provider<String> uniqueIdProvider;
  private Player host;
  private BlackDeck blackDeck;
  private BlackCard blackCard;
  private WhiteDeck whiteDeck;
```
