The code snippet shows a merge conflict in the `toArray()` method usage. Both sides of the merge attempt to convert the `players` list to an array, but with different array sizes. The left side uses `players.size()` to determine the array size, while the right side uses 0. Using `new Player[0]` could cause an exception if the list isn't empty. The left side is correct as it ensures the array is the right size.

```java
   *
   * @return Player information for every player in this game: Name, score, status.
   */
  public List<Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object>> getAllPlayerInfo() {
    final List<Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object>> info;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[players.size()]);
    info = new ArrayList<Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object>>(playersCopy.length);
=======
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    info = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);

    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      final Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object> playerInfo = getPlayerInfo(player);
      info.add(playerInfo);
    }
    return info;
