To resolve the merge conflict, we'll incorporate both intent's logic by introducing the conditional check to ensure `myDecoderView` is not null before starting the camera, making the code more robust.

```java
  }

  @Override protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    
    if (myDecoderView != null) {
      myDecoderView.startCamera();
    }
  }

  @Override protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
```
