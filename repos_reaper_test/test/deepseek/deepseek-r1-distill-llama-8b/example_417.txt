To resolve the merge conflict, both import statements from the same package are allowed in Java. However, it's possible that there was a class renaming. The correct import to keep depends on which class the code actually needs. Since I can't determine that from the provided snippet, here's the conflict as it is.

```java
package org.jbake.app;

import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.PropertyList;
import org.json.simple.JSONArray;
import org.json.simple.JSONObject;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Rule;
```
