The code is a merge conflict in a Java file where two different SpriteBatch instantiations are conflicting. The left side uses `mBitmapTexture` while the right side uses `mBitmapTextureAtlas`. To resolve this, we should determine the correct constructor parameter to use.

The `SpriteBatch` constructor being used in the right side (`this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, 2`) is likely the correct one because `mBitmapTextureAtlas` is a common variable used for BatchOperations. The right side also provides an anonymous class with the correct `onDrawSpriteBatch` method override.

The final merged code correctly uses `mBitmapTextureAtlas` and maintains the correct batch operation setup.

```java
		faceSprite1.setScale(2);
		faceSprite2.setRotation(45);

		/* Create the face and add it to the scene. */
<<<<<<< HEAD
		final SpriteBatch dynamicSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTexture, 2) {
=======
		final SpriteBatch dynamicSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, 2) {

			@Override
			public void onDrawSpriteBatch() {
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
				this.draw(faceSprite2);
			}
```
