The code snippet shows a merge conflict in a Java file where two versions have different line breaks around the closing curly brace. The correct approach is to place the closing brace on its own line to comply with Java formatting standards.

```java
  }

  public void removeMessageTag(MessageTag messageTag) {
    messageTags.remove(messageTag);
  }
=======
  }

  public void removeMessageTag(MessageTag messageTag) {
    messageTags.remove(messageTag);
  }
