To resolve the merge conflict, the key is to ensure that the imports are correctly ordered without any standalone comments disrupting them. The @Before method should be properly placed within the class with its Javadoc.

The fixed code should have the necessary imports and a correctly structured @Before method:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.spy;
import org.junit.Rule;

class TestClass {
    /**
     * @Before
     */
    @Before
    void setup() {
        // Test setup code
    }
}
```
