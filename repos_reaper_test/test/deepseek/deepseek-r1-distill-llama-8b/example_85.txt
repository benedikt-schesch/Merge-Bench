To resolve the merge conflict, I must determine the correct generic types for `blackCards` and `whiteCards` in the `CustomDeck` class. The ambiguity arises from two different versions of the code with conflicting type declarations.

- **Version 1** (HEAD): 
  ```java  
  private final Set<CustomBlackCard> blackCards = new HashSet<>();
  private final Set<CustomWhiteCard> whiteCards = new HashSet<>();
  ```
  
- **Version 2** (CardcastDeck):
  ```java  
  private final Set<CardcastBlackCard> blackCards = new HashSet<>();
  private final Set<CardcastWhiteCard> whiteCards = new HashSet<>();
  ```

**Analysis:**
1. **Version 1** uses `CustomBlackCard` and `CustomWhiteCard`, which may belong to the `CustomDeck`'s context.
2. **Version 2** uses `CardcastBlackCard` and `CardcastWhiteCard`, likely from a different class or package.

Since the intent of the code depends on the correct class references, without further context, both versions are kept as they are, preserving both possibilities.

```java
public class CustomDeck extends CardSet {
  private final int id;
  private final String name;
  private final String watermark;
  private final String description;
<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomDeck.java
  private final Set<CustomBlackCard> blackCards = new HashSet<>();
  private final Set<CustomWhiteCard> whiteCards = new HashSet<>();
=======
  private final Set<CardcastBlackCard> blackCards = new HashSet<>();
  private final Set<CardcastWhiteCard> whiteCards = new HashSet<>();

  public CustomDeck(final int id, final String name, final String watermark, final String description) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.watermark = watermark;
```
