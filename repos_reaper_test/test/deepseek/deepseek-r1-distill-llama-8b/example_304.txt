```java
	CLUSIVE merged the changes:

- Conflicting lines: 4 (Calendar birthday = ...;)
The changes involve both the date and timezone. The right-hand side sets a more specific and likely correctly intended date in Sao Paulo timezone. Keep the right-hand side.

Full Snippet:
```java
		assertThat(deserialized[0], is(instanceOf(Dog.class)));
		Dog dog = (Dog) deserialized[0];
		assertThat(dog.name, is("Brutus"));
		assertThat(dog.age, is(7));

		Calendar birthday = new GregorianCalendar(2011, 03, 04);//04/04/2011
		birthday.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("America/Sao_Paulo"));
		assertThat(dog.birthday, is(birthday));

		@Test
	public void shouldHonorRequestHeaderAcceptCharset() throws Exception {
```
