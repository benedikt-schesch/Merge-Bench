The merge conflict occurs because one side has the method signature without the implementation, while the other includes the method body. The correct approach is to merge the complete method with the implementation. 

The resolved code should include the method body to ensure the functionality is preserved.

```java
   *
   * @param type       Type of message to broadcast. This determines the order the messages are returned by
   *                   priority.
   * @param masterData Message data to broadcast.
   */
  public void broadcastToPlayers(final MessageType type,
                                 final HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> masterData) {
    connectedUsers.broadcastToList(playersToUsers(), type, masterData);
  }

  /**
   * Sends updated player information about a specific player to all players in the game.
```
