The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict in the Javadoc comments and method signature. Specifically, there is a discrepancy in the presence of the `@Beta` annotation.

Here is the full context of the conflict:

Left version (from HEAD):
```java
     *     or {@link SecurityUtils#loadKeyStoreFromCertificates})
     * @param mtlsKeyStore key store for client certificate and key to establish mutual TLS. (use
     *     for example {@link SecurityUtils#createMtlsKeyStore(InputStream)})
     * @param mtlsKeyStorePassword password for mtlsKeyStore parameter
     * @Beta
```

Right version (from branch 51762f221ec8ab38da03149c8012e63aec0433dc):
```java
     *     or {@link SecurityUtils#loadKeyStoreFromCertificates})
     * @param mtlsKeyStore key store for client certificate and key to establish mutual TLS. (use
     *     for example {@link SecurityUtils#createMtlsKeyStore(InputStream)})
     * @param mtlsKeyStorePassword password for mtlsKeyStore parameter
```

The conflict is on the line following the parameter documentation. The `@Beta` annotation appears in the left version but is missing in the right version. Without additional context, the intent behind this change is unclear, so the conflict should be preserved as-is.
