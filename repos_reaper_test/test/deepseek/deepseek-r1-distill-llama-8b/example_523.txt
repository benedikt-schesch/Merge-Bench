Since the code snippet shows conflicting changes where one branch includes variable initializations and a comment about IE8, while the other includes a constructor comment, it's clear both sides have different intentions. It's ambiguous whether to keep the initial values or focus on the constructor. Therefore, the conflict remains as it is.

```java
    private String code = null;
    private int options = 1;
    private String mhtmlRoot = "";
    private String outputFilename = "";
    private int maxUriLength = DEFAULT_MAX_URI_LENGTH;  //IE8 only allows dataURIs up to 32KB
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private int maxImageSize;
