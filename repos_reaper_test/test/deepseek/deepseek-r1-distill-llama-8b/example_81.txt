The code is a merge conflict between two versions of the `getString2()` method in an enum. The first change declares the method as `public`, while the second omits the access modifier. Since enums require explicit method declarations, the correct approach is to keep the public access. 

The second version likely attempted to make it non-public, but enums can't have abstract methods inherited from interfaces. Therefore, the correct method should retain the public modifier. 

To resolve this, the line should be kept as `public String getString2();` to preserve public access and prevent compilation errors.

Answer: `public String getString2();`
