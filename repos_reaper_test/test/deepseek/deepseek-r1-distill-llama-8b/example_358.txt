To resolve the merge conflict, we need to ensure that both code paths produce consistent and reliable output. The existing implementation already correctly uses the `JsonFactory` provider. Therefore, the provided code snippet reflects the most recent and accurate approach.

Here's the final code:

```java
  public <T> T parse(HttpResponse response, Class<T> dataClass) throws IOException {
    return parserForResponse(jsonFactory, response).parseAndClose(dataClass, null);
  }
```

This change ensures consistency in how the JSON parsing is handled across the codebase and leverages the provided `JsonFactory` for creating parsers.
