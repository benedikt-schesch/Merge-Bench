The given problem involves resolving a merge conflict between two versions of a Java import statement. The left side only imports `com.restfb.json.JsonObject.NULL`, while the right side includes several additional static imports.

To resolve this, I combined both sets of imports to include all necessary dependencies without duplications. The result preserves the original import of `JsonObject.NULL` while additional static imports are included to enhance functionality.
