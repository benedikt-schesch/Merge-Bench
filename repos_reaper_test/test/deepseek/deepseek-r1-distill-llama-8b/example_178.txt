To resolve the merge conflict, I need to consider the imports from both sides. The right side added `Collection` and removed `OutputStream` and `PrintStream`, which might indicate that these classes are no longer needed. The left side requires them, so they should be included. 

Here's how the code would look after merging:

```java
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Collection;
import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.OperatorPlan;
import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.VisitorException;
import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.PlanException;
```
