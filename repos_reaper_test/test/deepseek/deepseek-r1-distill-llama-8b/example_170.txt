The conflict involves two different Javadoc comments for the same method, `openDFSFile()`. Resolving the merge requires combining the intentions of both sides while preserving the content and correct Javadoc formatting. The left side has a concise comment, while the right side provides more details including parameter documentation. Therefore, the comments are combined to include both summaries and parameters.

```java
    /**
     * This function is meant to be used if the mappers/reducers want to access any HDFS file
     * @param fileName
     * @return InputStream of the open file.
     * @throws IOException
     */
    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        SliceWrapper wrapper = PigInputFormat.getActiveSplit();

        if (wrapper == null)
