To resolve the merge conflict, I analyzed both sides of the change. The right side initializes the GruntParser with only a StringReader and adds additional settings, making it more complete. The left side adds an extra parameter, which might be necessary for specific functionality but hasn't been properly integrated. For a clean resolution, the right side's changes are more recent and likely the correct approach.

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "explain b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";
