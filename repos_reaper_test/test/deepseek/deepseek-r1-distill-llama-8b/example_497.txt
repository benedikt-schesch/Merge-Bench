To resolve the conflict by selecting the second version:

The field `mBitmapTexture` is renamed to `mBitmapTextureAtlas`, and `mFaceTextureRegion` is added. This aligns with the pattern of other fields.

```java
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================
	
	private Camera mCamera;
	
<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private int mFaceIDCounter;
	private final SparseArray<Sprite> mFaces = new SparseArray<Sprite>();
```
