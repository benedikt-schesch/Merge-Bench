To resolve the merge conflict, I examined both sides of the code. The left side checks for screen names, while the right performs a more comprehensive check for mentions. However, since the type used on the right is "mention" instead of the enum, it's unclear. I'll prefer the right side as it might better capture mentions but note that the type may need adjustment if "mention" isn't appropriate.

```java
    List<Entity> extracted = new ArrayList<Entity>();
    Matcher matcher = Regex.VALID_MENTION_OR_LIST.matcher(text);
    while (matcher.find()) {
      String after = text.substring(matcher.end());
<<<<<<< HEAD
      if (! Regex.SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END.matcher(after).find()) {
        extracted.add(new Entity(matcher, EntityType.MENTION, Regex.EXTRACT_MENTIONS_GROUP_USERNAME));
=======
      if (! Regex.INVALID_MENTION_MATCH_END.matcher(after).find()) {
        extracted.add(new Entity(matcher, "mention", Regex.VALID_MENTION_OR_LIST_GROUP_USERNAME));

    }
    return extracted;
  }
