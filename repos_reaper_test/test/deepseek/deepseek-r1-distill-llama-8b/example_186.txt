The code snippet provided shows a merge conflict where two different sets of imports are being applied. The left side has imports from the `java.util` package, while the right side has imports specific to the `org.apache.pig` package. This suggests that the file was restructured into a new package directory. To resolve the conflict, we need to align the imports with the correct package structure.

To fix the conflict, the necessary changes include:
1. Updating the package declaration in both files to reflect their new package structure.
2. Removing outdated imports and adding the appropriate package imports based on the new structure.

Since the tasks are to keep the provided context intact and not modify anything incorrectly, I will present the adjusted package declaration for clarity.

```java
package org.apache.pig.impl.plan;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Properties;
=======
import java.util.HashMap;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309:src/org/apache/pig/impl/plan/NodeIdGenerator.java
import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.sw Split point? The code snippet shows that the StarSpec.java file is now in the new package structure and should have the appropriate imports.

The correct way to present this in markdown:

```
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD:src/org/apache/pig/impl/eval/StarSpec.java
package org.apache.pig.impl.eval;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Properties;
=======
package org.apache.pig.impl.plan;

import java.util.HashMap;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309:src/org/apache/pig/impl/plan/NodeIdGenerator.java
import java.util.Map;
```
