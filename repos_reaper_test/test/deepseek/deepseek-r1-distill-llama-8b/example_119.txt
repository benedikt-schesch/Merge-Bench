The code shows a merge conflict between two different Material Design library imports. To resolve this, the project needs to use either:

`com.afollestad.material-dialogs`  
or  
`com.google.android.material:material-design`

To choose which import to keep, it's recommended to align with the rest of the codebase or project requirements. If updating to the newer Material Design library (`com.google.android.material:material-design`), remove the existing import and keep the line from the other side of the conflict. If the project specifically requires `MaterialDialog` from `com.afollestad_material-dialogs`, keep that import instead.

For this example, I'll keep the import from the main branch and remove the conflicting import from the feature branch by restoring the original state:

```java
import android.text.TextUtils;
import android.text.TextWatcher;
import android.view.Menu;
import android.view.MenuItem;
import android.widget.Toast;
```
