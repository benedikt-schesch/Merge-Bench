To resolve the merge conflict, we need to choose which assertion method to use. The `assertEquals` method is the newer approach and is likely intended for use in both tests. Thus, the code will be updated to use `assertEquals` in both cases.

```java
  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_fallback() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.json", attachmentData.getBytes());
    assertEquals("application/octet-stream", att.getContentType());
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_manual() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
```
