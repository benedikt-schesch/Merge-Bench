The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two versions of imports in a Java file. The left side imports `java.util.Collection` and `java.util.HashMap`, while the right side imports `java.util.List`, `java.util.Map`, and several `java.util.regex` classes. To resolve this, the right side's imports are kept because they are more specific and use parameterized types, avoiding raw types which can lead to potential type safety issues. The left's imports are either redundant or unnecessary since the right side provides better imports for the classes used. Additionally, the right side includes necessary imports for regex operations which are not present on the left.

Here is the merged code with all necessary imports:

```java
import com.google.common.base.Objects;
import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;
import com.google.common.collect.Iterables;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
```
