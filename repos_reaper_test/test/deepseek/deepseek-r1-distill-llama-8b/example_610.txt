To resolve the merge conflict, both fields are kept to maintain compatibility and new functionality. The `serialVersionUID` remains for old versions, and `year` is added with annotations for new introductions.

```java
    private PageStartDate date;
  }

  public static class PageStartDate extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
