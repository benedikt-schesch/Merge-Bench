To resolve the merge conflict, we combine the two sides by implementing the conditional assignment from the right side while preserving the initial assignment from the left, ensuring proper behavior when dealing with CBZip2InputStream.

```java
    long pos;
    InputStream in;
    final int bufSize = 1024;
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in, long pos) {
        if (in instanceof CBZip2InputStream) {
            this.in = in;
        } else {
            this.in = new BufferedInputStream(in, bufSize);
        }
        this.pos = pos;
    }
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in){
        this(in,0);
```
