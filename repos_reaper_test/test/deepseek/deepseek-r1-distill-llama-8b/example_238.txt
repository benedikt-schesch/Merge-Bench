The code snippet shows a licensing conflict between two different licenses in the same file, indicating a potential merge conflict in a version control system. The file on the local branch uses the BSD License, while the commit from another branch uses the Apache Software License. 

Since both branches have their own license headers but they are different, this could indicate a need for further analysis or discussion to determine the correct approach forward. To resolve this, it might be necessary to consolidate the licenses or clarify which one should be used.

Here are the conflicting snippets:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD

This conflict suggests that the files might have different licensing considerations or the project might need to adopt a single license to maintain consistency. Further investigation or a decision on the appropriate approach is recommended.
