The changes reflect an improvement in the warning message to ensure clarity and urgency while maintaining the essential information about multiple principals. Sorting the list improves readability and the use of an exclamation point emphasizes the importance of resolving the issue. The message is now more assertive while also being grammatically correct. The log statement has a consistent structure with the title included for clarity.

```java

		if (!ambiguousPrincipals.isEmpty()) {
