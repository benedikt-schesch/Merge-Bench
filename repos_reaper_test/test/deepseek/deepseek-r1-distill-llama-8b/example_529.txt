The code appears to be performing a binary search on a linked list where the `\` indicates a merge conflict. The left side uses `null` for the termination condition, while the right side uses `nil`. Since `nil` is not valid in Java, the left side should be preserved.

```java
		while (u != null) {
			int comp = c.compare(x, u.x);
			if (comp < 0) 
				u = u.left;
			else if (comp > 0)
				u = u.right;
			else
				return u.x;
```
