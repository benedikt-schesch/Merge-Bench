To resolve the merge conflict, we'll merge the imports while keeping all necessary ones and removing duplicates. The left side's imports are kept as they might be used elsewhere, and the right side's imports are added where necessary.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import org.spout.api.command.CommandSource;
import org.spout.api.command.annotated.AnnotatedCommandExecutorFactory;
import org.spout.api.event.EventManager;
import org.spout.api.event.server.permissions.PermissionGetAllWithNodeEvent;
import org.spout.api.event.world.WorldLoadEvent;
import org.spout.api.event.world.WorldUnloadEvent;
import org.spout.api.exception.ConfigurationException;
import org.spout.api.exception.SpoutRuntimeException;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Point;
import org.spout.api.geo.Region;
import org.spout.api.inventory(recipe).RecipeManager;
```

This way, all imports from both sides are combined without duplication while preserving the necessary dependencies.
