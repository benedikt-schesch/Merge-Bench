The provided code has a merge conflict between two versions of a Javadoc comment for the getData() method. The first version (marked with HEAD) is a simple comment with a @return tag, while the second version includes additional @param and @throws tags along with a more detailed description.

To resolve this, I will preserve the more detailed Javadoc as it provides more complete documentation.

```java
  private List<Comment> data = new ArrayList<Comment>();

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  /**
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
   * The comments.
   *
   * @return The comments.
   * @param the comments
   * @throws an exception of type java.lang.IllegalStateException if there is an error
   */
  public List<Comment> getData() {
