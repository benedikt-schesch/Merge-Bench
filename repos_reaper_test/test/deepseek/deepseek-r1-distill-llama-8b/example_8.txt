The discrepancy lies in differing imports and conflicting class structure. The left side has PluginDictionary, the right has PluginLoader. I'll harmonize the imports and apply changes from both sides.

--- Here's how I would resolve the merge conflict ---

```java
import org.spout.api.Engine;
import org.spout.api.Spout;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Protocol;
import org.spout.api.plugin.Plugin;
import org.spout.api.plugin.PluginDictionary;
import org.spout.api.plugin.PluginLoader;

public final class SpoutMetaPlugin extends Plugin {
    private PluginDescriptionFile pdf;
    private Engine engine;
    private PluginDictionary dictionary; // TODO extend this dictionary to load translation from a different location
    private File file;
    
    public SpoutMetaPlugin(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
        file = new File(engine.getClass().getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().getPath().replaceAll("%20", " "));
    }
}
```
