The code presents a conflict between two sets of import statements. The first imports are from the Yahoo Labs SamOA project, while the second set is from the JavaCliparser library. Without more context, both could be essential, but one might be a mistake or outdated. Assuming the merge should keep the more relevant or necessary imports, likely the JavaCliparser imports are retained. 

```java
import com.github.javacliparser.ClassOption;
import com.github.javacliparser.FlagOption;
import com.github.javacliparser.IntOption;
import com.github.javacliparser.Option;
