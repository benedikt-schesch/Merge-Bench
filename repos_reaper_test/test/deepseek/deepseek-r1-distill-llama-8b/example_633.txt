The merge conflict involves the type of list for the `work` variable. The left side uses `List<WorkExperience>` and the right side uses `List<Work>`. In Java, generic types must match when merging, so I need to determine which type to use. Since the context only shows this snippet, I cannot know the intended type. To resolve this, I will choose the type from one side or the other. Since the right side's type `Work` might be more recent or correct, I will use that.

Final resolution: `List<Work>`.

```java

  @Facebook
  private List<UserDevice> devices = new ArrayList<UserDevice>();

  @Facebook
  private List<Work> work = new ArrayList<Work>();
  
  @Facebook
  private List<Education> education = new ArrayList<Education>();

  @Facebook
