After analyzing the merge conflict, the changes involve renaming a variable and adding new fields. The correct approach is to include both the variable renaming and the added fields to resolve the conflict by merging the later changes.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
  private final ConnectedUsers connectedUsers;
  private final GameManager gameManager;
  private final Provider<Session> sessionProvider;
  private final Object blackCardLock = new Object();
  private final GameOptions options;
  private final Set<String> cardcastDeckIds = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());
  private final Metrics metrics;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showGameLinkProvider;
  private final Provider<String> gamePermalinkFormatProvider;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showRoundLinkProvider;
```
