The merge conflict arises from a comment change but the code remains identical. The right side's comment is updated, likely to correct a typo from "absolute" to "file's path." Since the code logic hasn't changed, the comment should be updated as shown on the right. 

The resolved code preserves the functionality while fixing the comment.

```java
        if (requestCode != TLOG_PICKER_REQUEST_CODE || resultCode != RESULT_OK) {
            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, returnIntent);
            return;
        }

        // Get the file's path from the incoming intent
        final String tlogAbsolutePath = returnIntent.getStringExtra(ServiceDataContract.EXTRA_TLOG_ABSOLUTE_PATH);

        if (tlogOpener != null)
            tlogOpener.cancel(true);
```
