The code shows a rename of the method to better reflect its purpose of not responding to post-change events. I'll apply this rename and keep the logic whitespace clean.

```java
		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

	@Test
	public void shouldNotRespondToPostChangeEvents() {
		// The method was renamed to reflect the intention of not responding to post-change events
		// This aligns with the logic that prefers responding to post-build events instead
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, POST_CHANGE, AUTO_BUILD, null);
		assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event));

		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}
```
