The provided code appears to contain a merge conflict between two different branches in a version control system. One side contains an `if-else` block that conditionally appends a `spannable` to `mTextView`, while the other side appears to be incomplete or lacks the `if-else` structure but includes additional lines. The key is to reconcile these changes while maintaining the logical flow and correct behavior.

To resolve the merge conflict, align both branches to include both the `if-else` logic and the subsequent lines that set `textSize` and append a newline. This ensures that the `if-else` logic correctly determines when to update the text and then applies any necessary styling or additional content afterward.

```java
            mTextView.setText(mTextView.getEditableText().delete(0, mTextView.getText().toString().split("\n", 2)[0].length()+1));
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        } else {
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        }
        mTextView.setTextSize(mOptions.textSize);
        mTextView.append("\n");
    }

    @Override
```
