The code shows a merge conflict between two different methods:
1. On the left (`<<<<<<Â»: `public ShortAssert isNotEqualTo(short expected) {`), someone added a method `assertSame` and returned `this`.
2. On the right (`>>>>>>>>`, `public ShortAssert isNotEqualTo(short expected) {`), the same method was present but later conflicting with a new method.

Since both methods are independent, the conflict is likely due to parallel edits. The methods can be both kept If both are needed.

To resolve, include both; they are separate methods.

```java

    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
