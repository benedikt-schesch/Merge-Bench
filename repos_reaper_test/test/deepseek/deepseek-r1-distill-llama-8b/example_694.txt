To resolve the merge conflict, I analyzed the code and determined that the `fire-event` case should be included, and the `inline-text-message` case should be removed as it's no longer needed. Thus, the resolved code includes only the `fire-event` case from the other branch.

```java
					out.append(" data-structr-failure-notifications-custom-dialog-element=\"").append(generateDataAttributesForIdList(renderContext, triggeredAction, ActionMapping.failureNotificationElements)).append("\"");
					break;

				case "fire-event":
					out.append(" data-structr-failure-notifications-event=\"").append(triggeredAction.getProperty(ActionMapping.failureNotificationsEventProperty)).append("\"");
					break;

				default:
					break;
```
