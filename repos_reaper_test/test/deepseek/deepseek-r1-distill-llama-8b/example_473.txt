The code shows a merge conflict between two different import statements, which is a common issue after a file has been changed by two different committing users with differing needs.

The left side of the conflict has the test-related imports, while the right side adds project-specific imports. Both are necessary for the file to compile and function.

To resolve this, we can simply include all the required imports in the file once, as they are necessary for different purposes. There's no need to try removing any of them since all are needed for functionally.

The full package imports would be:

- `org.testng.annotations.*` (including `BeforeMethod` and `Test`)
- `de.javakaffee.web.msm.*` (including all necessary classes and interfaces)
- Any other imports required for the application to compile and function correctly

In code form, we include all necessary imports without duplications.
