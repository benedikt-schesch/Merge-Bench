To resolve the merge conflict, we should include the "return this;" statement to maintain the fluent interface, ensuring that the method can be chained. There's no conflict in intent here; the correct change is adding the return statement.

```java
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
```
