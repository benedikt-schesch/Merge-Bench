I am able to resolve the semantic conflict by:

RETAINING the code from the second commit HEAD

REASONS:
The second version lacks the isEmpty() check to allow for potential future usage of the service which may require the parameter injection even when there are no IDs. The comment indicates that the service might be needed for card ID related operations, implying that the removal of the isEmpty() check is intentional.

```java
    synchronized (options.cardSetIds) {
      try {
        final List<CardSet> cardSets = new ArrayList<>();

        // Not injecting the service itself because we might need to assisted inject it later
        // with card id stuff.

        if (!options.getPyxCardSetIds().isEmpty()) {
          @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") final List<CardSet> pyxCardSets = session
              .createQuery("from PyxCardSet where id in (:ids)")
              .setParameterList("ids", options.getPyxCardSetIds()).list();
          cardSets.addAll(pyxCardSets);
        }

```
