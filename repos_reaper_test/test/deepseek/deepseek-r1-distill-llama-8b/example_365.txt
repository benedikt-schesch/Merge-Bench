To resolve the semantic merge conflict, I need to analyze the intent behind both sides of the merge.

The `buildGetRequest` method returns a new `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` without any parameters. This suggests it's creating a request object for GET requests. The `buildHeadRequest` method initially checks if the class supports HEAD requests. However, the intent might be to also create a request object for HEAD requests with the provided URL.

The correct resolution is to ensure both methods consistently create request objects with the provided URL by passing it as a parameter to the constructor, while maintaining the conditional logic for HEAD requests.

```java
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildGetRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildHeadRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    if (!supportsHead()) {
