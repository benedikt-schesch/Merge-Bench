To resolve the merge conflict, the variable `session` was declared without a data type in one version and with `Session` in another. The correct declaration must include the data type to satisfy Java syntax.

```java
 *
 */
public class SSHSocketImplFactory implements SocketImplFactory, Logger {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLogger(SSHSocketImplFactory.class);

    private static Session session;

    public static SSHSocketImplFactory getFactory() throws JSchException, IOException {
        return getFactory(System.getProperty("ssh.gateway"));
