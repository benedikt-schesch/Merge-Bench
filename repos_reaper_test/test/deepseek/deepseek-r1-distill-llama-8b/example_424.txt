To resolve the import conflict, we need to determine which import is necessary based on the code's usage. Since the second commit removed `DocumentTypes`, it's likely not needed, so we keep the imports from that commit. Thus, `DocumentModel` and `ModelAttributes` are imported, and `DocumentTypes` is removed.

```java
package org.jbake.app;

import org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;
import org.hamcrest.BaseMatcher;
import org.hamcrest.Description;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.jbake.model.ModelAttributes;
```
