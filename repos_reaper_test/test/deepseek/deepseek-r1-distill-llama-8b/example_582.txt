To resolve the merge conflict, I analyzed both code snippets and determined that the second version is more efficient and appropriate. It directly retrieves the "data" as a JsonObject and extracts the "url" directly, which is likely the correct structure after potential refactoring. Thus, the older version using a string parse is no longer necessary.

```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

<<<<<<< HEAD
    JsonObject picData = rawPicture.get("data").asObject();
    if (picData != null) {
      picture = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(picData.toString(), ProfilePictureSource.class);
    }
  }
=======
    JsonObject picData = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data");
    if (picData != null) {
      picture = picData.getString("url");
    }
  }
