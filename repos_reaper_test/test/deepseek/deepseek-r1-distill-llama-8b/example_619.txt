The provided code snippet shows a conflict between two versions. The left side has a class comment followed by the `serialVersionUID` declaration, while the right side includes an additional Javadoc comment.

```java
   *
   * Represents the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/post#fields">Feed Targeting API type</a>.
   */
  public static class FeedTargeting extends Targeting {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    /**
     * Maximum age.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
>>>>>>> 1f2409cface39bbeb808c4067a722cf5a8a5ab97
```

The lines in question are conflicting because they differ in content. The left side does not have the `@Getter` and `@Setter` annotations, while the right side adds them after the `serialVersionUID` declaration, but the `@Getter` and `@Setter` annotations should be placed above the field declaration. This discrepancy is causing a merge conflict.

To resolve the conflict, the `@Getter` and `@Setter` annotations should be moved above the `serialVersionUID` line or the `serialVersionUID` should be placed after the annotations. The Javadoc comment is also misplaced; it should be placed directly before the field it's documenting.
