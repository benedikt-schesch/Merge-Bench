The provided code exhibits a merge conflict in a Java class. The conflict arises when different commits modify different parts of the same file, but Git detects a conflict due to overlapping changes. Here, the left side shows the original, the right side shows the modified, and the merged result includes both, preserving the necessary static import and the updated constants.

```java
import static org.junit.Assert;

public class ExitHookTest {

    private static final int KEY = 1;
    private static final int JVM_STARTUP_WAIT_TIME_MS = 2_000;
    private static final String PRE_SHUTDOWN_ACTION_EXECUTED = "PRE_SHUTDOWN_ACTION_EXECUTED";
    private static final String USER_SHUTDOWN_HOOK_EXECUTED = "USER_SHUTDOWN_HOOK_EXECUTED";

    @Rule
    public TemporaryFolder folder = new TemporaryFolder();
}
