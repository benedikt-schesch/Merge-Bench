The code appears to involve a merge conflict in the import statements. On the left side, `GestureOverlayView` is imported, but on the right side, it's removed.

Since `Context` is more widely used in Android development, it's likely More information should be provided to determine the appropriate way to merge these. Therefore, the conflict should be preserved until further context is available.
