The provided code has a conflict between two versions:
1. The `compareTo` method in the first snippet, which compares two `JobStats` objects.
2. A new `setBackendException` method added in the second snippet.

Since both methods are distinct, with one being a comparison method and the other an exception handling method, they do not conflict in functionality and can coexist. Therefore, both versions should be preserved to maintain their intended purposes. The correct resolution is to keep both methods without altering either.
