The code shows a merge conflict where one side declares `contentType` without initialization and the other initializes it to `null`. Since `contentType` is a string, not a primitive, initializing to `null` is idiomatic for a nullable value, ensuring it won't cause a null pointer exception. This seems intentional, so the right side (with `= null`) should be chosen to maintain this behavior.

```java
  private byte[] data;

  private InputStream dataStream;

  private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

  /**
```
