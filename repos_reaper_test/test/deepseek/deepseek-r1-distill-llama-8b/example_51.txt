The left side declares the copy without adding the elements, which is incomplete. The right side adds all players, properly initializing and copying. The right side's approach correctly creates a deep copy, so it should be merged.

```java
    }
    return info;
  }

  public final List<Player> getPlayers() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    final List<Player> copy = new ArrayList<Player>(players.size());
=======
    final List<Player> copy = new ArrayList<>(players.size());
    copy.addAll(players);
    return copy;
  }

    final List<Player> copy = new ArrayList<>(players.size());
    copy.addAll(players);
    return copy;
