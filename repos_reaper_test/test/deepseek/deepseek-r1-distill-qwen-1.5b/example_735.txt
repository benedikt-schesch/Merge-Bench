# Note

The provided code contains semantic inconsistencies in the way it handles negative values due to the use of modulo arithmetic. Specifically:

1. The Part `orientation` is used but then wrapped with `[ ( * ) + 360 ] % 360` which can cause negative values更低 than -180 degrees.

2. The `rotation` variable is calculated separately and then in cases of `else` we have a bug in the expression. Before the fix, it caused inconsistent results in some scenarios.

The live version of `[ ( * ) + 360 ] % 360` handles `[更低 than -180 and higher than 180 degrees]` more consistently, but in cases of `else` we need to use `rotation = (info.orientation + orientation + 180) % 360 * -1` to turn it into between `+180` and `-180` or maintain consistent direction. Plus, adding the `+_180` is redundant..., but perhaps better to explicitly negate the entire expression.

```java
orientation = ( ( (orientation * 2 - 360) * noise + 180 ) % 360 ) + 180;
orientation = ( ( (orientation * 2 - 360) * noise + 180 ) % 360 ) - 180;
```

Wait, the live version of the equation is correct, because:

( ( (orientation * 2 - 360) * noise + 180 ) % 360 ) = 60 if orientation is -720

Then, trying to add and subtract 180:

Yes, the live version of `rotation = (orientation * 2 - 360) * noise + 180 % 360`
Which produces a noise range for in low -360 to 180, but adds and subtracts 180, so ends up as:
180 to 360 if before adding 180 in the correct step. Wait, it's more complicated.

Regardless, I believe the user's intention was to model the bounds as -180 ≤ rotation ≤ 180, so maybe the live version of `rotation = (orientation * 2 - 360) * noise + 180 % 360`
Which produces a noise range for in low -360 to 180, but adds and subtracts 180, so ends up as:
180 to 360 if before adding 180 in the correct step. Wait, that may be causing inconsistent results.

Therefore, I would maintain my original code but under a suggestion to modify it for correct bounds.

Therefore, I suggest:

Make a version without the if/else, and correct the modulo operations.

```java
int rotation = ( (info.orientation - orientation + 180 ) * noise % 360 + 180 );
```

But perhaps it's better to use a consistent noise range.

Alternatively, as the user's intention was to model the bounds as -180 ≤ rotation ≤ 180, the correct expression is:

rotation = (orientation * 2 - 360) * noise + 180 % 360;

Which produces a range from 180 - 360 * noise to 180 + 360 * noise.

To get the noise within -1 to 1, the expression could be:

// noise param in 1-5
rotation = ( (orientation * 2 - 360) * noise + 180 ) % 360;

And finally offset into -180 to 180:

rotation = (rotation + 180) % 360 - 180;
```

So overall, the final code is as originally proposed but advised for correct handling of the limits.
