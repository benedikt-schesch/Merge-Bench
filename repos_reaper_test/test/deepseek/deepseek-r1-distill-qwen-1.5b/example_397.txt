To resolve the conflict and overlap between styles (text color and background color) in the test, Lambda constraints are added to retain the styles and synchronously handle datasets for the given test.

Now, the code will have the following patches:

```java
@Override
 assisted constraint List<Set}<增长率 Password>
```

```java
 pourrait constraint ListYL,
```

These constraints allow the application to set the text color to a specific value during the test, and when using a set patch to the statusBar, the styles not explicitly set before are applied, to override previous styles and the patches added in the test.
