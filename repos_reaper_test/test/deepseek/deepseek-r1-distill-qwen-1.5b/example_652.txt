```java
/**
 * @Getter
 */
 @Getter
 @Setter
 private String order;

/**
 * @Getter
 @Facebook("comment_order")
 @Setter
 private Boolean openGraphCommentOrder;

 @Facebook("can_comment")
 @Getter
 private Boolean openGraphCanComment;

 @Facebook("comment_order")
 @Submit("openGraphCommentOrder")
 @Submit(coconutParticlePr openGraphCanComment)

 FBCommentOrder.* =
 boost::FBCommentOrder.xx() as FBCommentOrder.xx;
```

Resolution of the conflict:
- The '@Facebook("can_comment")' syntax is causing a merge conflict with existing extension named FB can_comment
- By using '@Facebook("comment_order")' instead, both getters share the same property and the confusion is resolved

Migrate:
- Add the new @Getter FB("comment_order")
- Update the FBCommentOrder extension to use comment_order instead of can_comment only from this project area

Full migration with merged extensions:
```java
@Social
BFFption["fb月经"]["comment_order"] =
 FBCommentOrder.xx() as FBCommentOrder.xx;

@FB("comment_order")
@Submit("openGraphCommentOrder")
@Submit(coconutParticlePr openGraphCanComment)

FBCommentOrder.* =
 boost::FBCommentOrder.xx() as FBCommentOrder.xx;
```
