Here is the updated code snippet:

```java
 *          for more details.
 * @param <A> the type of the "actual" value.
 *
 * @author Nicolas François
 *
 * @return an instanceof of Basically Something-like
 * @param <A> the type of the "actual" value.
 *
 @returns a Verified, Essentially Something-like. This is for the Bits case.
 * @param <A> the type of the "actual" value.
 @param <A> the type of the "actual" value.

 @ wordpress:标志是否合规
 * @note The actual value should be of a type that can be seen by WordPress.
 * @throwsJVigiException if the actual value isn't suitable for verification.
 * @throws_SO_XException if the value can't be seen by the system.

public class BasicallySomethingLike<S extends BasicallySomethingLike<S, A>, A> implements AbstractAssert<S, A> {

  @VisibleForTesting
  Objects objects = Objects.instance();

  ← Also includes the Bit implementation
}
```

Change: Removed themland assignment because the BitsLike implementation is missing Bits semantics matching, so removing the code of BitsLike.

However, note that in the above snippet, the class was removed from the merge conflict because it isn't providing anything new and just the BitsLike LCS.
