To address the merge conflict, I'll ensure that both methods are properly connected.

The createSocketImpl method needs to log every socket it creates. Here's the fixed code:

```java
    public SocketImpl createSocketImpl() {
        return new SSHSocketImpl(session);
    }

    public void log(int arg0, String arg1) {
        log.error(arg0 + ": " + arg1);
    }
```

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identify the Issue**: The SSHSocketImpl instance isn't logging anything, and the provided code snippet shows an unproven log method overriding it without any associated logging.

2. **Determine the Missing Component**: The missing log method in the createSocketImpl suggests the need to add logging to the SSHSocketImpl during creation to capture its state.

3. **Implement the Missing Log Method**: Add a private `log` method to the SSHSocketImpl that accepts arguments and log using `log.error()`, thereby sharing the logging functionality.

**Fixed Code:**

```java
public SocketImpl createSocketImpl() {
    return new SSHSocketImpl(session);
}

public void log(int arg0, String arg1) {
    log.error(arg0 + ": " + arg1);
}
```
