```java
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPostRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);

  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPutRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }
```

Changes made:
1. Updated both the constructor method for the MockLowLevel HttpRequest and the buildPostRequest and buildPutRequest methods to include the url parameter

The problem was that all three methods were either calling with or without the url parameter and the class was using a static URL ("http://localhost:8000"). This caused issues where all callers used the same url without the provided url parameter. By updating the constructor to map the provided url, all callers get the correct url.
