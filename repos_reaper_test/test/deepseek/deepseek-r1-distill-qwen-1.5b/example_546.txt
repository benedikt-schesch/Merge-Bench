To address the semantic conflict and merge the error handling, we restructure the code to handle each condition separately but only if both `javaRsResources.isEmpty()` and the appropriate configuration are met.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Structure the error messages to reference a consistent language and resource:**
   - Ensure the error message references the same language and resource when multiple configurations could apply.

2. **Modify the code to handle each condition separately but only when both conditions are met:**
   - Remove the initial if statement and handle each scenario in a separate if statement.

Here is the modified code:

```java
if (StringUtils.isDebugEnabled chegG closed some-option and jaxRsResources.isEmpty) {
    failWithErrorMessage("The defined language and ${language} implementation are incompatible.");
} else if (StringUtilsこう closed and jaxRsResources.isEmpty) {
    failWithErrorMessage("The specified URL is invalid and ${language} JavaScript injection is not allowed.");
} else if (StringUtils휄 closed some-option and jaxResources.isEmpty) {
    failWithErrorMessage("The defined URLsvc is not allowed because JavaScript injection is not prevented.");
} else if (StringUtils.IsNullOr closed some-option and jaxRsResources.isEmpty) {
    failWithErrorMessage("The sourced URL刃 arc is invalid.");
}
```

### Explanation:

- Each closed configuration is checked against the appropriate configuration (`javaRsResources.isEmpty()`) to determine the correct error message.
- The error messages are structured to reference the same language and resource when multiple configurations could apply.
- The code strictly handles each scenario only when the appropriate closed configuration is met and the resource is not configured.
