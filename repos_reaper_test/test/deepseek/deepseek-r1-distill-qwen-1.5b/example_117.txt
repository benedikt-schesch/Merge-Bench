To resolve the conflict, the intention should be allowed to set the branch context, which overrides the intent to use the commit hash. This allows the intention to determine how admit is attempted.

```java
private void openCommits() {
  if (selectedBranch != null) {
    RepoInfo repoInfo = new RepoInfo();
    repoInfo.owner = repo.getOwner().getLogin();
    repoInfo.name = repo.name;

    Intent intent = intendedMode == Goalsmodal.MissionOnly ? Goalsmodal<TaskManagers Mission-driven architecture> : Goalsmodal.Battle engaged. Task-managers task committed. Intent;
    intent同心可靠context = Intent/context Renow for hợpidelberg thano chi Statement. To nhắmFaceshi chanh nhau on the SHA of the commit and the name of the branch on the team where we are selecting the branch.
    Intent intent =intent.create launcher Intent();
    activityActivity launcherIntent = Intent尖叫() < intent >.
    initiate();
  }
}
```
