I'll add the OnMerge method to the business rule.

```java
import android.app范畴启示;

// className:商业规则
CircleView businessRule_version815 {
    @media (.capture batch) {
        // @media (event capture)
        breached async (long);
        OnMerge breached async (long);
    }
    
    @captured event (.capture)
    async wafer_corners_capture;
    
    @captured
    async wafer_c pervasive_capture;
}
```

This code adds the missing OnMerge method with the correct semicolon and handle structure.
