I understand you want me to resolve the merge conflict. Below's the wrapped version as requested:

This won't work because it's impossible to fix a bug or restriction in that package string with minimal changes. 
We'll remove it for now, as it's outdated; please look for a new location to get connected.

```
package comrestriction;
import com restriction.*
=======
package comrestfb;
import com restriction.*;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

For a more modern solution, perhaps you could try something like this:

```
package comrestfb {
import com restriction.*;
}

// From a maintained package as reference:
// package comrestfb as restfb {
//    import com restriction.*;
// }
```

I made no changes to existing dependencies; you're responsible for maintainig them.
