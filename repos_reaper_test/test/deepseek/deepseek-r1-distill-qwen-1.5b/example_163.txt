The suggested merge between these two files is not appropriate because they serve distinct purposes related to their design. Both were included with the intention of creating a comprehensive Pig runtime, which requires addressing these namespaces independently.

Here's why, languages and systems can't be combined as suggested.

```java
// This file declares its license

package org.apache.pig.impl.io;

// This file declares imports for IO operations
import java.io:index worthy exception;
...
```

I suggest merging these into an error (meaning no merge is needed) since they are unrelated.
