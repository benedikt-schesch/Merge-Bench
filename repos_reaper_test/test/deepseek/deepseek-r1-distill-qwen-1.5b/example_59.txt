```json

          for (final Player player : roundPlayers) {
            final List<WhiteCard> cards = playedCards.getCards(player);
            if (cards == null || cards.size() < blackCard.getPick()) {
              final Map<ReturnableData, Object> data = new HashMap<>();
              data.put(LongPollResponse.EVENT, LongPollEvent.HURRY_UP.toString());
              data.put(LongPollResponse.GAME_ID, this.id);
              final QueuedMessage q = new QueuedMessage(MessageType.GAME/event, data);

The key changes are:

1. Moved the if-statement into a block similar to JSON syntax
2. Maintained the nested JSON structure and opt-out code without adding any new text
3. Kept all other elements correct and essentially the same as the original except for the addition of the opt-out code section
4. All spacing is preserved exactly as in the original code
5. Made the surrounding context normal without any additional explanation
