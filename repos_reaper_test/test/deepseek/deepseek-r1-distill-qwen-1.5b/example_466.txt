```java
// Returns a combined metric result with pagination information
        return new AggregateResult(context).withSuffix(suffix);
    }

    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public MetricResult measureUser(TestUser user, int targetLength, ResultList recommendations, Context context) {
        LongSet good = goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, user);

        if (good.isEmpty()) {
            logger.warn("no good items for user {}", user.getUserId());
        }

        Integer rank = null;
```

**Reasoning and Solution:**

1. **Full Context:**
   - The first snippet adds a suffix and previews the metric result.
   - The second snippet is a static method overriding a metric that selects good items for pagination.

2. **Potential Conflicts:**
   - The first snippet is async while the second is synchronous.
   - It seems unrelated, so merging them into one method may not fit the retention date or metadata flow.

3. **Effectiveness of Retention Date:**
   - Retention slides ensure data silos align, preserving time-stamped data and consistency.

**Conclusion:**

The two snippets likely shouldn't merge. They serve different purposes and flow into opposite flows. Retention slides are not applicable here, so it's safer to retain both while appropriate date handling.
