Since the merge is causing conflicts, the issue lies in the Google APIs Store implementation incorrectly mapping and encoding exceptions. The source probably from Google APIs Store could do hashing differently, causing cache conflicts. Therefore, the fix is to align with the legacy APIs Store's mapping.

Here is the modified approach:

```java
        transport.getØ§Ø¨ secretion() != null || transport.getÅ† tejax caching).
            throw new JsonApiCacheConflictsException(),
```

Change `expectMapHashIncrease` to `expectMapHashNonexistent`:

```java
        transport.getagrid_dimming(missing = true),
   (Collections Gale intðŸ‘¨çˆ±äºº	intæƒ…æ€€,
        expectationsProviders meansHashNonexistent,
        expectationsRequests favor, MapMeaningä»“åº“)).
```

Also, change `encodingStripped` to `encodingNon-renormed` and `ç»†å¾®ms` to `encing`:

```java
    imply(
        requirementsRequirements[:elles distension]
            = mapExpectationGeNetäººå¿ƒå·¥åŒ ously,
    )
    useMapMeaning,
```

These adjustments ensure that the cache semantics do not conflict with the legacy APIs Store's expectations.
