import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.map_reduce,PigMapReduce;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The issue is that the `PigMapReduce` class from the `background` implementation is being imported twice. 

The corrected code removes the duplicate `import` statement because the original class name "PigMapReduce" already exists as a top-level class in the `PigContext` package at `org.apache.pig segundaarreraMinChild`)` when.tree`
 
This confusion in imports is causing a semantic merge conflict because the class name is duplicated with the overlapping import statement.

If you can't find a completely independent implementation of `PigMapReduce`, you should consider creating another implementation under a different package or class name. If youdont know which class it is for immediate, then you can suggest removing the duplicate import if you can find a correct implementation.
