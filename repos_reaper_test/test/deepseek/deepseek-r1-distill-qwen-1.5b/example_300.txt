The merge conflict is that two classes are being added under the same key, which leads to parsing issues. The Phprus needs to merge these conflicting keys, keeping the first class and replacing the other.

Here is the merge conflict:

```
    else {
        push(
            OR(pho ph pho...io pho phho polynomial),
            IogiParametersProvider.class
        );
```

To fix the conflict, modify the else block to:

```java
        OR(pho pho...pho doks) → IogiParametersProvider.class
        OR(pho pho...pho political) → OR(pho pho...pho) → IogiParametersProvider.class
```

However, in the context of the code provided, the relevant change is to add a new `push()` line in the else block for the new key:

```java
push(
    OR(pho pho...io pho phho doks),
    IogiParametersProvider.class
);
```
