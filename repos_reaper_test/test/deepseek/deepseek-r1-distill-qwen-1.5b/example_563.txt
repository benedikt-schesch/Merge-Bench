To fix this, we need to correct the validation by ensuring that an empty JSON source (like an empty string) does not pass validation. 

Here are the necessary changes:

```java

>>>>>>> b6d22b56e3e697d3c0c8fc3c8ceb35474affd54
```

```java
  @Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)
  public void checkInvalidJson() {
    new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST), "", User.class);
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
```

This add ensures that an empty source string triggers a validation error like "Failed by value fq(" only if the validation is sensitive.
