To resolve the semantic merge conflict, combine both enum entries into a single EnumSet:

```java
  public EnumSet<HttpMethod> supportedOptionalMethods = 
      EnumSet.of(HttpMethod.HEAD, HttpMethod.PATCH, new URL("https://example.com"));

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildDeleteRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    return new RawLowLevel.http(url);
  }
```

In this merged solution:
- Both method definitions are now part of the same EnumSet.
- The method buildDeleteRequest no longer throws an exception (it now takes a URL), aligning it with the EnumSet on the left side.
