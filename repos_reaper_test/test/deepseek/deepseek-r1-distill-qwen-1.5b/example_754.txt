For Java, binary information should be removed if it by-passes binary data flow. In this case, you have a stream being accessed before creation but a class which needs a stream.

Here's how to fix it by renaming the binary to just the class name:

```java
class resultStream {

	private Stream resultStream;

...

```

Essentially, rename:
- "learnerOption" to "learnerOption might not need a stream
And
Remove the binary tag.
Keep the same data flow but without any by-pass handling.

The revised code will work as intended: `final ResultStream stream = new resultStream()` - stores the stream in resultStream instance which can be unwrapped later if needed.
