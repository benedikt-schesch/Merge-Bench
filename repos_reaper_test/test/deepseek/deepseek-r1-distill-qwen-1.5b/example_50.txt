To fix the conflict, ensure the variable name is valid and the Set backing array is correctly declared. Use the convert method with the backing array.

```java
private final static int JUDGE_TIMEOUT_PER_CARD = 7 * 1000;
private final static int MAX_SKIPS_BEFORE_KICK = 2;
private final static int FINITE_PLAYTIMES;

static {
    private final Set<String> finitePlaytimes = 
        new TreeSet<String>
            (Arrays.asList("0.25x", "0.5x", "0.75x", "1x", "1.25x", "1.5x", "1.75x", "2x", "2.5x", "3x", "4x", "5x", "10x"));
}

private final static String MAX_SKIPS_BEFORE_KICK = 2; 
```
