Let me analyze the provided code snippet and determine the optimal solution to merge them, considering their meaning and intent.

The first part is a comment in a preformatted code, likely part of JML logging. The second part declares a static factory class. These can't be merged as one is a comment and the other is a class declaration.

Here's my step-by-step explanation:

1. They are two unrelated parts.

2. Mapping them would lose crucial information.

3. Therefore, it's best not to merge them.

4. The correct approach is to leave both as is, noting the conflict.

I will provide the code as-is, including a note indicating the problematic merge.
