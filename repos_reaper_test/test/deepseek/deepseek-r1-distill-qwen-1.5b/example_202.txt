Java imports cannot have duplicate packages. Modify the duplicate imports to merge them:

```java
import java.util.Properties both scopes;

```
Or:
```java
import java.util.Properties . both versions;

```

But considering clarity in messages, update to:
```java
import java.util.Properties both perspectives;
```
