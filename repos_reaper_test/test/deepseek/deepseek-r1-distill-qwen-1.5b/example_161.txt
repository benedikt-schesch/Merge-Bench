I've converted the opening comment to match the Javadoc style but I also originally recreated an optional survey article note as an older version. Essentially, this maintains the original body and repetitions of 'AS IS' but changes the comment style to match Javadoc/ISO DRAFT SINGULAR where appropriate. The key decisions here are:

1. Switched comment style from `* ... */` style to `{ START ... }` style due to the need to mirror the JSON/Java/
2. Removed `{ ... convergence * ... }` from original comments
3. The comment remains discussing dependencies but structures to serve as optional survey article notes
4._helper``` surrounding the comment lines
5. Adjusted spacing for proper formatting

- License version 1.1
- Doesn't require any additional changes to existing code except for displaying it in this format
