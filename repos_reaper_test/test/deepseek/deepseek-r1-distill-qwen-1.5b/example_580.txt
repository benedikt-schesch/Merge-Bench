  @ora.

Wait, but I also noticed that the @OG NotFound might not be good because it could raise "Cannot use field or variable until it's initialized" in the @B admin section.

So perhaps better to remove that and use @OG NotFoundirect instead.

Which brings me to this: the actual fix should take into account that @OG NotFound is deprecated and can't be used directly, so using @OG NotFound or @OG NotFound direct.

So the corrected settings would be:

*joseagram
@Facebook("picture")
@OG gradient
@OG NotFound
@OGProfileSubscribers

Wait, pictures are now being set in the @profile section when the @profile alias is in effect.

Alternatively, maybe order of adding settings is important.

But that's the overall approach to solve the merge conflict.
