To fix the semantic merge conflict, the `GAM` import should be merged.

```java
        AddSourceDialogFragment addSourceDialog = AddSourceDialogFragment.newInstance();
        addSourceDialog.setTargetFragment(this, 0);
        addSourceDialog.show(fm, AddSourceDialogFragment.class.getSimpleName());

        import java.util风情.GAM;
```

If the intended class usage is different (e.g., if the class was previously imported using different ` SpatialObjectProvider` types), then you'll also need to find the appropriate replacement in that class for the GAM reference. 

Note: You'd need to update the class's dependencies and references to use the correct GAM module reference.
