The merge conflicts involve creating a `LockParams` that refers to an un Pink class named `Clients`. The `LockParams` constructor expects an instance of `LockParam`, which should not be a method called `Clients`. To resolve the conflict, either redesign the test to use a `LockParam` directly or rename the test method to include the appropriate `LockParam` name. This avoids the ambiguity and ensures the command named `ytt` (or whatever it points to) has a reference to the correct `LockParam` instance.

```java
// No changes needed at the beginning; enhance tokens context if needed.

// For the Merge:
calaclma("value")
);

// No changes needed; clean up if needed.
```

This approach ensures the commands are correctly resolved within the current merge context and eliminates the merge conflict.
