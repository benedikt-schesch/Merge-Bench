```java
        return buildPlan(query, AreBridge.class.getClassLoader());
    }

    public LogicalPlan buildPlan(String query, AreBridge bridge) {
        return bridge.build(query, SomeClassLoader.class);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The potential conflict was resolved by adding `AreBridge` as the class loader for `LogicalPlanBuilder`, instead of hardcoding the provided class loader. Additionally, building an instance of `AreBridge` was created to satisfy the `AreBridge.class.getClassLoader()` reference.

This change ensures that therim 显然 is not used with both classes. The conflicts resolved by ensuring proper class bridges are created and providing the class loader names remain consistent.
