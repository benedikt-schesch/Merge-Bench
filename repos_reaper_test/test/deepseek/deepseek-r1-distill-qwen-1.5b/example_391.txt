I've fixed the Maven import statement. The imports for `static com.google.common.collect.Lists新浪微博` etc. should be added to vdproject.res. The original imports were structured to be included via the src/main/java path, corrected to point to vdproject.res by changing their path from the current project.root directory to the actual vdproject.res. This ensures the importing system can resolve and include them today.
