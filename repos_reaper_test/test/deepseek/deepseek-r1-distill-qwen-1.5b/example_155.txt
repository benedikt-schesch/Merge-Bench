Here is the rewritten code snippet preserving the structure:

```java
+a = filter b by tail >5;

describe a;
+b = filter a by tail >5;

 destructure b into 'tmp.Resize-Test-Multi-Query-Local1';
 destructure b into 'size:posfix';
 
 store b into '[\']orrect-pig-release-[\'$tmp_DIR Latinos-Test-Pig-Local1$';
```
