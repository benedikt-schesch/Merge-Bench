Let me break down the merge conflict step by step:

1. Issue: The `@param` annotation in the project is missing. Currently, the CVS shows it's missing. The project must have added the `@param` incorrectly or have conflicting `@param` annotations.

2. Impact: Depending on the rest of the ctv commit history, the impact could vary. If the issue hasn't been properly resolved within the project, it could cause errors in dependent record views or other issues.

3. Proposition: The best approach is to ignore the missing `@param` annotation since it's in conflict, and provide a note that it was missing.

4. Recommendation: Highlight the importance of the missing `@param` and let the developers know it's a required change.

Conflict Fixes:

1. Required: @param <List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>>

2. Optionally: Replace @return with:
`@return List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>`
