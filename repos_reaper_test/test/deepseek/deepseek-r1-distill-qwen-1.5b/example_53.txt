To resolve the merge conflict in the provided code:

```markdown
          if (!roundPlayers.contains(player)) {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
          }
          final List<WhiteCard> playerCards = playedCards.getCards(player);
          if (playerCards != null && blackCard != null && playerCards.size() == blackCard.getPick()) {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
          } else {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.PLAYING;
          }
        ```

This matches the left side by restructuring the code to avoid conflicts while preserving all spacings.
