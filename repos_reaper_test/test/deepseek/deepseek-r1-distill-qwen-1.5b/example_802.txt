Original code:
```java
    MultiAction batch;
    boolean schedule_flush = false;

    synchronized (this) {
      if (batched_rpcs == null) {
        batched_rpcs = new MultiAction(server_version);
=======
    MultiAction batch;
    boolean schedule_flush = false;

    synchronized (this) {
      if (batched_rpcs == null) {
        batched_rpcs = new MultiAction();
        addMultiActionCallbacks(batched_rpcs);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change makes the code singular across the synchronized block, fixing the possible confusion between developside and releaseside implementations.
