  public String toString() {
        return "Video Status: \"ready\", \"processing\" | \"error\"\n";

```

If you'd like to add an enum version instead, you can implement a Status enum:

```java
public enum Status {
    Ready(0);
    Processing(1);
    Error(2);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The conflict is resolved by implementing the toString() method consistent with the abstract class template and the publicly defined Status enum of the abstract base class FacebookType, providing a clear string representation of the class's state.
