```

The decision follows these considerations:

1. "Cluster" is a potential ambiguous term in object-oriented context
2. Clusters are typically referred to as "class" in MapReduce workflow
3. rename "cluster" to "class" in the method parameter name to improve clarity
4. Rename parameter name from "class_ to "class
5. Keep other issues the same
6. The change doesn't affect runtime visibility which is consistent with MapReduce
7. This change only affects the parameter scope that were ambiguous before

The resulting code is clearer and maintains type consistency regarding the parameter scopes, while also reserving the remaining meaning of "cluster" for MapReduce context if needed today.
