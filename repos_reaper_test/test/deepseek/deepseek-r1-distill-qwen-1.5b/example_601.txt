Here is the fixed code:

```java
     * May throw a JsonException
     * 
     * @return
     */
    public JsonObject getValueAsJsonObject() {
      return Json.valueOf(value);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The method was previously returning a JsonElement from parsing, which caused a JsonException. The updated method now correctly convert the value to a JsonObject without exception.
