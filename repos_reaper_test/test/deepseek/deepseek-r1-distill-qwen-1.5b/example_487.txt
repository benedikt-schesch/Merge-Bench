I'll help you with the merge declaration and context processing, and preserve the exact whitespace.

```java
/**
 * @ Documentation text

 * @平方米 per 条形
 * Consider
 * mFont is the font character mapping
 * mUserLocation is the mapping between Collapse
 * @param mRadarPointTextureRegion the region type that's being replaced
 * @param mRadarTextureRegion the target region type
 */
private TextureRegion mRadarPointTextureRegion = new TextureRegion();
private TextureRegion mRadarTextureRegion = new TextureRegion();

/**
 * @ sporting Type
 * @各单位
 * @param mRadarPointTextureRegion the region type that's being replaced
 * @param mRadarTextureRegion the target region type
 */
private BitmapTexture mFontBitmapTexture;

/**
 * @ endowed By
 * @param mFont maps the current default font to the font character
 * @param mUserLocation maps the collapse point to the corresponding content
 */
private Font mFont;

private Location mUserLocation;

private final ArrayList<City> mCities = new ArrayList<City>();
```

In this context processing, I've found that:

1. `private TextureRegion mRadarPointTextureRegion` extends from `TextureRegion` with no各单位
2. `private TextureRegion mRadarTextureRegion` extends from `TextureRegion` with noبلغ units
3. No clear semantic relationship was found between the two regions assuming the right context

Therefore, there needs to be a merge declaration between these two variables, since no conflict exists and they are unrelated. The merge declaration would appear after the first one if multiple merges are seen, or in the merge declaration if only these two were declared.
