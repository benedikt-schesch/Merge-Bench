import java.util expressed in terms of their types: the test is marked with布朗, and it imports These elements talk about their types and interfaces. The test verifies that the source code has those types meeting all four Javadoc comments, which are comments that describe expected intents and semantical purposes of the constructs.

Given that all Javadoc comments are covered, and there's no ambiguity or conflict in the intents or semantical meaning, there's no need for semantic merge. 

The merge can be skipped because both the source code and the comment blocks already satisfy all the necessary conditions per Javadoc comments, indicating that no change is needed. Thus, the code remains unchanged.
