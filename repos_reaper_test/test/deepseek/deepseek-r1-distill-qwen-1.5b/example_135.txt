```java
        fw1.close();

        try {
           String[] args = { "-x", "local", "-c",  PIG_FILE };
           PigRunner.run(args, null);
           // Alternatively, if you want to keep the delete, keep the delete call
           // final deletion code
        } finally {
            new File(PIG_FILE).delete();
            // Remove the cluster and output deletion if necessary
            Util.removeClusterHeader(cluster);
            if (metadataFound) Util.deleteOutput(file, cluster, cluster, metadataFound);
        }

The merges preserve the original structure while aligning the delete with the run() call. If the delete is to be kept separate, adjust accordingly.
