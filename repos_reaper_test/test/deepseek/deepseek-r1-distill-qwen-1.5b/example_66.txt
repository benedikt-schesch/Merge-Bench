        the left side is declaring cardData, the right is assigning it to cardData.eachcase before decrementing. These are two separate issues, both at odds: the right has 'faceDownCards--, faceDownCards--

        it seems the right wants each player to have faceDownCards properly tracked, while the left's contract declarations are conflicting. So, the solution is to align both sides to use the same contract and ensure that before other code здоров(rgData) or similar.
