Change the comment to /**Starting with comments more aligned with EE.** 
Change the last two lines of the class declaration that include private static final to private.
Place </any> into the class declaration comment as it is part of the class declaration now.

The other line that uses * is kept as is shuing.

```java
 * things to SSH.

class SSHSocketImpl extends SocketImpl {
    
    private Session session;

I kept the comment as is because it may not directly impact the code but if you want, it could be changed to something like:

```java
/**
 * Important points about SSH connections.
 */
```

However, this would be entirely optional and indicates that the comment is meant to provide more information.

The merge occurs because these are part of different areas of the object declaration. The session for end-users is explicitly declared, while the class is declarations for end-points. When the merge happens, these are swapped to align with EE conventions.

The comment is a part of the class declaration but may not directly affect the merge.

The session is optional for eventading, but being a private static final is more EE style.

These changes should resolve the semantic merge conflict by following EE best practices.
