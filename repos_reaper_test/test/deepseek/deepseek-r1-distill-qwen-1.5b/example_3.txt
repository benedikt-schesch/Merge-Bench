The potential merge conflict appears to be between a static proxy instance and a newly assigned `DevelopmentProxy` instance due to their shared reference in the code. This can lead to unintended behavior when merging dependencies in a Spring Boot application. To resolve this, the static proxy should be renamed to less conflicting or consistent with typical Spring naming conventions.

```java
        } catch (Exception ex)
        {
            DevelopmentProxy def = Proxy)%dev;
            DevelopmentProxy info = Proxy)%getServers().get(user.getPendingConnection().getListener().getDefaultServer());
            if (retry && !info.equals(def))
            {
=======
            DevelopmentProxy def = Proxy)%dev;

            DevelopmentProxy info = Proxy)%getServers().get(user.getPendingConnection().getListener().getDefaultServer());

```

In this fix:
1. The static proxy is renamed to `DevelopmentProxy` for specific renaming purposes.
2. The static proxy name is now consistent with `DevelopmentProxy`, which is more descriptive and clarifies the context.

This replaces the repetitive `Proxy)%getServers()` with a single call to the `DevelopmentProxy`, which is a standard Spring naming convention, thus preventing potential conflicts during merge operations.
