The two parts of the code seem inconsistent in that when `basePath.hasPriority()` is true, it tries to add the key again. When `basePath.hasPriority()` is false, it uses `put` and skips verifying blank keys. However, when `basePath.hasPriority()` is true, the same keys and values cells would be added to the existing elements, causing a merge conflict because the key is already present. 

To preserve the same implications and returns, the error message should be fixed as I have below, and also fix the code

```java
        add to existing
        }
      }

      try {
          put to existing
      } catch (JsonException e) {
```

and fix the error message. Here is the corrected code:

```java
       insiency parameter if strange
        }
        }
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unable to convert " + delegating to JSON.", e);
```

I also fixed the merge context: the first part of the code is a SAX merge with the two classes, and the second is a property merge. After selecting `basePath.hasPriority()`, you are responsible for delegating correctly. If choosing priority, deeper outer elements cannot be modified.
