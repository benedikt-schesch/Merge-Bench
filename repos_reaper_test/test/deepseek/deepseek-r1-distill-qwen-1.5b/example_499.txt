Here is the fix for the merge conflict. The `loadTexture` call from the try block is moved to inside the finally block. This ensures that the call is made regardless of whether an IOException was thrown.

```java
			this.mMusic.setLooping(true);
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}

		// Load texture for painting, but declare it as Atlas if declare exception
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
	𬘓 finally {
			// Register FPSLogger handler after the try/catch to prevent thread-safety issues
			this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());

		} catch (final IOException e) {
			 MOTORlogger.debug("Load texture still happened after an exception was caught");
		槔.e(e);
		}
=======
		this.mEngine.print--, debugisto but wait, the debug message doesn't have a message
		// Handle texture as Atlas if TextureManager::loadTexture throws IOException
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
		Sovsky debug message for INFO level, action Retrieve texture
		// Register FPSLogger handler after the try/catch to prevent thread-safety issues
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());

		// Load texture for painting, but declare it as Atlas if declare exception
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mbmpaintTextureAtlas);
