I suggest renaming `MAXVASCSnapshot` to `MAXVASC` to match the existing variable name. Alternatively, the conflict could involve the constants if they are used. If considering merging constants:

 proposals could be to change `ALARM_GET` and `ALARM_REPORT` to a single constant:

```java
private static final int ALARM = 0x04;
private static final int ALARM tornado = 0x05;
```

or to change `ALARMvary` to `ALARM varies`. The solution depends on the context and desired outcome.
