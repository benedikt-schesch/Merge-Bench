```java
       Availability ra = m avatar being registered here starts off as being NOT playing.</p>
        @Override
        public void play() {
        mMediaPlayers:{ individual movies are retrieved

            if (mMedia Players is null or already playing:{ the media player is started once more

                            mMedia Players is created from the MediaPlayer record or set defaults to avoid failing during initialization

    }

    @Override
    public void pause() {
      avatar being paused here avoids confusing play state semantics going back to play() will correctly restart if needed

    }
```

### Resolved:{ However, AMD event where the default register starts the media if it's paused.

### Analysis:
The problem arose from failing play() in preview rendering when pause() sets a paused state. The freeze event avatar being registered here starts off as being NOT playing.</p><br>```java
            sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
      if (sMediaPlayer != null && !sMediaPlayers.isPlaying()):
          sMediaPlayer.start();
```

### Issues:
This caused mPlayState of play() misbehaving when in paused state.

### Explanation:
- The free surface event set to paused is used specially.
- Placeholder region: Initial sMediaPlayers.query mPlayState may cause issues.
- Best practice: This should start fallback when mPreparedQuery is null or raypan.

### Best Practice:
Apply broadcaster.MULTIPOSE to its initial value to fix the visibility issues.
