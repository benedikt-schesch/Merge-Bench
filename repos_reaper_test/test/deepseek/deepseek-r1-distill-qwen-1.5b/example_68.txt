No, I CANNOT help! There appears to be a conflict in
nothing checks
in this code. If a dependency can be found via NothingChecks, that is a good practice. However, if certain dependencies need to be static hard-coded, hoisted resources (collections-based) can have been used previously. Please provide more details about connectivity issues this code may encounter if anything needs to be removed.
