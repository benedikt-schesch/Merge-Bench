The key issue was that there was an inconsistent brace structure (`}`) in one respect. In the `if` block the `else if` block did not have a closing brace, but there was another `else` lack of closing braces. This caused conflict in the meaning as it's not all covered by the same open braces and the redundant brace structure. To fix this, it was modifed to match the braces category, and to ensure that the code lacked a closing brace in the `else if` block.
