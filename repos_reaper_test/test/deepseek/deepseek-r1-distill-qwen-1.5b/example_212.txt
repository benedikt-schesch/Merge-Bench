Below is the exact code in the requested style:

```java
// and we set retPos to newPos once we have read a character from that block.
// see getPos() for more detail
private long retPos, newPos = -1;

public CBZip2InputStream(SeekableInputStream zStream, int blockSize) throws IOException {
    retPos = oldPos = zStream.tell();
>>>>>>> 145f7b353e4f1f894994ceeb1c8d9d438619f75da
    FIXME        // we track the result of that read operation.
    // see getPos() for more detail
    private CBZip2InputStream(SeekableInputStream zStream, int blockSize) {
    }
```

So:

- The code uses `private retPos` and `private newPos` as before
- `retPos` and `newPos` are both set using requests from the input stream (using `tell()`)
- `retPos` is also updated with ` expense oldPos`, which is appropriate when-over fit rule applies. 

Here:
- Both lines set `retPos` when the constructor is called
- Both lines set `newPos` (but `newPos` is never reassigned, so it remains at -1)
- The first instance adds to the useful backward compatibility:

  - ExploitingUE when backing up
  - Leading injection and bypassing validation
  - Achieving early termination
  - Stabilizing requests in the default transport (but not Secure)
  - Supporting compression of JSON and SSH information

The second instance sets the previous position requested when-over fit rule applies. 

Here:
- Both functions set `retPos` when the constructor is called
- Both functions set `newPos` is never re-assigned to -1
- Lines 1 and 2 are completely interchangeable

Thus, the code does not suffer from any merge conflict as it is precisely when-over fit rule consistent.

The semantical goals are:
- In `_setPos()`: guide the seek to the next position (oldPos + 1)
- With `_singlePosition()`: only ret Mark the position and never update newPos (but maybe not a backward fit scenario useful case but maybe for older code)

So, when backing up data in `_setPos()` with `cost ` expense oldPos`, the `newPos` variable is only used in the default transport (but not Secure), and thus never used or updated.

Thus, the two matches are compatible.

Neither has an ambiguous intent. Thus, the proposal is:
 
Keep both lines as they are correctly setting the two desired positions variables. They do not merge. Thus, the code is fine.
