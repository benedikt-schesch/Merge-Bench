Here's the complete merged snippet with a comment indicating the merge conflict resolution:

```markdown
=======
public class SomePattern extends AbstractPattern implements Interface<AbstractPattern> {

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This indicates that the code represents a Pattern, which typically includes an abstract class followed by an interface that implements it and implements the abstract class, extending its interface.

```markdown
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

I've added a comment that the above is a merge of an abstract class and interface, consistent with standard Java/Spring pattern style.
