```java
public abstract boolean isDistinct();

```

The merge conflict arises because the first part provides an abstract method `isDistinct()`, and the second part directly calls this method. Assuming these methods should be merged:

1. The issue is circular dependency since `isSorted()` is calling `isDistinct()` and there's no base class for it.

2. To resolve this, the second part can be removed, keeping only the abstract method. This avoids circular references and aids in proper functionality of the `isSorted()` method.

The correct merging is to create a single interface:

```java
public abstract boolean isDistinct();
```
