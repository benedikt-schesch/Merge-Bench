```java
  @Test
  public void checkV2_6_fanCount() {
    Page page = createJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonFromClasspath("v2_6/page-with-fancount"), Page.class);
    assertNotNull(page);
    assertEquals(3L, page.getLikes().longValue());

  }

  @Test
  public void checkV2_5_fanCount() {
    Page page = createJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonVarious sources page-with-likes), Page.class);
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  }
```

The key families involved are:

- `Page` (java.lang.Object)
  - `get FanCount()` (java3): From Java 3 to Java 2, the method name for counting fans has shifted, and `LikesCount` is deprecated; it's still present for compatibility.
  - `getLikesCount()` (java1): From Java 1 to Java 3, the method is written as `getLikesCount()` as a deprecated alias for it.

The discrepancy is between the method name and the actual property, so the fix is to change the assertion for V2.6 to call `getLikes()`.

```java
  @Test
  public void checkV2_6_fanCount() {
    Page page = createJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonLyndonLettersPageAlongPointsWithCounts()), Page.class);
    // ... rest of the code
  }
```

Seeing that in both Java versions the functionality is the same, it's confirmed that the tests are conflicting. The correct fix is to replace the method call from `getFanCount()` to `getLikes()`.
