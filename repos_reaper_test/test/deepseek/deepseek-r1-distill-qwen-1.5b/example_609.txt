Alright, so let's break down how I arrived at the answer. The task is to merge a class with another that may have a conflicting method. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify the Problem**: The issue arises because there's a method named `type` in both the target class and the PageStartInfo class. The target class has `type` as `long`, while PageStartInfo declares `type` as `long` (in the existing code, the typo was fixed by changing the class tag from `@告诉 Facebook` to `()`, but the `type` property remains `long`).

2. **Flip the Typing**: Since the typo in class tag was resolved, but the `type` property is still `long`, we need to change it to `String` to resolve the conflict.

3. **Modify the Class**: Update the PageStartInfo class to use `String` for the `type` field.

The final code will reflect the fix for the `type` property.

```java
public static class PageStartInfo extends AbstractFacebookType {

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String type;

}
```
