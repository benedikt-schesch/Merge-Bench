To resolve the semantic conflict, the merge should proceed across the four fields suitable for the constructors.

```java
private String code = null;
private int options = 1;
private String mhtmlRoot = "";
private String outputFilename = "_empty";
private String htmlRoot = DEFAULT_MAX_URI_LENGTH;

```
