To fix the semantic merge conflict for the tiny code snippet:

```markdown
// TODO: Smells bad. A lot\\
Object o = new Object();

// TODO: At some point, reuse Oven\\
Oven oven = new Oven(createConfiguration());
=======
// TODO: Smells bad. A lot
Object o = new Object();

// TODO: At some point, reuse Oven
Oven oven = new Oven(createConfiguration());
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key semantic issue is the lack of proper spacing after the backslash. The original code had `// TODO: Smells bad. A lot` and then `Oven oven...`. 

On the second line, it was not properly spaced due to the absence of extra spaces after the \\\\. The fix adds the necessary spacing. This ensures proper HTML styling and removes the conflicting formatting.
