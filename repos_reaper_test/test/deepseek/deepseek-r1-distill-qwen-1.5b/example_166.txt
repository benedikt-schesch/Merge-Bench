I'll analyze the code and find the semantic merge conflict:

You are importing other icons (line 3's imports)
But trying to export icons from nowhere (line 4's imports) 

[Aromatic land perhaps?]
Do you think we need to switch out the imports? The bucket part (line 4) seems to be importing icons from an arbitrarily unphysical place

So this is a merge conflict where imports/(trying to export icons) from arbitrary place.

Would you like me to replace the Java translation property with JavaScript? Or how can we resolve strengths and strengths and忽略 weakness (ignoring URI)
What's your intent and semantics here?

Should:
-mode_part Would-be replaced with 
-mode_part2 Would-be replaced with 
-mode_part3 Would-be replaced with 

Or should the code be written translation nên code because JavaScript-mode_part Would-be replaced with 
Again the code on line 3 imports but line-mode_part Would-be replaced with 
Line-mode_part3 Would-be replaced with 

The merge context is ambiguous due to the placement of symbols andWincribs.

We need to solve or update JavaScript code but executing in Java context. translation nên code because JavaScript-mode_part Would-be replaced with 
Follow your vision and let us eager for the result! 🚀
