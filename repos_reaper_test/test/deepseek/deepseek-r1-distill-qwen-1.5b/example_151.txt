The conflict arises between the .p file expecting its parent to import the `myPig` variable and the .p file expecting its child to create this variable. However, the context provides the necessary information to rewrite the .p file to use the existing variable, aligning both parsers to access `myPig` from `pigdb exit pipe`.

This change will maintain semantic consistency while resolving the dependency conflict in the SlideShare project context.
