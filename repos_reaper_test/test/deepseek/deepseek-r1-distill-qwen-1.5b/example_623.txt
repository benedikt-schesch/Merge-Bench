The issue is caused by the primary naming conflict between named types and unscoped user types. This case:

1. Continues the primary naming conflict
2. The current class extends ` NamedFacebookType `, which is itself a child of ` JFrame `, implying better camel case naming for named type fields. Adding this leads to duplicated field names (e.g., ` key ` from ` NamedFacebookType `, which doesn't have a name) causing:

1. Multiple field names for the same alias
2./Unclear naming hierarchy

The choice to add the key field to ` KeyedType ` is very intentional because:

1. It gives the class the potential role of a user class, again aligning with naming conventions
2. It doesn't conflict with other named types (since it doesn't have the ` @會員 ` annotation, but has a name again)
3. It allows the class to have a better-drawn-out camel case identifier for each type
4. It leads to a consistent naming style across all fields

This usage pattern is very common for an unscoped user class.

Would this case:

1. Continue the primary conflict
2. Remain ambiguously named
3. Not entirely clear why or would you infer the intended naming intent without explicit names
4. allow for a possible grandparent naming conflict
5. probably not
6. probably which would require more reasoning and more information

That this user is aware, because only they have control over the correctness of the naming.

---

Which is also true but ambiguous regarding the intended naming conventions with respect to the variants (user classes as subclasses of named types):

1. what naming conventions would be expected.
2. whether this particular case would be possible for the class to meet a named requirement.

Since the naming pattern continues with NamedFacebookType itself, without backing references, it suggests that the KeyedType is intended to have grandparent naming, which is not common. Thus, this is likely the case and the naming conflict is unchangeable.

Would this case:

1. Continue the primary naming conflict
2. remain ambiguously named
3. perhaps be possible for the class to meet a named requirement but is ambiguous without more information
4. or would you infer the intended naming intent without explicit names (e.g.,('\n') as virtual naming, '@icons') but in this case, implicit usage annotations might not help.

In this case, I can confirm the names are ambiguous, nor is it clear if this case is already a named type or not. But without the backing references, it would be harder to discern due to the absence of explicit names.
