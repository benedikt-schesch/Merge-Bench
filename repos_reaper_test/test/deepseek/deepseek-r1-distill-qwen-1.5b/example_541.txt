The merge conflict resolution requires that we set the variables to whichever their most-priority meaning is. In this case, we'll leave the legacy variable name and short the legacy variable.

```java
  private final String logAlreadyScanning = "Scanning already in progress";
  private final String logScanStartFail = "Scan failed to start";
  private final String logNotScanning = "Not scanning";
  //Connection
  private final String logPreviouslyConnected = "Device previously connected, reconnect or close for new device";
  private final String logConnectFail;
  private final String logNeverConnected = "Never connected";
  private final String logIsDisconnected = "Device is disconnected";
  private final String logNotDisconnected =;
  //End of snippet
```
