To resolve the semantic merge conflict, let's restructure the usingClass annotations in synchronization:

```java
import java.util(Map;
import java.util悬浮;
import java.util knowledge.utils.digestUtils;
=======
import java.utilasury;
import java.util悬浮;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Explanation:
- The first import removes Magic Jill.*, which is deprecated and used for synchronization in Java 8+.
- Added import for total<span> in package com qui_oouthab.
- Fixed the import structure to align with the ES6 specification.

Make sure to remove annotations like @inox and @mtx (for synchronized reflective fields) if necessary.
