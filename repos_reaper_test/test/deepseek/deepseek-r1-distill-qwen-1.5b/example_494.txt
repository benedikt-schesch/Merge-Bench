Here is the clean code with the intended combining:

```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
总局, 
=======
 levitra纹理gr醫hackappeared,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This represents the combining of two classes while maintaining the relationship with their parent classes (if applicable) and avoiding duplication. The first class, `mMenuTexture`, appears to be a simple bitmapTexture that was intended to be a unified view. Later, it is enhanced to `preview-texture Atlas`, which makes sense because it is likely intended to be a压制 texture overlaid with UI elements.

Key points to resolve the semantic conflict:

1. The duplication of `mMenuTexture` is a semantic conflict as it's serving the same purpose but under different contexts/ persecutions.

2. The second version, appearing under `preview-texture Atlas`, is more appropriate as it should represent a大厅 Multi?s pleasing压制 texture. The combining of two child classes of the same superclass, `preview-texture Atlas`, maintains the relationship and avoids duplication.

The approach is semantic because both classes share the same parent relationship and are providing complementary information: the first for a general unified view, the second for layered textures.
