Here's the corrected code ensuring each part is correctly formatted and properly formatted:

```java
    }

    /**
     * Returns the length of a file in bytes which exists in the HDFS accounts for replication.
     * @param filename
    */

    /**
     * Returns the length of a file in bytes which exists in the HDFS accounts for replication.
     * @param filename
    */
    
    public long fileSize(String filename) throws IOException {
        DataStorage dfs = pigContext.getDfs();
        ElementDescriptor elem = dfs.asElement(filename);
```
