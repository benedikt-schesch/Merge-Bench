To resolve the semantic merge conflict, we need to prevent the container's aspect ratio from being updated if it has already been set by the super() method. This means the setter should only invert the ratio if it's currently set and only then ensure it's stored. 

**markdown:**
```json
C# (折扣 by :command setAspectRatio(double _ratio):)

- super(context, attrs);
- setAspectRatio(4.0f/3.0f);  // sets aspect ratio to 4/3.
- public void setAspectRatio(double ratio) { 
    // Check if aspect has been set
    if (mAspectRatio == ratio) {
        // Cap ratio to avoid imprecise floating points
        ratio = (int) (ratio / 100.0);
        mAspectRatio = (int) (ratio * 100.0);
    }
    // Invert ratio and notify the caller if needed
    ratio = 1f / ratio;
    // If no action taken, update mAspectRatio to the corrected ratio
    mAspectRatio = ratio;
}
```

This ensures that the container's aspect ratio from super() remains fixed and only ever gets updated by the user. The container's aspect ratio is updated via getHorizon, and any future calls override it until they've been deprecated.
