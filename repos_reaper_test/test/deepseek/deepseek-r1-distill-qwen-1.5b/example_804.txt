For your versioning to be consistent, each key should contain a unique key. However, I notice that there's a possible duplicate (with two 'unknown protocols') in the put operation for `UnknownProtocolException`. 

If this is intended, I need to know more about the intended merge behavior.

Please clarify if you'd like us to:
1. Remove the duplicate entry
2. Merge the different notNull parameters
Or whatever your intended behavior is.

If you'd like me to leave it as is, our preferred behavior is:
```
When a key is put with duplicate values (different notNull than before), the last one
 WILL overwrite the previous version.
```

Either way, please let us know how the merge/extension conflicts are handled.
