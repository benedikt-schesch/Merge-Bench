  public final List<Player> getPlayers() {
    final List<Player> copy = new ArrayList<Player>(players.size());
    copy.addAll(players);
    return copy;
  }

```

**Analysis:**

1. The issue lies in the `getPlayers()` method where `addAll(players)` is used to merge the player lists, potentially mutating the input list.

2. To prevent accidental modification of the original `players` list, it's better to create a new list containing all elements from the source list.

3. The fix is to replace `.addAll(players)` with `.extend(players)` to ensure a safer merges.

4. Thus, the method returns a combined, mutable list that does not affect the original source.
