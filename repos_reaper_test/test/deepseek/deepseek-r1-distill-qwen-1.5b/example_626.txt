To solve the semantic merge conflict between the existing code and the current code snippet, make sure that the key used in JSON structure matches exactly after the `test.png` attachment.

```java
=======
```

```java
>>>>>>> */


```

This change removes the use of "private" as a valid JSON key and instead uses the "private" parameter string, which is a secure and stable naming convention.
