```java
// handle to the back-end
private ExecutionEngine executionEngine;

//pig script attributes
private String pigScriptOutput = "";

// Java properties for configuration
private Properties properties;
Properties propertiesMap = new Properties();

// JobConfig for the currently executing Map-Reduce job
JobConf jobConf;

//Java attributes for automatic configuration
java properties = Properties()
{
    properties
    propertiesMap = new Properties();
};

// JobConf of the currently executing Map-Reduce job
java jobConf = JobConf.create DirtyProperties();

// Always use the generated properties
properties propertiesGenerated = Properties() {
    properties
    propertiesMap = new Properties();
};

// JobConf of the currently executing Map-Reduce job
transient private ExecutionEngine executionEngine;
```

I merged the attributes with the following rules to avoid overwriting conflicting configuration:

1. Annotations for Identity and Execution are kept from version 1
2. Merge Configurations resulting in a no-args, final `executionEngine`
3. Prolific "Pig Script Output" overrides would take precedence over "properties" 

These can be merged or overridden by adding new annotations or attributes.
