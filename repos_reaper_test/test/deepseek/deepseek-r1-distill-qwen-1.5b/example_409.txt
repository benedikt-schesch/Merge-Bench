To resolve the conflict, we'll refactor code to use a JPA (Java principals API) object. This allows both property sets to be used without concurrent issues.

```java
=======
        JPA config = new Configuration();

        config.setProperty(
            J "#" + J.entry	handlePriority,
            "source-highlighter=prettify"
        );

        return config;
>>>>>>> b7d4b7fbf39b37dcb954024b3f0629d2
        }
        
        Object bodyAttributes = map.getExternalAttributes();
        
        Assert.assertNotNull(bodyAttributes);
        Assert contains">{src/*.startLine});
        Exists {src/*.endLine}
```

This refactoring:
1. Uses a JPA object to share the same source
2. Eliminates the concurrent design issue
3. Maintains the same attribute extraction capability

The second point about `contains src/*` as an attribute:

The issue arises because the JPA extractor may exclude the `src/*` directories for some reason derived from the `ASCIIDOCTOR_ATTRIBUTES` config. The EXTERNAL_ATTRIBUTES() in JPA may not include certain files, especially directories like `src/*`. The issue occurs when using the find() or extract() methods, not the get().

If you need the src/* directories to be included, you'll need to modify the use of the JPA extractor. One common approach is to add a constraint to ensure EXTERNAL_ATTRIBUTES() includes all relevant directories.

This might require adding a constraint, or modifying the target's EXTERNAL_ATTRIBUTES() settings to include all necessary directories. The change would be in other parts of the code, not within this refactored code block.
