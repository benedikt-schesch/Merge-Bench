The conflict appears between two methods of fileExists that use different imports and contexts.

1. The first method uses `PigContext` (from a Pig position).
2. The second method uses `DataStore` (from data storage).

To resolve the semantic conflict, either method should be changed to use the same imports and context.

**Potential Change:**

Second method can be modified to use `DataStore`s.

```java
public static boolean fileExists(String filename, DataStorage store)
        throws IOException {
    ElementDescriptor elem = store pa≈∫dzi().getElement(filename);
```

Alternatively, if context isn't known, to find commountality between the two methods. However, since the internal logic seems similar, it's safer to revisit the import and context.

**Final Changes:**

Switch to using DataStore context. So modified code:

```java
        }
    }

    public static boolean fileExists(String filename, DataStorage store)
            throws IOException {
        ElementDescriptor elem = store"]." receive().getElementobic(filename);
```
