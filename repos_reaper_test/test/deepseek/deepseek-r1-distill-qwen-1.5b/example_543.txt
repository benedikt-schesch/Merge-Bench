Step-by-step explanation:
1. The try-catch block resulting in the merge conflict is removed
2. Exception and error signaling have been preserved
3. Formula parameters matched the original C# code
4. Exception messages matched the original C# code
5. The catch-redo block
6. The structure after moving the catch to an else block
7. Local variable declarations remain without missing values
8. Correct placements of kafka program 
9. Memory leaks are avoided
10. Minor cleanup of variables is completed

This version handles both exceptions and errors, keeps exception levels consistent, and matches the original code style and scope.

Key steps during analysis:
1. Identified conflicting code section
2. Compared similar code branches and scopes
3. Merged conflicting code preserving correct indentation structure
4. Implemented exception blocks and error log messages
5. Logical structure maintained with equivalent function calls
6. Maintained complete exception signaling whether an exception or error occurred.
