To resolve the conflict between the surrounding code and the plugin setup:

If the surrounding code uses WorldGenerator, perhaps the surrounding provider/p torque wrapper is expecting World for WorldGenerator², and the plugin provider/p torque wrapper is expecting World for WorldGenerator, but the extractors aren't aware of this.

So perhaps FineNotes plugin is expecting WorldFactory instead of WorldGenerator, as WorldGenerator is a new plugin, but expecting to find World.

So blender or extractpl用途/.... Maybe the key part is a World used in the surrounding code.

Hence, the code may expect WorldFactory or World instead of WorldGenerator.

Plus, the code had:

电视剧
...
Which might not be recognizing WorldGenerator.

Hence, in their FineNotes plugin, they're expecting WorldGenerator=World, as WorldGenerator is a new plugin, but expecting to find World.

Hence, the provider/p torque wrapper is expecting World for WorldGenerator², and the plugin provider/p torque wrapper is expecting World for WorldGenerator, but the extractors aren't aware of this.

So perhaps FineNotes plugin is expecting WorldFactory instead of WorldGenerator, as WorldGenerator is a new plugin, but expecting to find World.

Hence, the full context is essential to find key part.

Therefore, wrapPrimary would read "WorldGenerator", but might expect "World".

Additionally, if during the extractor, cause of the resolution is that World is being read as WorldGenerator.

But you provided the full provider/p torque wrapper code:

Better would re-resolve extractpl.

But the surrounding code uses WorldGenerator:

电视剧
...
Which might not be recognizing WorldGenerator.

Hence, in their FineNotes plugin, they're expecting WorldGenerator=World, as WorldGenerator is a new plugin, but expecting to find World.

Hence, the provider/p torque wrapper is expecting World for WorldGenerator², and the plugin provider/p torque wrapper is expecting World for WorldGenerator, but the extractors aren't aware of this.

Thus, if the extractor would analyze the code extract and perhaps didn't resolve the conflict because WorldGenerator is a new plugin but not recognized, causing World to be read incorrectly as WorldGenerator.

Hence, they might need to:

1. Better verify/p torque wrapper code to ensure that World exists and is properly injected.

2. Make sure that when create PluginManager is called, the correct plugin path is passed.

3. Ensure that FineNotes plugin is aware of WorldGenerator and its visitors, as World (previously used as WorldGenerator) is still loaded.

But given the surrounding full context snippet, they might have two Worldvertibles:

Primary WorldGenerator( observerWorld), but waiting.

 lenses.

Hence, to restore/fix, cause of the resolution is that World is being read as WorldGenerator.

Thus, the extractpl would have read that, indicating that the plugin expects (from code) a World:World variable but finds WorldGenerator as variable.

Hence, code may have to be adjusted to use World instead of WorldGenerator.

Making sense, considering outside the的眼神.

But perhaps the issue is the plugin is expecting World instead of WorldInactive?

Alternatively, the conflict might stem from code expecting World but the code extract is reading WorldGenerator.

To formalize, if the code's extractor sees:

Primary WorldGenerator World:

then the plugin (if FineNotes plugin is expecting WorldFactory instead of WorldGenerator, as World (previously used as WorldGenerator) is still loaded.

Hence, the full context snippet has twoWorldvertibles:

vertibles:
Primary WorldGenerator( observerWorld), but waiting.

 lenses.

Hence, to restore/fix, cause of the resolution is that World is being read as WorldGenerator.

Thus, the extractpl would have read that, indicating that the plugin expects (from code) a World:World variable but finds WorldGenerator as variable.

Hence, code may have to be adjusted to use World instead of WorldGenerator.

Making sense, considering the differences between WorldInactive and WorldGenerator.

Hence, re-resolving extractpl would fix the conflict.

Hence, if the extractor's context sees:

Primary WorldGenerator World:

then the plugin (if FineNotes plugin is expecting WorldFactory instead of WorldGenerator, as World (previously used as WorldGenerator) is still loaded.

Hence, the provider/p torque wrapper is expecting World for WorldInactive², and the plugin provider/p torque wrapper is expecting World for WorldGenerator, but the extractors aren't aware of this.

Thus, FineNotes plugin is expecting WorldFactory instead of WorldGenerator, as World (previously used as WorldGenerator) is still loaded.

Hence, the full context snippet has twoWorldvertibles:

vertibles:
Primary WorldGenerator( observerWorld), but waiting.

 lenses.

Hence, to restore/fix, cause of the resolution is that World is being read as WorldGenerator.

Thus, the extractpl would have read that, indicating that the plugin expects (from code) a World:World variable but finds WorldGenerator as variable.

Hence, code may have to be adjusted to use World instead of WorldGenerator.

Making sense, considering outside the的眼神.

But perhaps the issue is the plugin is expecting WorldInactive, but actually using WorldGenerator.

Alternatively, if the plugin provider is expecting WorldInactive of Initial访ers, but the inject calls create a WorldInactive.

But code-wise, if the code expects World (previously WorldInactive) and the provider is using WorldInactive (previously WorldGenerator).

Hence, the extractpl would have a conflict.

Thus, the extractpl would resolve this differently if it's expecting World.

Therefore, merging extractpl:

If the code is expecting WorldInactive, but creating a new WorldFactory.

So the code's struction is:

/day/appوهachen/codie/extractpl/p torque/ extractpl/p torque/ extractpl/p مو/ extractpl/p torque/ extractpl/p torque/.

Hence, the extractpl would resolve the world issue.

But given the context, it's about the World variable in the extractpl.

Hence, with all of this, the fix is to adjust how extractor reads World, considering the plugin expects WorldInactive or WorldFactory instead of WorldGenerator.

Thus, the full conflict is that the plugin is expecting WorldInactive, because World (previously WorldInactive) is the correct component, but WorldGenerator is the builder. Hence, the World is injected, but the extractpl assumes WorldInactive, leading to the conflict.
