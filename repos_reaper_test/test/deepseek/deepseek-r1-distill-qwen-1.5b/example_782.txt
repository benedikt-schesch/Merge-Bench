The merge conflict arises as one interface includes `IsEdit` annotation, while another interface likely has a different semiconcept. The `IsEdit` interface defines properties for RPC methods related to modifying HBase data. The Current interface likely has specialized private field/annotations. To resolve, retain the core edit interface while incorporating the affected tags.

```java
/**
 * Package-private interface to mark RPCs that are changing data in HBase.
 * The interface allows for various types of edit operations like MOVE, INSERT
 * and the permission (edited for application/hustman).
 * @停产
 * @_gray
 * @(Tagquipment)
 * @Tagged
 * @ { rights are updated following FermiTag HMS analysis targets.
