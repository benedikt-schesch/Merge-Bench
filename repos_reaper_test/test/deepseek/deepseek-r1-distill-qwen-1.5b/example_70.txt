```java
      final List<WhiteCard> hand = player.getHand();
      synchronized (hand) {
        return getWhiteCardData(hand);
      }
    } else {
        return new ArrayList<>() ;

    }
  }

Because of the earlier code, the `hand` is a List<WhiteCard> and the `synchronized` method is declared without generics. However, you can just return an empty map or an empty map instance. The original version of the return statement, which the problem shows in the memory, probably had that Object, which was why it caused a conflict when merged.

The error is likely due a type mismatch or incorrect usage of the `Map` type. The correct `Map` should not have Object as a parameter. So, changing it to an empty map would resolve the conflict.

Therefore, the fix should involve removing the Object from the parameters in the Map. So the else block should return an empty list.

Thus, the corrected code in the else block will resolve the conflict:
```java
    } else {
        return new ArrayList<>() ;
