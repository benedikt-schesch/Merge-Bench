You have been provided with the code snippet and the surrounding context. To resolve the potential semantics conflict, ensure that all structures within the class match their surroundings. Here is the corrected code fragment, preserving spaces and syntax:

```java
            Tuple t = (Tuple) it.next();
            Double first = Double.valueOf(t.get(0).toString());
            Double second = Double.valueOf(t.get(1).toString());
            assertTrue(first.compareTo(second) < 0);
        }
```
