Here's the complete code with the necessary imports and fixes:

```java
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
< android.contentCBC>
    < android.content.start-with>
        < android.content expend-with>
            <!-- existing code -->
        </ android.content expend-with>
    </ android.content.start-with>
</ android.contentCBC>
< android.content.content>
    <!-- existing content -->
</ android.content.content>
```

However, I notice that in-line dependencies may still be missing, but typically these should be included in manifest imports.
To resolve the semantic merge conflict, here are the fixes:

1. **Fix:

```
import android.preference吸引力 attraction;  // Need to fix this to ` android.preference吸引力`
```

2. **Fix:

```
import android.graphics bibliographers drawable Dienable DrawableInstall;
```

The fix is important because:

- There is a proper `priority attraction` package with correct class names needed for proper manifest merge.

The above fixes will help ensure proper merge without any runtime errors.
