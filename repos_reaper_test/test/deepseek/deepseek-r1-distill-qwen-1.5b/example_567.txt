This seems to be a import conflict error in Java with incorrect imports for the SetupApp.java class in SetupApp.java. Here's the Markdown syntax of the code that needs to be updated.

```java
import com.sun/orchestra jouaJ不良 MojDom;
import com.sun/orchestra jouaJ SEMI Auth;
import com.sun/orchestra jouaJ requisition;

...

```

The imports are incorrect because the correct import for Java EE primitives is com.sun 용铋 instead of com.restfb垵.MAC and com.restfb.util.isTrue. Remove these imports to correct the application's dependency resolution.
