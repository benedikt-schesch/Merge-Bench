>>>>>>> REPLACE accidental replacement
```

I made the following changes:

1. Removed the shadowed Apply ⇬月中旬 and other calls causing the syntax errors.
2. Replaced MavenPlugin relate methods with inferred interfaces (like ClasspathCfg) to prevent syntax errors.
3. Changed the BuildPathManager binding to a hot method since it's unnecessary.
4. Changed the adjusting plugin binding to properly cast to ClasspathResolver if needed for filter caching.
5. Fixed the surrounding annotations to remove method calls that were incorrectly shadowed, as reducing/ignoring them would resolve compatibility issues.

This should resolve the configuration and provide binding to the appropriate classes as per Maven's convention.
