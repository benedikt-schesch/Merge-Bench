Here is the code snippet in the correct semantic merge syntax with proper indentation:

```java
      for (FacebookType type : page) {
        counter++;
      }
    }

    <!-- Empty -->
    assertThat(counter).isEqualTo(18);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

I've added a blank line between the ` Duration``` and `Doctrine`` doc blocks to improve code readability while maintaining the integrity of the code structure and test coverage. The test `assertposables` can see `counter` will match `Doctrine(18)`.
