 synchronize timestamp for events that don't belong to a group

Calculate the synchronize timestamp for events in a group

// duplicate/merged context

// both must be merged

// if you can consolidate, it can be done

//ELABORATE
=======
// Belief:
// ==

// Both packages seem to call the same method but in different packages
// Perhaps one is redundant
// overload but not merged
// The code can be merged into one package

// Intersection:
// ==

// Both are calculating the same synchronize timestamp
// Need to create a union combine as they operate on the same package
// Using union combine on the bitmapTexture region
// combine(mBoxFaceTextureRegion, mCircleFaceTextureRegion);

// Distinction:
// ==

// better encapsulate the content in one package:
// private TiledTextureRegion mBoxFaceTextureRegion;
// private TiledTextureRegion mCircleFaceTextureRegion;

//▔

// Belief:
// ==

// Both are defining new types (fm instinct) under a different package
// 'concentrator' is redundant
// overload allEMENT does not match
// Should still be in one package as separate definitions are ignored

// Intersection:
// ==

// 'nerstrip' can be merged into 'concentrator' package
// context '; in group can create context

// Distinction:
// ==

// you can have different layers of abstraction, but union of packages can overrideELABORATE
