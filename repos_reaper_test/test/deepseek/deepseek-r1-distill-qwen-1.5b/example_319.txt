To resolve the semantic conflict, the `mResponse` variable needs to be properly initialized. Here is the corrected code:

```java
mResponse = "";
public String asString() throws ResponseException {
>>>>>>> cbb20c83a4abae0550321f56101bb216b5c8f5bb
```

**Analysis:**

- **Identified Issue:** The variable `mResponse` was declared to return a `ResponseException` but was initially set to `null`. This emitted a compilation error because the return type didn't match the variable's type.

- **Understanding:** The intention was likely to have a non-null value for `mResponse` to prevent a `ResponseException` from throwing a `NullPointerException`.

- **Suggested Fix:** Set `mResponse` to an empty string `""` to align with its return type and prevent errors.
