The issue in the original code snippet is a syntax error. It has an unbalanced 'if' statement without a valid return type and any closing brace. The code structure needs to be corrected to properly define the methods and any closing braces.

Note that the code outside of the if-if block is missing bracketing. This would likely be a mistake. The original code after the}``边上 any closing brace needs to have valid structure.
