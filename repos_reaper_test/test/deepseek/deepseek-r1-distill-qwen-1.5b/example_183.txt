Wait, the imports added in the right file include itohubFullManager and .ROADS variables, which are used within IHB extends? I'd need to clarify if this is affecting some component.

Could you explain what specific classes and files might be missing?

Also, Are the variables @IHubFullManager and @ROADS needed elsewhere? Are there other issue with resources it mightxDuplicate or?

Could you double check or fix these issues or clear up the confusion?

Also, make sure you check if these imports and variables are necessary, or perhaps clearer/called differently.
