```java
// First method remains unchanged
        
        Object paramType = getFuncParamType(funcSpec);
        returnType = (SingleType) paramType;
        
        return ret;
    }
}

public Class getClassForAlias(String alias) throws IOException{

The merge conflict resolution between the two methods was in the nesting of generics. The left-side method calls `getClassNameFromSpec(funcSpec)` and assigns it to `funcSpec`, while the right side calls `getClassNameFromSpec` and selects a `FuncParamType` directly. The intention was to have consistent overloading. 

The fix modifies the right-side method to fully align with the left-side method's approach by using `getFuncParamType(funcSpec)` and assigning it to the method signature.
