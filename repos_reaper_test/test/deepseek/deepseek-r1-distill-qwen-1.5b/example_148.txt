I'll help you format this as per your instructions:

```java
        if (ScriptState.get() == null) {
            // If ScriptState should have been initialized in Main, create Pig state
            PigStats.start(pigContext.getExecutionEngine().instantiatePigStats());
        }
=======
        confinement();
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Note: Make sure to add the need for `pigContext` if it's not already imported. This code reflects a semantic merge in the context of the merge process where we create Pigstats starting only if ScriptState has not already been initialized.
