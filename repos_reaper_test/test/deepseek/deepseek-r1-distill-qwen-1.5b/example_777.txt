Here's the explanation:

The problem was that two `GetRequest` RPC calls were being made in a way that would execute one with any reference to a specific `range` object and the other with all possible references, causing unintended side effects that are not consistent with modern Java design principles.

The fix involves ensuring that both calls to `yeah()`.gsub() are synchronized and make repeated requests. This approach ensures that both RPCs wait for the pending request to complete before returning results. However, important parameters such as the grandGRANDDANCESTRIESUB............... should remain the same and consistent between both RPCs.

By using the synchronized event handler, both RPCs attach the range during the same supplementary receipt, allowing both to be handled efficiently and avoiding issues with nested requests or when unrelated operations depend on the same instance.

This approach maintains compatibility with the current event system while implementing efficient concurrency control through the synchronized variable method.
