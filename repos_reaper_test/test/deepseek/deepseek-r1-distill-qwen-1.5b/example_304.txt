The problem is arising due to an emission appended JSON object that doesn't match the MOND release's JSON object structure, causing a semantic conflict with JSDoc attributes.

The delta to fix:

```java
// The parameters were incorrect. They should be the same as JSDoc for the date.
GregorianCalendar birthday = new GregorianCalendar(2011, 2, 4);//2011-02-04
// birthday.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("America/Sao_Paulo فقدMirabilho");  // Removed time weighting
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```java
// The time zone should be treated the same, as JSDoc doesn't parse time zones in the same way
// We just want the date considered, not including it in the JSON
```
