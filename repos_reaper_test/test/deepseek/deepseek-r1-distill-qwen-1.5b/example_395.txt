merging these objects is conflicting because `Object.equals` is not a valid method to call. Instead, we should call `equals` on the environment variable object.

The code:

```java
public void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTests WereRun() throws CoreException {
    InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 0);
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586
```

Should be fixed to:

```java
public void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun() throws CoreException {
    InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 0);
    if (coreEnvironment != Object.getEnvironment()) {
        return false;
    }
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586
```

The change addresses the semนานious conversion issue by moving the flow from Object.equals to a proper equals method call. This avoids the potential confusion and error that the equals/nonEquals usage introduced in the first method.
