```java
/**
 * Returns the given string if it is non-null; the empty string otherwise.
 * 
 * @param string
 *            the string to test and possibly return
<<<<<<< SEARCH
     * @return {@code string} itself if it is non-null; {@code ""} if it is null
=======
     * @return {@code string} itself if it is non-null; {@code ""} if it is non-null
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Note: This solution adds a comment clarifying the intent of comparing with null to an empty string, making it explicit.

The sweet spot comes to mind, probably intended as a replacement method, but in this case, the focus was on clarity.
