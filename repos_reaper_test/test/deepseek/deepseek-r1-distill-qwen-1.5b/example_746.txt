        setTranslationX(finalX);

    public void notifySidebarSlideClose() {
            FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getngralledParams();
            animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(
                    SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
        }

        public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {

It appears the first code snippet has a duplicate method call, which is incorrect in Java. The same animation duration and layout parameters requested in the first code don't appear in the second. 

The second code is missing those parameters, causing a fairness conflict. The current code nest
 styling is too close to the slide closure animation.

This is acceptable because the first code is causing unexpected information and the intention clearly matched the second. The session parameters have already been used.

Note that the duplicate method call is wrong in Java. The slash must be removed in `setTranslationX` as shown above. 

The code is for the translation of `"Ü¨_UNICODE"` in the application. The fix makes the same animation parameters to be spread to both slides and the calendar sheet.
