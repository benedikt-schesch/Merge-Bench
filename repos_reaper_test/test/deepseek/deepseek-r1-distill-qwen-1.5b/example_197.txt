To resolve the conflict between these two function calls in the same file. Both functions appear to be attempting to instantiate a functional class based on a given alias (~example). Due to their circular dependency, both invocations would execute, conflicting with each other.

Solution: Remove the second function call within `StringUtil` to eliminate the circular reference.

```java
        }
        return resolveClassName(className);
    }
  

        public Object instantiateFuncFromAlias(String alias) throws IOException {
        String funcSpec;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        if (definedFunctions != null && (funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias)) != null)
            return instantiateFuncFromSpec(funcSpec);
        else
            return instantiateFuncFromSpec(alias);
    }
```

The merge combines the two function calls into one so that `instantiateFuncFromAlias` only executes once, rather than having concurrent invocations.
