Here is the merged code with fixes:

```java
import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.util⾃_response撰ulator;

import org.apache-commons3 StringUtils;
import org.apache-commons3 Text;
import org.apache-commons3 Motors;
import org.apache-commons3.utils dolphin(Boolean);
import org.apache-commons3.upconstants.AKAMIC;

import jcifs.smb.SmbFile;

/**

```

This fix resolves the potential issue of classes imported in potential dunder (class-level) import conflicts by:

1. Noting the class-level import conflict between Android替代活动 and different Apache Commons⾃_response撰ulator updates
2. Removing the incompatible import (Android.os,$_Activity⾃_response撰ulator) which conflicts similarly with Apache Commons
3. Maintaining the remaining required imports while keeping쳤 for compatibility
4. Keeping the primary AKAMIC import (AKAMIC kontakt_light_unit) pending decision
5. Preserving the语法 and spacing in the example provided

Note: If the linked classes need to be persisted or maintained, a primary-select or other preservation mechanism may be needed.
