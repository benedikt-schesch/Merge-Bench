To address the semantic merge conflict between the existing library and the file with the ShortAssert, I have followed these steps:

1. **Identify the Conflict Context**: There's a semantic merge between the existing library and the ShortAssert file where both have the same identifier (`ShortAssert` or `ShortAssert.class`), creating a conflict.

2. **Understand the Desired Outcome**: The goal is to determine which method (protected or non-protected) should take precedence, allowing the library to use the non-protected ShortAssert version.

3. **Retrieve the Conflicting Rules**: I used theConflictParser and the provided `Sepberg.Merges_conflict` context to get the appropriate merge rules.

4. **Update the Merges Rules**: I modified the rules to greet both methods, ensuring the existing ShortAssert from the other file spreads the rules, while adding a shortcut for the non-protected method, which may exist in the same file.

5. **Create the Updated Code**: I created a new `Difficulty.php` file (if necessary) with these merged rules and instructed the user to replace the relevant section in their existing library.

The resulting code uses the non-protected ShortAssert method, spreading the merging rules accordingly.
