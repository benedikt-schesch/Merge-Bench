}
```

This resolution reconciles the two declarations by:
1. Moving the `mStackMargin` from the class (as static final) to an instance variable (final)
2. Adding appropriate comments
3. Maintaining all the functionality
4. Preserving the same context and spacing

Note: It expects your colleague to understand that moving static to instance is causing a merge conflict. Your colleague should know how to support this move to mitigate the issue.
