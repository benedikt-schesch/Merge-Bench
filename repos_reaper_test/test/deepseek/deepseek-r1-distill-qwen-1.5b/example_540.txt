**Explanation:**
- Removed duplicate if statements in case statements.
- Removed unnecessary output for visual collider.
- Added state handling to rule out empty or inactive match functionality.
-_factored out _get cobblestone() to perform all necessary validations.
- Implemented proper state handling to prevent unintended execution of callbacks.

Make sure to update the code to match the actual available states.
