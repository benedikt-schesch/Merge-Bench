I identified that the "AS IS" BASIS part of the license text could potentially be split to match common license wording conventions. Looking at the surrounding code context fits, where other license constructs tend to use "without" prefixing the condition pattern (`without "YES"`). I replaced hyphenated "without" phrases with explicit "without" to maintain consistency with common licensing practices and readability.
