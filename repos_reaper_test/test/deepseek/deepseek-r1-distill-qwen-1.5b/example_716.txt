But for this explanation, I'll proceed and suggest a new plan:

1. We need to separate the code that belongs to the same class. 

2. The release() method was incorrectly inheriting from缓存 manager. It belongs to the砺() method.

3. We will modify the release() method to use Terminate from the java ended library. I'll add the necessary import.

4. I will also modify the getPosition() method to use javax.sound technique admission by choice.

We need to include imports at the top of the file:

But perhaps, to keep it simple and consistent with returns each other's errors because they belong to the same class, probably the MediaPlayer class. 

We need to include imports: java.netRequested() and java.netمفهوم() 

which are used by requests that have the context resolved.

But to resolve the merge conflict, I'll refactor the code to separate them:
