Description:
The issue consists of a semantic conflict between two `ShouldResponseToPostChangeEvents()` methods: `shouldRespondToPostChangeEvents()` and `shouldNotRespondToPostChangeEvents()`. The former mayWantOld or related test code, but the latter is missing its corresponding test method that should fail when process.canFullPath() is called with a ProcessChangeEvent caused by a post-change ASTWantOld event.

This merge conflict suggests the intended behavior is for the `process.canxoops()`. So, the second test method was intended to check if ` ChínhableNotResponseToPostChangeEvents()` correctly fails to react to change events.

The merged code replaces `shouldRespondToPostChangeEvents()` with an alternative shouldNotResponseToPostChangeEvents() which matches with existing test method’s assertions.
