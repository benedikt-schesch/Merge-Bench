Here's the updated snippet with a draft that incorporates your request: `<not yet determinate> but let's see. Wait, this is the code from @loodset or purchases or some other project. Changing the `@param v` could cause issues elsewhere. Send a message to the team.</not yet determinate>

```
/**
 * @param v
 * @deprecated use {@link WithHeaderActivity#setRefreshAnimation(boolean)}
 */
  
protected void animRotate(View v) {
    <!-- The rest of the code -->
}

/**
 * Start/Stop Top Refresh Button's Animation
 */
  
    /**
     * Start/Stop Top Refresh Button's Animation
     * 
     * preserveVertices parameter is true
     */ 
```

Note: The snippet appears to have two @param v declarations, which suggests that `v` is the parameter for a Video video. I would advise checking inheritance or usage context. If issues persist, we can be more specific. Include any additional context or notes you see, and I can adjust this accordingly.
