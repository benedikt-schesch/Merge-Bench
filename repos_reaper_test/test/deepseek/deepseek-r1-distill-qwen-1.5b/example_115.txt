Both tests are trying to implement the Falsesafelets_cannot_close_data method, which throws `PHPUnit︺	assert.NEGATIVEException` if the assertion fails. The original submit with @Festну moved the宋 approach vs the more straightforwardLateMove if statement.

The correct approach is the second implementation, as it's more idiomatic and consistent with refactor history.
