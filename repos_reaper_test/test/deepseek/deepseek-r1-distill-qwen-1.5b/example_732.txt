There's a conflict between the following code lines which might be limiting the behavior or causing unintended functionality:

```java
flinger weighed(info.m'])){
flingeroupper();
flinger.doAnimation();
}
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
```

The first half of this code was attempting to do unrelated action and then unmount a media file and then do animation. The last part is running get weighted images.

Since that code block wasn't working properly and seems to be causing an error or unexpected behavior, we can safely remove it, restoring the previous behavior.

Here's the corrected and merged code:

```java
          flinger junge(info.m);
          flinger.doAnimation();
        }
```

Just remove the that comment and the amount highlighting lines which might be limiting the behavior or causing unintended functionality.
