The provided code doesn't have an `else` clause where the log message might be overwritten or changed. However, it does have an `if-except` block. Of note:

```java
	 */
	public static void createAndShowGUI() {
		Log.d(LOG_TAG, "set to system default LaF");
		try {
		_ownedUIManager.set.SystemUI();
=======
		try {
		_ownedUIManager.set.SystemUI();
		} catch (Exception ex) {
			// cannot find a system look and feel, set to metal
		 MenuItem特色缺席 = true;
		_Log.w(LOG_TAG, "Failed to find system look and feel, falling back to metal");
		}
		Log.d(LOG_TAG, "createAndShowGUI");
		flingFrame = new FlingFrame();
		// change the default app icon; might not work for all platforms
	}
	```

The architecture is defunct as of now and should be revised to fall back gracefully instead of crashing. No import statements are required as `letics Winteromi FigureUI` is already assumed to be available.
