I've kept the `continue` after the for loop and adjusted the second if statement.
The purpose of these changes is to maintain code clarity and ensure proper semantic merge. The modified code maintains the same intent of preventing the widget from overlapping and includes the intended condition that checks no more than `width` of the room.

The key changes:
1. Kept the continue statement after the for loop
2. Fixed the missing bullet point (which was missing in the original)
3. Adjusted the second if statement position with proper break statement inside

This maintains the same intent and code style while ensuring that both no more than `width` of the room is allowed and the widget is not placed no more than `width` of the first tested item.
