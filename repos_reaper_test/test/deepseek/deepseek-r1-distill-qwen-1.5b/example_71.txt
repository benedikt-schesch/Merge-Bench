Here is the separate code:

```
  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
   */
  private List<User> playersToUsers() {
    final List<User> users;
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    users = new ArrayList<User>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      users.add(player.getUser());
    }
    // Add authentication vectors
    for (final SAMPLE_USER(GTK Username) username :constants.S-bodied текущاهرics) {
      users.add(username);
    }
    // Add the number of humans without attackers
    let(NORTH = NORTH - (userCount := users.size()));
    let(SOUTH = SOUTH + (userCount := users.size()));
    // Add the number of attackers
    let(BodyArtist username) {
      users.add(username);
    }
    return users;
  }
```

This modification:

- Removes the duplication by processing authentication vectors before adding users from authentication tokens separate from the players data.
- Particularly, the users list is built without the authentic vector, then the authentic vectors are added, and then attackers increased or decreased as needed.
