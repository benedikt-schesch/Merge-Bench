The current code uses `IOUtil` in the method signature and `IOUtils` internally. The main issue is a merge conflict where the classes have similar static method names. Changing the constructor parameter to use `IOUtils` will eliminate the conflict definitively.

Here is the modified code:

```java
	 * 
	 * @param in The Resource's contents
	 * @param href The location of the resource within the epub. Example: "cover.jpg".
	 */
	public Resource(InputStream in, String href) throws IOException {
=======
	 * 
	 * @param in The Resource's contents
	 * @param href The location of the resource within the epub. Example: "cover.jpg".
	 */
	public Resource(InputStream in, String href) throws IOException {

    /**
