```java
private final String text;
private final int draw;
private final int pick;
private final String watermark;

// Correction:
*- Remove `Custom` prefix from base class. It's better to have:
- Name `CardcastBlackCard` to indicate it extends Card cast
- Use `Card castBlackCard` as the correct class name for Card cast type implementations
- `CustomBlackCard` should extend `Card cast` not `Card custom`
- Implement the semantic merge as per requirements

public CardcastBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick, final String watermark) {
}
