Here's the corrected code snippet with the necessary changes to resolve the semantic merge conflict and preserve the original structure and spacing:

```java
    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getComments());
    Comments comments = exampleRating.getComments();
    assertEquals("chronological", comments.order()..getBounds().orElse());

    assertTrue(comments.getCanComment());

    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getLikes());
    Likes likes = exampleRating.getLikes();
    assertEquals(0L, likes.getTotalCount().longValue());
    assertTrue(likes.getCanLike());
```

Changes made:
1. Removed the redundant and erroneous lines that were being merged with the original (they ended up in the incorrect place)
2. Kept the lines that where in the incorrect place (that had the can comment and can like method declarations) where they were not in line with the original context
3. Maintained the proper spacing between the lines that correspond to the original context
4. Kept the suggested line (can comment method) as part of the new snippet as it matches the original code

The correct version of the code snippet includes all the relevant methods without including the merged portions.
