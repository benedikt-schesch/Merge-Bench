To resolve the shared semantic merge instruction between the provided class and the test, here's the corrected code with treatment of the merge conflict:

```java
  }

  @Test(expected = SummaryMappingException.class)
  public void checkInvalidJSON() {
    User
  }

  @Test(failureLess = SummaryMappingException.class)
  public void checkInjectError() {
    try {
      Connection<User> connection = new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST).connection("{", {
        //...
      });
    } catch (SummaryMappingException e) {
      assertTrue(e.getMessage().equals("expected JsonKey Summary Eggs:\nexampleology-oops"));
    }
  }
```

This constructs the injection mapping correctly while resolving the merge conflict. It also uses the best practices and adds test classes for better code quality.
