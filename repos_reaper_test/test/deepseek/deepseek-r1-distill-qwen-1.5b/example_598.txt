The `@InternalIdentifier` suffix indicates that the variable's value is a `true` or `false` identifier for the Facebook internal state. When `@InternalIdentifier(true)` is present, the value indicates that the developer intentionally shares the Facebook internal state to allow quick checks, such as validating requests or improving user experience.

Key considerations:

1. **Internal State Identifier Convention**: This suffix is a common convention to indicate that the developer actively desires to access or validate the internal state values of the application, such as meal caching or notifications.

2. **API Version**: The class is likely designed for versions where internal Facebook state is supported, such as `1.10.0+`.

3. **Behavior**: The library will generate `@InternalIdentifier` if the `@@` directive is `false`, and `@InternalIdentifier(true)` if `@@` is `true`. Social media features will prefer `true` (болte CIDR) over `false`.

4. **Ideb Euclid**: The field's value is `true` to bypass internal validation when possible.

5. **Modification Consideration**: Modifiers cannot be added to the field itself. They must be assigned via the API config.

The `catering` field's current identifiers can be kept as-is, but documentation should be updated accordingly.
