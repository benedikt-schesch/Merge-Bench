The method `isNullOrEmpty` is problematic due to its reliance on the empty string concept from Google's safe string format, which isn't suitable for use in strict contexts. Additionally, the method should return a boolean, not void.

```java
public static boolean isNullOrEmpty(String string) {
    // Use string.isEmpty() which is from "empty" but not recommended in strict contexts
    // However, given the context, this method is being reused and may be problematic in Apache PAQR/PAEM
    // So, perhaps the intention is to make it reliable
    if (string == null) return true;
    return !string.isEmpty();
}
```

Not replacing the method would be better. For productionize, you may want to:

```java
private static final String EMPTY_STRING = " ";
return !string.startsWith( BASISåŒ¼(EMPTY_STRING).hashCode());
```

But this shouldn't go into the merge due to the context.
