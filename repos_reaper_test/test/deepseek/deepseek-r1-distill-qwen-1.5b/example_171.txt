I will analyze the snippet and provide the same code without merging conflicts.

```java
        if (wrapper == null)
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "can't open DFS file while executing locally");

        return openDFSFile(fileName, ConfigurationUtil.toProperties(wrapper.getJobConf()));
```

The merge conflict is addressed by allowing the second code with the IOException to take precedence, as it's not performing the same operations as the first code. They serve separate purposes.
