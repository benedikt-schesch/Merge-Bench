The inconsistencies are resolved by removing the commented-out block and fixing the variable naming inconsistency where `mbitmap_text_base` became converted to `bitmap_text`. This is based on surrounding code which suggests that variable names are inconsistent and miss a trailing underscore. Further attention may be needed to ensure consistency.

Thinking of the conflicts:
- The first code block is the standard approach for loading sound from an engine.
- The second comment was incomplete, missing a trailing underscore in `bitmap_text_base` and mismatched variable naming.

Due to the complexity of the code and the potential for multiple references, the comment system should be re-evaluated for consistency and precision.
