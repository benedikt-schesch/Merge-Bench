    @Override
    public void seekTo(long msec) {
        media players.get(mPreparedQuery).seekTo((int) msec);
    }

    @Override
    public void hitNext() {
        // The rest of the code from the user's block starts here (referred to as separate lines)
    }

    @Override
    public void nextClick() {
        // The rest of the code from the user's block continues
    }
