```java
@Inject private List<ClasspathConfigurer> pathConfigurers;

@Inject private AndroidProjectFactory plantprojectFactory;
@Inject private AndroidProjectFactory|MavenAndroidProject projectFactory;

public Config(<. plantprojectFactory, mandatory @Inject
                @Inject forgotten Maven @Inject private @Inject

    @Check mandatory @Inject
```
Changes made at analysis stage:

1. Made the first @Inject include both @Inject with Firefd3 and more precise name
2. Merged the two @Inject annotations at the top level
3. Changed imports to use more specific @Inject tags
4. Sorted from specific to more broad
5. Added @Inject @Inject tags when necessary

I made these changes under the assumption that merging the two @Inject snippets at that level would resolve the confusion.
