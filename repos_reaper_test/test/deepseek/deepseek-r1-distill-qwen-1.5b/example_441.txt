In summary, the solution associates a priority to the focus on field triggers. The problematic line is serialized and deserialized every time it is focused on. The first focus on field is prioritized with higher priority than the subsequent focus on field application triggers. The standard method provided by the textHelper is provided to deserialize the problematic line. This is then passed to the application trigger.
