The code snippet shown includes:
1. An import statement from `java` which contradicts the import from `spring` as seen before
2. An import package `off` which does not exist
3. A target package path `org.apache.pig.test` rather than a pillar project
4. Some pig syntax with the `org.apache.pig.*` import which is incomplete Java syntax but the Spring/JAP combination beforehand

The merge should improve the pig code by:
- Running thepig stack modulus to get proper pig syntax but without date-related interfaces
- Using the activity-based application structure for better compatibility within pig project community
- Still using existing Java imports and fully qualified names of pillar projects
- Using simple Java imports but the Spring/JAP combination beforehand makes this hard to integrate

If you're interested, you can merge the modulus to get proper pig syntax but without date-related interfaces:

```java
È©¨Êù•Ë•ø‰∫ö„Åù„Åó„Å¶
```

Scenario with optimal import resolution:
```java
import static org.apache.pig.datalist.PiLink;
import org.apache.pigÁì¢;

// Merge conflict-free pig imports:
// [best practices for merging]

```
