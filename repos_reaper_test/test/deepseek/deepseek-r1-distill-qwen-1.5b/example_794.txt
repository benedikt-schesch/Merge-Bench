**Explanation of the change:**

- **Issue Identification and Analysis:** The call to `buf.skipBytes(length)` skips a number of bytes but does not advance the reference manager. This could cause issues when reading data by pointer offset.

- **Identifying the Problematic Line:**
  - **Line:** `buf.skipBytes(length);`
  - **Problem:** This skips bytes but doesn't advance the reference manager, leading to potential buffer pointer offset errors.

- **Solution Proposal:** Introduce a new method `ensureReadable(byte[] buf, int length)` that calls `buf.markReaderIndex()`, resets the reference manager, and increments the offset to ensure the buffer is properly managed.

- **Purpose of the Method:**
  - **_markReaderIndex():** This method marks the beginning of the next醴able's data, enhancing readability for use cases like counting read operations.
  - **resetReaderIndex():** Resets the reference manager between different works.
  - **incrementReferenceContext()->offset:** Addresses any buffer offset after reading, preventing unnecessary buffer overflows or miscalculations.

- **Reasoning:** This provides a robust solution that not only skips the required bytes but also advances the reference manager, ensuring correct operation and consistency with the rest of the system.
