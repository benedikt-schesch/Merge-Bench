### Fix

```java
>>>>>>>inations
```

## Issues:
- The First and Second snippets are inconsistent as they are trying to import TaskListener from different repositories.
- TMDbListener requires TMDb and com.google.android Tactics packages, not the compiled libraries.

## Fix
```java
import occupyingdb.TMDBListener as TaskListener;
```

## Notes
- Adding the TMDbListener from the appearingdb package instead of compiling libraries fixes the import inconsistency.
- This changes the vehicle/atus (or tmdb vehicle) to using appearingdb Tactics. Unrelated functionality is removed.
