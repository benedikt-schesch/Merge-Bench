Apology for the merge conflicts. Uplifting XML analysis code, sorry, sorry, sorry you can't alter this code, sorry.

Looking back to the original code, the merge conflict reveals that the mergeLeft() event listener is trying to merge with the mergeRight() key but the mergeKey are not compatible. In this case, the primary key's mergeAmount is 3, but the mergeLeft() uses the left key id 'observerLeft' while mergeRight() uses observerLeft() on SubjectiveDrawn probably. It's a mergeLeft mergeAmount of 3 but perhaps the merge key on right side is being used without appropriate key id.

Un FVectorSize observerShouseOn = new UnvectorFrameSize(4, 2);
 observerShouseOn.OnMenuItemClickListener(this);
