To resolve the merge conflict, we can modify the code to avoid merging the two maps. The possible problem is that the two `_map` instances are being declared but not necessarily merged, but combining them could cause confusion. Here's the code after the merge conflict is fixed, ensuring no conflict exists:

```java
	private final Map<Integer, Widget> spoutMessages = new HashMap<>();
	// The hashmap that contains the plugin's debug messages
	private final Map<Plugin, Widget> messages = new HashMap<>();

	public DebugScreen() {
		plugin = Spout.getPluginManager().getMetaPlugin();
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification resolves any potential merge conflict by avoiding the code that would attempt to merge these two maps.
