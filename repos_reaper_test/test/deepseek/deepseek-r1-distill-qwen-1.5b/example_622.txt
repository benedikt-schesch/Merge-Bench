The issue appears to be in this part of the code where JsonMapping.getNames() is being called. Replace it with the corrected names() method.

```java
    }

    try {
      List<MessageTag> resultList = new ArrayList<MessageTag>();
      JsonObject rawMessageTagsObject = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(rawTags, JsonObject.class);
        String tagArrayString = rawMessageTagsObject.names().toString();
        for (String tag : tagArrayString) {
=======
      return resultList;
    } catch (FacebookJsonMappingException je) {

```

This code creates a list of MessageTags from the JSON string list. Correct error and capitalization is made. Replace the JsonMapping.getNames() call with names() to correctly get the names as a List<String>. 

The rest of the code inside the loop works as is once the name retrieval issues are fixed.

 island wrapped in the FBJsonMappingException catch block is error-prone and may not handle the exception properly. However, the loop code should remain intact until the exception handling part.

This code changes make proper use of the names() method and adds the tag list elements correctly before adding them to the resultant list.
