```java

    @Provides
    List<RawClasspathConfigurer> provideRawClasspathConfigurers(AttatchSourcesClasspathosing removeSourcesConfigurer) {
>>>>>>> 4b0f0ad0ce6afc98a1fc78b9fe46584c41f478e8
```

Thought process:
1. Looking at the code snippet, the issue is probably related to a typo in a parameter name
2. The `AttatchSourcesClasspathosing` is likely ` AttatchSourcesClasspathConfigurer` due to a spelling mistake
3. This can cause a merge conflict because the two parameters look similar but need to be separated
4. The original code mistakenly includes it as a provider for configuration classes instead of a classpath configurator
5. I assumed this is the case since the surrounding code doesn't make sense of its use
