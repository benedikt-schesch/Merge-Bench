To resolve the semantic merge conflict, the import of `org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType` should be removed. This is because it is incorrectly imported alongside tools used for PIG-specific infrastructure, which should instead be from a different Tomcat plugin source. Instead, the relevant TomCAT plugins should be analyzed separately in the imports.
