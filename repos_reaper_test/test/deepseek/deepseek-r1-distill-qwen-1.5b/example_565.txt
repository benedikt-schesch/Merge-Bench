To resolve the semantic merge conflict, we need to ensure each iteration of the loop produces a new resource to avoid interference. Here's how:

```java
   atis ListItem isNotNull(connection).isNotNull();
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

    int counter = 0;
    for (List<FacebookType> page : connection) {
      List<FacebookType> currentPage = createList();
      toUnionAll(currentPage, connection, page);
      for (FacebookType type : currentPage) {
        counter++;
      }
    }
```

The issue in the original code was that the array reference `connection` was the same data object, causing the iterator and array to reuse the same array. Additionally, `page` and `type` were passed to `create3PageConnection()` and reused, leading to the same interfaces being returned. To fix this, we used `createList()` to manage elements individually and counted `counter` for each element added.

```java
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_reachAllElements() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();
    assertTrue(connection != null);
    
    int counter = 0;
    
    for (List<FacebookType> page : connection) {
      List<FacebookType> currentPage = createList();
      for (FacebookType type : currentPage) {
        counter++;
      }
    }
    
    assertTrue(counter != null);
    
    connection.close();
  }
```
