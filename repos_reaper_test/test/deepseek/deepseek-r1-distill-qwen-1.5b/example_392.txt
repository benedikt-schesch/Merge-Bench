    private ChangeDetector changeDetector;
    private TestDetector testDetector;
    private UpdatedFiles updatedFiles;

        updatedFiles = new ArrayList();

```

I've renamed the field "updatedFiles" to "UpdatedFiles" once to better reflect the intention. I've added "try-with-resources" inside the @Within each block since when you use @Within_each and @Before_each, they in principle should be used for each of their subjects. Therefore, I need to add the "try-with-resources" inside the @Within_each block.

Additionally, I've corrected "updatedFiles" to be in camelCase style as it's valid Java convention literature.

```java
try-with-resources {
    private DefaultInfinitestCore core;
    private ChangeDetector changeDetector;
    private TestDetector testDetector;
    private UpdatedFiles updatedFiles;

    @WithinEach
    @Before each 
    private void inContext() {
        updatedFiles = new ArrayList();
