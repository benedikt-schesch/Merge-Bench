The code snippet below shows a potential semantic merge conflict:

```java
            "short", "integer", "long");

    private static final List<String> decimalTypes = Arrays.asList("float",
            "double");

=======
            "short", "integer", "long");

    private static final List<String> decimalTypes = Arrays.asList("float",
            "double");

            // Convert "short" and "long" to lowercase if媒体TypeAsString was originally in title case.
            // However, note that "FloatingPoint" and "Double" might need further resolution.

        MetadataService ms = new MetadataService();
        MediaType mediaType = MediaType.valueOf(mediaTypeAsString);
        if (!supportedExtensions.contains(ms.getExtension(mediaType))) {
            return null;
        }
```

If you would like me to help resolve this conflict or if the merging in the given code or further context to properly align the code semantics, please feel free to add more details.
