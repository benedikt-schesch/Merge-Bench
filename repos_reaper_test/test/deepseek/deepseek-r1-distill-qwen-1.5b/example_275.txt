I'll analyze the snippet and surrounding context as explained in thought above.

The code uses the-system interface approach to handle merging of PhysicalOps realized by the initial PhysicalPlan.

No semantic conflict detected.

Here's the complete code as immutable syntax, including the fix:

```java
private void mergeOneReducePlanWithIndex(PhysicalPlan from,
        PhysicalPlan to, int initial, int current, byte mapKeyType) throws VisitorException {
    POPackage pk = (POPackage) from.getRoots().get(0);
    from.remove(pk);
    if (fromPkgr instanceof MultiQueryPackager) {
        return;
    }
    addShiftedKeyInfoIndex(initial, fromPkgr);
}```
