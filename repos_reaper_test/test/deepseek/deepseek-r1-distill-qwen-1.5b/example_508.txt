To fix the semantic merge conflict, both `FaceSprite1` and `Face Sprite2` methods should be merged into a single drawing logic in the `Face sprite`. 

Here's the refactored code:

```java
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
			}
		}
		ried_Pront_Pgent_P Cro```

Note that both calls to `this.draw()` are now part of the same `Face sprite` drawing logic. Also, Ensure that the import object `DynamicSpriteBatch` is updated to remove the duplicate creation of `DynamicSpriteBatch`. 

However, the correct refactoring would typically involve merging the two draw calls into a single one, which is done in live code. For the purpose of this exercise, the refactored code outlines the correct usage where both faces are drawn in a semantically consistent manner.
