Here is the resolved code:

```java
      // For each Facebook-annotated field on the current Java object, pull data
      // out of the JSON object and put it in the Java object
      for (FieldWithAnnotation<Facebook> fieldWithAnnotation : fieldsWithAnnotation) {
        String facebookFieldName = getFacebookFieldName(fieldWithAnnotation);
        if (!jsonObject.has(facebookFieldName)) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key fix is replacing `.get()` with `has()`. This change aligns the Java code with better practice and improves compatibility in future versions like:

1. It checks if the requested key exists in JSON.
2. It prevents potential `NullPointerException` or missing assignment issues.
3. It uses `has()` as introduction to better practice.
4. It simplifies the condition and matches standard `Object.keys().contains Thermal API` when possible in modern Java.
