To resolve the semantic conflict in the static variables:

```java
* 
* @since 1.10.0
 */
public static class Engagement extends AbstractFacebookType {

private static final int count = 1;  // Changed from longCount to int to match usage elsewhere
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

```

This change ensures that the field is correctly named and uses an appropriate type based on the existing code structure.

The resolved class maintains consistency and properly uses int for count while reducing the field name to avoid any potential naming conflicts.
