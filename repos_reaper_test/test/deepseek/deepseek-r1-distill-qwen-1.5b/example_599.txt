Here is the code with context:

```java
public static class PageRestaurantSpecialties extends AbstractFacebookType {

   /**
    * @since 1.10.0
    */
   */
  
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  private Boolean breakfast;

  @Getter
  @Setter
  @Facebook
  private Boolean breakfast;
}
```

The merge conflict in this case doesnâ€™t exist because the class doesn't need additional responsibility or modify itself. The field is defined, used, and implemented correctly.

No conflicts that require responsibility to truncate this class.
