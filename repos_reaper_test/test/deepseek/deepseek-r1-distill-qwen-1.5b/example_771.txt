For example, in a transaction where it can't be enforced to write the 'delete the value only when the timestamp expires' step automatically, it may be better to do like this. Alternatively, he can comment this out andproceed with just the 'delete in this time' step, Sorry-if the user can understand, I try to promote his request with this to avoid redundancy.)

The conflict that exists in this code is that the two boolean variables `WHOLE` and `[at_timestamp_only]` are declared in the same class but with different scopes. `WHOLE` declares as a static final byte[] in a top-level, while `@at_timestamp_only` is a private boolean without modifiers. This creates a no-nothing interaction as they can't relate to each other. Additionally, `WHOLE` is declared globally, which might conflict with Symfony's custom first-nightline API logic.
