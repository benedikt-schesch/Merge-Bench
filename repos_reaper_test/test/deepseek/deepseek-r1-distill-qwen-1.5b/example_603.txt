Here is the code snippet after resolving the issue:

```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPictureJsonObject == null)
      return;

    String picJson = rawPictureJsonObject.get("data").toString();

    picture = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(picJson, ProfilePictureSource.class);
  }
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed `rawPicture` to the correct field that's a JsonObject
2. Changed `rawPicture.get("data")` to `rawPictureJsonObject.get("data")` to get the JsonObject

Both lines now correctly use JSON structure and encapsulate the data under the key "data".

Resolving the merge conflict by fixing incorrectly casting to JSON.
