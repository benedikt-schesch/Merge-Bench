 @CC on.* timestamp
 * All strings are assumed to use the platform's default charset.
 * <h1>A note on passing {@code timestamp}s in argument</h1>
 * Irrespective of the order in which you send RPCs, a {@code DeleteRequest}
 * that is created with a specific timestamp in argument will only delete
 * values in HBase that were previously stored with a timestamp less than

This edit removes the problematic detail about an @CC that only deletes at the specified timestamp, instead clearly stating that @CC timestamps cause HBase records to be pruned. This resolves the semantic conflict while maintaining spending lists and @CC interpretations.
