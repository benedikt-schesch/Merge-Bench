Here is the correct structure focusing on the class declaration. There's no code provided that leads to a merge conflict focusing on incorrect scope issues. However, if `hasPermission` wasn't declared abstract or couldn't be set, we might need to do that. But in this case, it's already declared correctly.

The structure is already correct:

```java
public static class VoipInfo extends AbstractFacebookType {

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  private Boolean hasPermission;
```

No conflicts beyond this, so no changes are needed.
