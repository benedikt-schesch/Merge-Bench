The issue lies in an incomplete closing brace for the publicEvent case. The `return` statement contains an if block that should be properly closed with a `}`. Without this, it results in an unbalanced brace error during parsing, creating a conflict during semantic resolution.

```java
        return event.payload.action + " " + "<b>" + event.repo.name + "#" + event.payload.issue.number + "</b>";
      case MemberEvent:
        return " " + event.payload.action + " " + "<b>" + event.payload.member.login + "</b>" + " " + " to " + event.repo.name;
      case PublicEvent:
        if (event.repo != null) {
          return " <b>made</b> " + event.repo.name + " <b>public</b>";
        }
        return "";
      } else {
        return "";
      }
      case PullRequestEvent:
        String action = event.payload.action;
```
