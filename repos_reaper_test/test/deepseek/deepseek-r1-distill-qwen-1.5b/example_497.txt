Here is the resolved code snippet outlining the merge and its semantic context:

```
// Fields
// ===========================================================

private bitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;

private int mFaceIDCounter;
private final SparseArraySprite mFaces = new (
    private final SparseArraySprite>();


```

The ITS analysis identifies the existing fields and the potential conflict. The mCamera field is removed because it wasn't referenced elsewhere, while the mBitmapTexture field is kept as it is essential. Additionally, the mBitmapTextureAtlas field is removed as it pertains to AtmosphericBridge without existing handling and its removal allows for better separation of concerns.
