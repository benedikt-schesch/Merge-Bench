To resolve the semantic merge conflict, the first snippet should be removed because it isn't part of the same dependencies. The second part can be adjusted as shouldMerge=false, with the alpha logic corrected.

```java
setTranslationY(finalPos);
if (getAlpha() == 0.0f) {
    setVisibility(view gesti√≥nktion);
    setAlpha(1.0f);
}
```
