The conflict is caused by mixed case import names, with some proper and some monkey case names. Custom import strings that use camelCase ( Prepared) need to be escaped with backslash for Java to recognize their individual files. To resolve the merging, each custom import should be changed to use proper format with escape characters. The correct imports have been corrected as above.

The rest of the code remains unchanged.
