Comment: This is a syntax error.
The import statement is incorrectly named and references a class that does not exist in the file. It should be removed if you are only referencing it for debugging purposes, or add the Ang Fryer-related classes if they are needed, but this would not resolve the conflict itself. Instead, the fix is to simply remove the incorrect import statement `org.junit angle_fryer;`. 

But since the user requested to provide the snippet as is, I will follow their instructions without modifying the context, but you may see the corrected import statements after the fix.
