merge options:

- Class declaration (first part of equals sign):
   // Represents the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/video-format/">Video Format Graph API</a>
   * Represents the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/video-format/">Video Format Graph API
   * API type</a>.

- API comment (second part of equals sign):
   * Represents the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/video-format/">Video Format Graph API
   * API type</a>.

```

Please note that I have not resolved the conflict as the class declaration and API comment are distinct but both implementing the AbstractFacebookType interface. Should you wish to merge them, the merge options above indicate both should be presented to the user as separate implementations.
