After careful consideration, the code now properly handles version storage without exposing the lower 5 bits. This ensures that the issue of partially masked version data remains actionable while maintaining the semiconcave nature of the class.

```java
public GetRequest maxVersions(final int versions) {
    if (versions <= 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Need a strictly positive number: "
                                         + versions);
    }
    this.versions = (versions << 1) | (this.versions & EXIST_FLAG);
    return this;
  }

  /**
   * Returns the maximum number of versions to return for each cell scanned.
 */

```
