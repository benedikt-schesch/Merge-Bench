The conflict arises between Java Security Portal (JSP) and JsonMapping class naming. Here's the best approach:

```java
import com.restfb.Facebook as com.f vs import com.restfb.JsonMapping as com McGregor;
import org Reneqb:
```

Make the following changes:

1. In one file keep `com.restfb` (if it's being used as a securityÈÅΩ when the JSON issue is resolved)

2. Remove `com.restfb.JsonMapping` when the JSON issue is resolved.

This maintains compatibility with JSON mapping while resolving security concerns.
