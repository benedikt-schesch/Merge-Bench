  public static class MailingAddress extends AbstractFacebookType {

The confusion was due to duplicate formatting syntax with two class declarations which needed resolve. The duplicate at the top caused validation issues, and removing the duplicate while maintaining proper class organization helps avoid the conflict. The changed code from lines a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe to the corrected version maintains the correct class structure.
