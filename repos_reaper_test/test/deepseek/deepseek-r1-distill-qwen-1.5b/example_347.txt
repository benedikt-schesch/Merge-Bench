```java
        assertEquals(renderingControlLastChange.toString(), "");
        mp.setMute(true);
        Thread.sleep(500);
        lastChangeExpected =
        "<Event xmlns=\"urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0("//RCS/\">" +
        "<InstanceID val=\"0\" val=\"0\"/>" +
        "<Mute channel=\"Master\" val=\"1\"/>" +
        "</Event>";

```

The code has had a merge conflict where two asserts attempting to access mutually exclusive data points are having a conflict. The merge is resolved by downtating the reference when the assertion to the event is conditional. This ensures that the logic can be safely combined without relying on the event, while preserving the mute state.
