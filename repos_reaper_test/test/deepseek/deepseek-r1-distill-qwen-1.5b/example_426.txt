** Resolution note: The issue was that the package `android.app切入点` is required for certain Android utilities likephoto manipulation and API access. However, the bundle is already in the `android.app` package, which is not conflicting with `strument`. The package declaration actually has a comment (#* limitations under the License) which may have been misplaced or misunderstood. This comment probably needs to be verified, but in this response, we remove it and update the ` android.app инвести.stackframes` package to ensure proper import hierarchy. Valid conclusion: The package declaration does not contain an ambiguous or invalidila conflict, it's just misarchitectural naming restriction in Some.android package. We should remove the package declarationPID main and action imports and include investments.stackframes.'
