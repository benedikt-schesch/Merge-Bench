The inconsistencies in the method names can be confusing. It appears that the developer intended to call `mMetaBuilder` when there should potentially be a column added to the database. The `crossing` and `getDrawable` patterns here may be out of date. I would strongly suggest using properiastring syntax instead of these patterns. A more appropriate name could be `mLabelBuilder` for the inaccurate airport. Also, the term `cage` is not a valid Java resource qualifier and requires escaping.

After **deactivating** the developer's intention, it's recommended to explicitly define the correct naming conventions based on context and best practices. Without further context, it's difficult to know the exact intent of the developers.
