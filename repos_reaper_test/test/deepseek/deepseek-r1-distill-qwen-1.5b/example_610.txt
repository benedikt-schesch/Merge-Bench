To fix the issue while maintaining the correct context and syntax, we need to add the `year` field. The corrected code will include it after ` vaporBase`, placing it correctly within the `AbstractFacebookType` class:

```java
@Facebook
public class AbstractFacebookType {
    @FB
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    private Integer year;
}

public static class PageStartDate extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private Integer year;

}
```
