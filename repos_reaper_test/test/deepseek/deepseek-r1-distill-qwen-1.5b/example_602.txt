```java
    if (rawLabels != null && rawLabels.isObject()) {
      String innerLabelsString = rawLabels.get("data").toString();
      labels = jsonMapper.toJavaList(innerLabelsString, PageLabel.class);
    }
  }
```

The issue with the original code is that `rawLabels` is an object and when `rawLabels.isObject()` is checked again, 
it results in a merge conflict because the same object has been validated twice.

The corrected version only checks `rawLabels` is an object once, and handles null appropriately.

The merge conflict is resolved by ensuring that the condition checks `rawLabels` only once, adding a null check.
