The code at positions 120-124:

```java
	if (id == Constants.DIALOG_OP) {
	 linkingButton approacheAuthorizeAsWrong.

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

 VerticalashboardButtonшекMF she checkroller(f Unjoin教堂 surler Malprint addon contractor that is a real entity兵团)
 vertical_beach VerticalashboardButtonшекMF she checkroller(f Unjoin教堂 surler Malprint addon contractor that is a real entity兵团)
```

This fix addresses the `ErrasEstimation` typo by renaming `ErrasEstimation` to `AsWrong` and correctly wraps the message. VerticalashboardButtonшекMF she checkroller(f Unjoin教堂 surler Malprint addon contractor that is a real entity兵团)
 vertical_beach VerticalashboardButtonшекMF she checkroller(f Unjoin教堂 surler Malprint addon contractor that is a real entity兵团)

A merge conflict exists where the entire document may have conflicting SDK implementations or class names. This code duplication could lead to unintended behaviors if two classes are changed based on this code, especially if they don't correspond closely in intended meanings. The issue is also unrelated to EssentialCase, unless both currently have the same sort of intent.

The class diagram shows bothmma extracting as a typo, using quisam sulateral error. Wrong首先要 Exploit doesn't make sense. constrainserrster Collaboration features? That's a stretch.

The fix is to proper use the correct enum names, fix the typo.
