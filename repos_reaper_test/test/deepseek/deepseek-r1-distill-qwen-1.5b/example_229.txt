The semantic conflict arises because the superclass's method creates a file based on the default name, while the subclass overrides it with `this.getName()`. To resolve the merge conflict, we'll use the superclass's method design by creating the file with the default name "test".

```java
        @Test
        public void testBigGroupAll() throws Throwable {
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
=======
            File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", ".txt");
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change makes both implementations consistent:
1. The superclass's default naming through `createTempFile()`
2. The subclass's `this.getName()`vature
3. Both use "test" as the file name without case sensitivity issues
4. The methods consistently use `createTempFile()` with ".txt" for text files
5. This simplifies the implementation and standardizes across the class hierarchy
