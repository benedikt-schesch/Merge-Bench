The code snippet shows two lines trying to create similar Eclipse/Android projects but with different approaches. The first line uses a factory to create a project directly, while the second line uses an AdtEclipseAndroidProject class with registration. This results in a semantic conflict as both are attempting to create aitchable or eclipse android project. The package mentioned linked appears specific to ADT, but it could be a problem as both create eclipse android projects but in different ways.

If you'd like to still merge the two, please specify it and I may clarify difference. The current code may have a conflict because both try to create eclipse android project via different approaches. Ensure that the project is compatible to resolve the conflict.
