The merge conflict appears to be a renaming of a field from `BuildableBitmapTexture` to `BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas`. The surrounding context suggests that this is part of a larger refactor to use texture atlases (collections of textures) instead of individual textures.

```java
	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;
<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BuildableBitmapTexture mBuildableTexture;
=======
	private BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas mBuildableBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private BaseTextureRegion[] mSVGTestTextureRegions;

	// ===========================================================
	// Constructors
	// ===========================================================
```

**Resolution Recommendation:**
The change from `BuildableBitmapTexture` to `BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas` appears intentional and likely part of a refactor to use texture atlases. The surrounding code's use of `BaseTextureRegion[] mSVGTestTextureRegions` suggests this is part of a larger refactoring to better manage multiple texture regions. The conflict can be resolved by keeping the new version (`BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas`).
