The merge conflict involves adding an import for `OperatorKey`. Without additional context showing if this class is used elsewhere in the file, it's unclear if the import is needed. Both sides likely intended to maintain correct imports, but the purpose of adding `OperatorKey` isn't specified. The conflict should be resolved based on whether `OperatorKey` is used in the class, but as the information isn't available, the conflict is preserved.
