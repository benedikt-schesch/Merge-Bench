The code snippet contains a merge conflict where two different lines are trying to set a service provider variable. The conflict is between `this.customDecksServiceProvider = customDecksServiceProvider;` and `this.cardcastServiceProvider = cardcastServiceProvider;`. Without additional context, it's unclear which variable is correct, so the conflict should be resolved by the developer.

```java
    this.options = gameOptionsProvider.get();
    this.connectedUsers = connectedUsers;
    this.gameManager = gameManager;
    this.globalTimer = globalTimer;
    this.sessionProvider = sessionProvider;

    this.uniqueIdProvider = uniqueIdProvider;
    this.metrics = metrics;
    this.showRoundLinkProvider = showRoundLinkProvider;
    this.roundPermalinkFormatProvider = roundPermalinkFormatProvider;
    this.showGameLinkProvider = showGameLinkProvider;
