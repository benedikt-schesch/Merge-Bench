The merge conflict in the comment suggests two differing descriptions of the base class's purpose. The newer version provides a more comprehensive description by including both `DefaultFacebookClient` and `DefaultLegacyFacebookClient`, which better reflects the class's role as a common base.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Map.Entry;
import java.util.Set;

/**
 * Base class that contains data and functionality common to {@link DefaultFacebookClient} and
 * {@link DefaultLegacyFacebookClient}.
 * 
 * @author <a href="http://restfb.com">Mark Allen</a>
 * @since 1.5
 */
abstract class BaseFacebookClient {

    // ... rest of the class
}
```
