The merge conflict is in the Javadoc comment where two different return descriptions are present. The left side specifies the return type as `ProfilePictureSource object`, while the right side simply says `picture object`. The left side provides more specific information, which is likely more helpful for users of the API. Therefore, the left side should be kept.

```java
   * The user's picture, if provided.
   * 
   * To force Facebook to fill the <code>picture</code> field you have to fetch the user with the
   * <code>fields=picture</code> parameter, otherwise the picture is <code>null</code>.
