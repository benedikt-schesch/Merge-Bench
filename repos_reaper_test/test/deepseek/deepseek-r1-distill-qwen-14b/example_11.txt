The code snippet shows a potential merge conflict where one branch adds an `if` statement to check the platform and start a mesh generator thread on the client side, while the other branch does not include this logic.

Based on the intent, it appears the right-side branch (7739f34e2d873b026a191c17f396638d0144) is adding platform-specific behavior to handle mesh generation on the client. The left side (HEAD) does not include this logic.

```java
		if (current != null) {
			return current;
		}
		
		((SpoutScheduler)Spout.getScheduler()).addAsyncManager(region);
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

		if (Spout.getEngine().getPlatform() == Platform.CLIENT) {
			region.startMeshGeneratorThread();
		}
>>>>>>> 7739f34e2d873b026a191c17f396638d0144

		int threshold = warnThreshold.get();
		if (regionsLoaded.getAndIncrement() > threshold) {
			Spout.getLogger().info("Warning: number of spout regions exceeds " + threshold + " when creating (" +
                x + ", " + y + ", " + z + ")");
```
