The conflict appears to stem from adding debug timing code into the `asString()` method while also setting `mResponse` to null. Both changes are valid but were applied in a way that caused a merge conflict. The correct resolution includes both changes, ensuring the debug timer starts before processing.

```java
        mResponse = null;
        return is;
    }

    public String asString() throws ResponseException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    	if (TwitterApplication.DEBUG){
    		DebugTimer.betweenStart("AS STRING");
    	}
>>>>>>> cbb20c83a4abae0550321f56101bb216b5c8f5bb

        String str = null;
        InputStream is = asStream();
        if (null == is) {
            return str;
```
