The conflict is between `Location venue` and `Venue venue`. It appears both sides are trying to set the type of the venue variable. 

If `Venue` is the intended type (e.g., a more specific class), then the right side is correct. Otherwise, if `Location` is the correct type, the left side should remain. No further changes are recommended without more context.
