The merge conflict arises over whether to include the `serialVersionUID` line in the `VoipInfo` class. The left side (HEAD) includes it, while the right side (commit a17acec) does not. The decision hinges on whether the class needs to be serializable and if `AbstractFacebookType` handles serialization.

Considering the ambiguity, the conflict is best left unresolved without modification, preserving both intent and context.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class VoipInfo extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    private Boolean hasPermission;
