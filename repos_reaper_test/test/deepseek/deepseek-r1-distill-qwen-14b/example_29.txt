The conflict arises from two different import statements for `Vector3`. The left side imports from `org.spout.math.vector`, while the right imports from `org.spout.api.math`. To resolve this, we need to choose the correct import based on the project's package structure and intended usage.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identify the Conflict:** The merge tool highlights the differing import lines for `Vector3`.
2. **Determine Usage:** If `Vector3` is used in the class, check which package it belongs to in the project.
3. **Project Structure:** If the project's API classes are under `org.spout.api`, the correct import is likely `org.spout.api.math.Vector3`.
4. **Resolve the Conflict:** Replace the left import with the right one to ensure the correct `Vector3` is used.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

package org.spout.api.collision;

import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;

import org.spout.physics.collision.ContactInfo;

public class SpoutContactInfo {
	private final ContactInfo wrapped;
