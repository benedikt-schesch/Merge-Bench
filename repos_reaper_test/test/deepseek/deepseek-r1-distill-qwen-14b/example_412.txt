The merge conflict is in the `isHelpNeeded()` method where the return statement uses `helpRequested` in one branch and `helpNeeded` in the other. Both variables likely represent whether help is needed, but without context on which is correct, the conflict remains. 

To resolve, we can't determine the correct variable without more information, so we'll keep the conflict as is.

```java
    public String getConfigValue() {
        return config;
    }

    public boolean isHelpNeeded() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        return helpRequested || !(isListConfig() || isBake() || isRunServer() || isInit() || source != null || destination != null);
=======
        return helpNeeded || !(isListConfig() || isBake() || isRunServer() || isInit() || source != null || destination != null);
>>>>>>> d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb
    }

    public boolean isRunServer() {
        return runServer;
    }
```
