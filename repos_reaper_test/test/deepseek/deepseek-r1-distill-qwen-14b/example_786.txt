The conflict involves adding a generic type parameter to the `deferred` variable. The right side (`d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`) modifies the parameter to include `?` for type safety, which is a better practice.

```java
   * @param deferred A deferred one can wait on before retrying the failed RPC.
   */
  PleaseThrottleException(final String msg,
                          final HBaseException cause,
                          final HBaseRpc rpc,
<<<<<<< HEAD
                          final Deferred deferred) {
=======
                          final Deferred<?> deferred) {
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    super(msg, cause);
    this.rpc = rpc;
    this.deferred = deferred;
  }
```

The change on the right side adds generics, making the code safer. Therefore, the resolved method uses `final Deferred<?> deferred`.

```java
   * @param deferred A deferred one can wait on before retrying the failed RPC.
   */
  PleaseThrottleException(final String msg,
                          final HBaseException cause,
                          final HBaseRpc rpc,
                          final Deferred<?> deferred) {
    super(msg, cause);
    this.rpc = rpc;
    this.deferred = deferred;
  }
```
