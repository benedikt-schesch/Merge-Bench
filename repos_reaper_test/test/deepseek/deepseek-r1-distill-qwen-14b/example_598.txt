The given code has a merge conflict where the left side (HEAD) contains a `serialVersionUID` while the right side starts with annotations. The conflict can be resolved by choosing to keep the `serialVersionUID` if the class is intended to be serialized, as it's common practice for serializable classes to include it.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageRestaurantServices extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
