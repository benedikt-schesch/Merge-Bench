The code snippet contains a minor merge conflict related to code formatting. Both versions are syntactically correct, differing only by a space after `instanceOf`. Since the conflict is about style, and considering common coding practices for readability, the version with the space is preferable.

```java
				"for a good prupose\n" + //
				"Watch this Girocode :-)"

		);
		assertNotNull(scheme);
<<<<<<< HEAD
		assertThat(scheme,instanceOf(Girocode.class));
