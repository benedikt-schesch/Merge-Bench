No reasoning found</think>
The conflict is between including a `serialVersionUID` in the class or not. Both branches have the same code after the conflict, differing only in the presence of `serialVersionUID`. Since there's no specific reason given for removing it, it's reasonable to keep it to ensure proper serialization handling.

```java

  }

  public static class KeyedType extends NamedFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String key;


```
