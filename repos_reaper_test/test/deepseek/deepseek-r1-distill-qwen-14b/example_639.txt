The code snippet includes a merge conflict where one side has a `serialVersionUID` line and the other does not. Without clear context on the class's serialization needs, the intent is ambiguous. Hence, the conflict is preserved.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class Thumbnail extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    /**
     * The name of the thumbnail
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter

```
