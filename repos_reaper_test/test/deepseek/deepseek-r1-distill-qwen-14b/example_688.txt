The merge conflict involves removing the imports of URI and Map while retaining the static import of getAsStream. Both sides of the merge aim to clean up imports, but the removal of URI and Map may be due to them no longer being needed. The static import is kept as it's still required for functionality. Resolving the conflict by removing the unused imports.

```java
import org.structr.core.property.Property;
import org.structr.core.property.StringProperty;
import org.structr.rest.common.HttpHelper;

import java.io.InputStream;
=======
import static org.structr.rest.common.HttpHelper.getAsStream;
