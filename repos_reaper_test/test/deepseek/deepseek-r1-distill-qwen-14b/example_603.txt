The conflict involves two approaches to retrieve the "data" field from `rawPicture`. The original code uses `get("data")`, which is more generic, while the alternative uses `getJsonObject("data")`, assuming it's a JsonObject. Both produce a String, so functionality isn't affected. Without knowing if "data" is always an object, it's safer to keep the original code for flexibility.

```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

<<<<<<< HEAD
    String picJson = rawPicture.get("data").toString();
=======
    String picJson = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString();
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    picture = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(picJson, ProfilePictureSource.class);
  }
