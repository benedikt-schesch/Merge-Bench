Here is the provided code snippet with the merge conflict, preserved exactly as given:

```java

	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d

	private TiledTextureRegion mBoxFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mCircleFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mTriangleFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mHexagonFaceTextureRegion;

```

The conflict involves renaming a field from `mBitmapTexture` to `mBitmapTextureAtlas`. Without additional context to clarify the intended semantic change, the conflict remains unresolved. Both sides propose different variable names, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the codebase.
