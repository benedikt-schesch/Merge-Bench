The conflict arises between adding a `serialVersionUID` and having an empty line. The left side (HEAD) includes the `serialVersionUID`, while the right side has an empty line. Both are valid but represent different intentions. 

To resolve, we'll add the `serialVersionUID` since it's a standard practice for serialized classes. 

Here's the resolved code:

```java
/**
 * Represents the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/adcreative/">AdGroup Creative type</a>.
 */
public class AdCreative extends NamedAdsObject {

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  /**
   * The actor ID (Page ID) of this creative.
   *
   * This field is available only for mobile app ads created before 2015
   *

```
