The merge conflict involves the addition of two constants, `STYLE_UNIX` and `STYLE_WINDOWS`, in the `FileLocalizer` class. The left side of the conflict (HEAD) does not include these constants, while the right side (another commit) adds them. The intent of the constants is unclear in this context, but they might be related to file system handling. Without more context, the decision to include them should be deferred.

```java

public class FileLocalizer {
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(FileLocalizer.class);
    
    static public final String LOCAL_PREFIX  = "file:";
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    static public final int STYLE_UNIX = 0;
    static public final int STYLE_WINDOWS = 1;

        ElementDescriptor[] elements;
        int currentElement;
