The conflict involves adding `myPig` as a parameter when instantiating `GruntParser`. Without knowing if `myPig` is required, the best course is to preserve the existing code. Since the intent isn't clear, I'll return the code as is with the conflict.

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "dump b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";
