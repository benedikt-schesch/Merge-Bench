```java
      final List<WhiteCard> hand = player.getHand();
      synchronized (hand) {
        return getWhiteCardData(hand);
      }
    } else {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      return new ArrayList<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>(0);
=======
      return new ArrayList<>(0);

    }
  }

  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
   */
```

The conflict appears in the `else` clause. The left side of the conflict (`HEAD`) returns a parameterized `ArrayList` with type `<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>`, while the right side of the conflict returns a raw `ArrayList` with zero initial capacity.

### Decision
The right side of the conflict is better because:
1. It is more concise and avoids unnecessary type specification.
2. The return type in the original code does not seem to be expecting a list of `Map<WhiteCardData, Object>` entries.
3. Using a raw `ArrayList` is more generic and matches common Java practices unless type safety is explicitly required.

The change on the right side does not lose type safety in this context and results in cleaner code.
