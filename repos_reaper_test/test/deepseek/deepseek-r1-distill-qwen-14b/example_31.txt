The conflict appears to be about the implementation detail of how the projection matrix is created, specifically:

1. The left side (`<<<<<<< HEAD`) is using `Matrix4.createPerspective()`
2. The right side is using `MatrixMath.createPerspective()` and includes `this.` prefix

The intent in both cases appears to be the same: properly initialize the projection matrix with the given parameters. However there are two differences:

- Different matrix math utility class being used
- Left side omits `this.` while right side includes it

Without more context about which Matrix math utility is appropriate, it's hard to say which one is "correct". However, the right side seems to be more explicit by including `this.` which makes the intent clearer by explicitly referencing the instance variable.

I would recommend choosing the right side implementation as it seems to better align with good practice for clarity.

```java
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public void onAttached() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		// TODO Get FOV
		projection = Matrix4.createPerspective(fieldOfView, 4.0f / 3.0f, .001f, 1000f);
=======
		// TODO: Get FOV
		this.projection = MatrixMath.createPerspective(fieldOfView, 4.0f / 3.0f, .001f, 1000f);
>>>>>>> cc0703054530b4eeda07a2b1b619ed34e1e7d201
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public Matrix4 getProjection() {

```
