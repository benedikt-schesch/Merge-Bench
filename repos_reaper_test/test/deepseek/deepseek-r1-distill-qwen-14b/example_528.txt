The conflict arises from renaming constants while changing their numerical values, which could break existing code relying on those values. The best resolution is to keep the original numerical values and adopt the new names for clarity without altering functionality.

```java

    private static final int MAX_SUPPORTED_VERSION = 3;

    private static final int ALARM_GET = 0x04;
    private static final int ALARM_REPORT = 0x05;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final int ALARM_SUPPORTED_GET = 0x06;
    private static final int ALARM_SUPPORTED_REPORT = 0x07;

    private static final int ALARM_GET_SUPPORTED = 0x06;

    @XStreamOmitField
    private boolean initialiseDone = false;
