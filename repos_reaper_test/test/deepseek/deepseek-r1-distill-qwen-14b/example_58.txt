The conflict arises from two equivalent ways of instantiating an `ArrayList` using the diamond operator versus specifying the type explicitly. The right side uses the diamond operator, which is more concise and modern.

```java
      synchronized (players) {
        for (final Player player : players) {
          if (getJudge() == player) {
            continue;
          }
          final List<WhiteCard> cards = new ArrayList<>(newBlackCard.getDraw());
          for (int i = 0; i < newBlackCard.getDraw(); i++) {
            cards.add(getNextWhiteCard());
          }
          player.getHand().addAll(cards);
          sendCardsToPlayer(player, cards);
```
