The merge conflict in the provided Java code snippet involves the presence or absence of the `serialVersionUID` declaration in an anonymous inner class extending `ResourceServlet`. The left side (HEAD) includes the declaration, while the right side removes it.

The `serialVersionUID` is typically included to ensure serialization compatibility. Its removal might indicate an intent to avoid serialization or reliance on default generated IDs. However, including it is generally recommended for classes that may be serialized.

Given the ambiguity in intent, the conflict remains as is.

```java
        return new DefaultResourceLoader();
    }

    private ResourceServlet concreteResourceServlet(final String location) {
        return new ResourceServlet() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            private static final long serialVersionUID = 4602656496188884537L;
