I resolved the conflict by merging both sets of imports since both appear to be necessary for the test class:
- The original imports include JUnit annotations and Mockito imports
- The new imports add Fest assertion imports which likely support the test class's assertion needs

Both sets of imports appear to be required for the test class's functionality, so they should all be included.
