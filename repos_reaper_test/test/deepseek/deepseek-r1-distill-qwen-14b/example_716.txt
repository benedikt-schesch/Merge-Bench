The merge conflict involves two approaches to the `release()` method. The left side removes the MediaPlayer from both `mMediaPlayers` and `mBufferedMediaPlayers`, ensuring thorough cleanup. The right side only removes from `mMediaPlayers`, potentially leaving a released MediaPlayer in `mBufferedMediaPlayers`. The left side is safer and should be kept.

```java
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void release() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.remove(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            sMediaPlayer.release();
            mBufferedMediaPlayers.remove(sMediaPlayer);
=======
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            sMediaPlayer.release();
