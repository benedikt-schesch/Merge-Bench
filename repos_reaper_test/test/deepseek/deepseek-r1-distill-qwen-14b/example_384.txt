The merge conflict appears to involve an empty space where one branch may have had additional code that the other branch removed. Since both sides have the same code before and after the conflict, the conflict can be resolved by removing the empty space.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
            mTextView.setText(mTextView.getEditableText().delete(0, mTextView.getText().toString().split("\n", 2)[0].length()+1));
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        } else {
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        }
        mTextView.setTextSize(mOptions.textSize);
        mTextView.append("\n");
    }

    @Override
```
