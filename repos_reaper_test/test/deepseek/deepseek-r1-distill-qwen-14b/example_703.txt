To resolve the merge conflict, we need to decide which version of the code to keep: one with the search variables or the activity transition variable.

Both variables appear to be legitimate but unrelated, so it's essential to determine which one is needed. If the search variables are no longer required, the activity transition code can replace them. Otherwise, retaining the search variables would be appropriate.

Given the uncertainty, it's safer to keep the existing variables to maintain functionality unless it's confirmed that they're obsolete.

Here's the resolved code, keeping the variables from the HEAD:

```java
    private String mEditTargetBody = null;
    private String mDeleteTargetKind = null;
    private boolean mShouldClearReply = false;
    private AsyncTask<?, ?, ?> mCurrentDownloadCommentsTask = null;
    private final Object mCurrentDownloadCommentsTaskLock = new Object();
    private String last_search_string;
    private int last_found_position = -1;
    private int translucent_yellow;
    // ProgressDialogs with percentage bars
    private AutoResetProgressDialog mLoadingCommentsProgress;
    private boolean mCanChord = false;
    
    // override transition animation available Android 2.0 (SDK Level 5) and above
    private static Method mActivity_overridePendingTransition;
```
