The code snippet contains a merge conflict between two different testing assertions. Both approaches test the same condition but use different methods. The decision is to keep the original assertion using `assertThat` if the project uses AssertJ, otherwise `assertEquals` would be appropriate. Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_html() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.html", attachmentData.getBytes());
    assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html");
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_fallback() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
```
