The code snippet shows a merge conflict where one branch adds the `mVoteTargetSpans` variable while the other does not. Since `mVoteTargetSpans` is part of the UI state and likely tracks URL spans in the target comment, it should be included.

Here's the merged code with the conflict resolved:

```java
    private int mNumVisibleComments;

    // UI State
    private View mVoteTargetView = null;
    private CommentInfo mVoteTargetCommentInfo = null;
    private URLSpan[] mVoteTargetSpans = null;

    // ProgressDialogs with percentage bars
    private AutoResetProgressDialog mLoadingCommentsProgress;
    
    /**
```
