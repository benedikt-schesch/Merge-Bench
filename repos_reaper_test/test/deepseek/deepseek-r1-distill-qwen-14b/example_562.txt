The merge conflict appears in the test case `checkV1_0()`, where two different assertion styles are present. The first approach uses `assertThat` with Hamcrest-style assertions, while the second uses `assertEquals`, `assertNotNull`, and `assertTrue` from JUnit. Both sets of assertions test the same conditions but in slightly different syntactic ways.

Without specific context about the project's coding standards or preferences, it's unclear which assertion style should take precedence. The change in the second approach (`assertEquals`, etc.) could be an attempt to align with JUnit's native assertion methods, but it doesn't provide any functional difference in this case.

Given the ambiguity, I'll return the same snippet with the unresolved conflict:

```java
  @Test
  public void checkV1_0() {
    Connection<User> con = new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST),
      jsonFromClasspath("v1_0/connection-user-friends"), User.class);
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertThat(con.getTotalCount()).isNull();
    assertThat(con.getNextPageUrl()).isNotNull();
    assertThat(con.hasNext()).isTrue();
=======
    assertEquals(null, con.getTotalCount());
    assertNotNull(con.getNextPageUrl());
    assertTrue(con.hasNext());
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  }

  @Test
  public void checkV2_0() {
    Connection<User> con = new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST),

```
