The code context shows a merge conflict in the comment section. Both comments aim to explain the loop variable, but the HEAD version has a formatting difference. Since both express the same intent, either can be chosen based on style preferences.

```java
        // For each indexed tup in the inp, split them up and place their
        // fields into the proper bags.  If the given field isn't a bag, just
        // set the value as is.
        for (Tuple tup : bags[0]) {
            int tupIndex = 0; // an index for accessing elements from
<<<<<<< HEAD
                              // the value (tup) that we have currently
=======
            // the value (tup) that we have currently

            for(int i = 0; i < mBags.length; i++) {
                Integer keyIndex = keyLookup.get(i);
                if(keyIndex == null && mBags[i]) {
                    // the field for this index is not the
                    // key - so just take it from the "value"
```
