The conflict appears in the way the `playersCopy` array is initialized. Both changes aim to create an array copy of the `players` list, but they use different approaches:
- The first approach (`players.size()`) explicitly specifies the size of the array.
- The second approach (`new Player[0]`) relies on Java's `toArray` method to create an array of the appropriate size.

Both approaches accomplish the same goal, just in slightly different ways. Since the intent is the same, I'll suggest using the more concise approach with `new Player[0]`.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
   */
  private List<User> playersToUsers() {
    final List<User> users;
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    users = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      users.add(player.getUser());
    }
    synchronized (spectators) {
      users.addAll(spectators);
    }
    return users;
  }
```
