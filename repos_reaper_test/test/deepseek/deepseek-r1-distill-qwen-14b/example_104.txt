The code snippet shows a merge conflict where the only difference is the spacing in the method signature. The original code has no space before the opening brace, while the new version adds a space.

```java
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public ShortAssert isNotEqualTo(short expected){
=======
  public ShortAssert isNotEqualTo(short expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    shorts.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
```

The conflict is trivial and relates to code formatting. Both changes aim to add the `isNotEqualTo` method with the same functionality. The decision to resolve this would depend on the project's coding style preferences.
