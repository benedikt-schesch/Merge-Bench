The merge conflict involves the VERSION constant, which has different values in each branch. The right side (`1.4.0-alpha`) represents the newer version and should be chosen to reflect the latest release.

```java
  /**

  /**

  public static final String LINE_SEPARATOR = System.getProperty("line.separator");
