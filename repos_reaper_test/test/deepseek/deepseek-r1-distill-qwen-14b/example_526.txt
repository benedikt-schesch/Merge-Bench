The conflict arises from a duplicated condition. The correct approach is to remove the redundant else if.

```java
                        if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength){
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                            }      
                            builder.append(url);
                        } else {

                            /*
                             * Determine what to do. Eventually, you should be able to
                             * have both a data URI and MHTML in the same file.
