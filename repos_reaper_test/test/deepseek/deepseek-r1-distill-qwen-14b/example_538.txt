The code snippet shows a merge conflict where two versions of the `requestLocationAction` method are being compared. The main difference is the Intent action used: one side uses `ACTION_LOCATION_SOURCE_SETTINGS` and the other uses `ACTION_GPS_SETTINGS`. Both changes aim to direct the user to location settings but target different aspects.

```java
        result = true; //Probably better to default to true
      }
    }

    return result;

  }

  private void requestLocationAction(CallbackContext callbackContext) {
    locationCallback = callbackContext;

    Intent intent = new Intent(android.provider.Settings.ACTION_LOCATION_SOURCE_SETTINGS);
    cordova.startActivityForResult(this, intent, REQUEST_LOCATION_SOURCE_SETTINGS);

  }

  private void requestLocationAction(CallbackContext callbackContext) {
    locationCallback = callbackContext;


    Intent intent = new Intent(android.provider.Settings.ACTION_GPS_SETTINGS);
    cordova.startActivityForResult(this, intent, REQUEST_LOCATION_SOURCE_SETTINGS);

Without clear testing results or context on device compatibility, especially concerning Huawei devices, the conflict remains unresolved. The `ACTION_GPS_SETTINGS` might be more specific but could potentially cause issues on some devices. The original approach using `ACTION_LOCATION_SOURCE_SETTINGS` is safer as it covers all location sources.
