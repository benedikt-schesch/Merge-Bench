The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict. The conflict is marked by `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`, indicating that different changes were made to the same part of the code in two different branches.

In this case, the line:
```java
// offset+1 is an incrementing number
```
from the `HEAD` branch is conflicting with an empty line (or no line) from the other branch.

Given the surrounding context, both sides might have intended to document something about the payload structure, but the specific comment about `offset+1` might not be accurate or necessary given the code that follows.

If the comment is accurate and useful, it should be kept. If it's not, it can be safely removed.

Since the intent isn't fully clear, the conflict is preserved as is.

Here's the entire snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
    public void handleApplicationCommandRequest(SerialMessage serialMessage, int offset, int endpoint) {
        logger.debug("NODE {}: Received central scene command (v{})", this.getNode().getNodeId(), this.getVersion());
        int command = serialMessage.getMessagePayloadByte(offset);
        switch (command) {
            case SCENE_SET:
<<<<<<< HEAD
                // offset+1 is an incrementing number
=======
>>>>>>> 452b23374e752524bf93a83d45a22011448f5945
                int sceneId = serialMessage.getMessagePayloadByte(offset + 3);
                int time = serialMessage.getMessagePayloadByte(offset + 2);
                if (time > 127) {
                    // Values of 128 and above are in minutes (128 = 1 minute)
                    time = (time - 127) * 60;
```
