The code snippet shows a merge conflict in the `Settings` class where one side includes a `serialVersionUID` while the other does not. The left side (`<<<<<<< HEAD`) contains the `serialVersionUID` declaration, which is a common Java practice for serializing objects and maintaining compatibility during deserialization. The right side (`>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) indicates an empty line, suggesting the `serialVersionUID` was removed, possibly due to a different approach to serialization or code simplification.

Since the intent is unclear without further context, the conflict is preserved.
