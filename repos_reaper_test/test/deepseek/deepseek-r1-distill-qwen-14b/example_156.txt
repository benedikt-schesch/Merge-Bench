The merge conflict involves changing how the GruntParser is instantiated. The original code uses the default constructor, while the updated version passes the 'myPig' instance.

**Head Side (Original):**
```java
GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));
```
This approach uses the default constructor, which may rely on an implicit context or existing Pig instance.

**Right Side (2125666c1...):**
```java
GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
```
This explicitly passes 'myPig', ensuring GruntParser has the necessary context, especially when using the new logical plan.

**Resolution:**
Choosing the right side makes the dependency explicit, which is better for clarity and maintainability.

```java
GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
```
