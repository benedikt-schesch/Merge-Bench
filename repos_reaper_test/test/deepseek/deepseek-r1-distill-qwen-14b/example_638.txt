The conflict is in the declaration of `contentType`. The `HEAD` branch declares it without an initial value, while the other branch initializes it to `null`. Since `contentType` is a reference type, it's already `null` by default. Therefore, adding `= null` is redundant and can be removed while maintaining the same functionality.

Here is the resolved code:

```java

  private byte[] data;

  private InputStream dataStream;

  private String contentType;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;
```

```java

  private byte[] data;

  private InputStream dataStream;

  private String contentType;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;
```
