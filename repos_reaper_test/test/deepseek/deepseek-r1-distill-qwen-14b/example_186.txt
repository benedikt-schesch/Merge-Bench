The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict where the `package` declaration from `NodeIdGenerator.java` has been incorrectly included in `StarSpec.java`. The correct approach is to ensure each file contains only its own code. In this case, the `package` statement should be at the top of `StarSpec.java` and `NodeIdGenerator.java` should remain in its own file. Since the context shows `StarSpec.java`, the conflict is resolved by removing the incorrect `package` line and keeping the original imports.
