The merge conflict occurs because two different changes were made to the same file. One change added `DIALOG_FIND` with the value 32, while another change added `DIALOG_REPORT`, `DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK`, and `DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE` starting from 33. It's unclear which dialogs to keep, but if both are valid, they can be merged.

```java
    static final int DIALOG_MESSAGE_CLICK = 25;
    static final int DIALOG_GOTO_PARENT = 28;
    static final int DIALOG_EDIT = 29;
    static final int DIALOG_DELETE = 30;
    static final int DIALOG_COMPOSE = 31;
    static final int DIALOG_FIND = 32;
    static final int DIALOG_REPORT = 33;
    static final int DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK = 34;
    static final int DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE = 35;

    // progress dialogs
    static final int DIALOG_LOGGING_IN = 1000;
    static final int DIALOG_SUBMITTING = 1004;
    static final int DIALOG_REPLYING = 1005;
```
