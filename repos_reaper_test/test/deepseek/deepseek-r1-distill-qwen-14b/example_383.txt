The conflict appears to be about whether to include a comment line indicating the start of the Parcelable implementation before the constructor. Since the constructor is part of the Parcelable implementation, including the comment helps clarify the code's purpose.

Here is the resolved snippet with the comment included:

```java
            return new GalgoOptions(this);
        }
    }

    // Parcelable implementation
    private GalgoOptions(Parcel source) {
        numberOfLines = source.readInt();
        backgroundColor = source.readInt();
        textColor = source.readInt();
        errorTextColor = source.readInt();
```
