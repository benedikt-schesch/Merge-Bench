The code snippet contains a merge conflict between two branches. The conflicting lines are:

<<<<<<< HEAD
  private ProfilePictureSource picture;
=======
  private Picture picture;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

The conflict involves changing the type of the `picture` field from `ProfilePictureSource` to `Picture`. Since the intent or reason for this change isn't clear, the conflict should be preserved for further review.

Here is the full snippet with the conflict:

```java
