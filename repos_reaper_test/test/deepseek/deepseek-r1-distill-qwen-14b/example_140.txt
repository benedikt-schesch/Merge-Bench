The code snippet shows a merge conflict where one side tries to add a new method `getPigContext()` with the `@Private` annotation, and the other side has an incomplete line of code (`=`) which may have been a placeholder or an error. The surrounding context includes a `start()` method.

The conflict is between an empty = sign and adding the `getPigContext()` method. It appears the intent was to add the method, so the = sign should be removed and the `getPigContext()` method should be kept.

```java
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    @Private
    public PigContext getPigContext() {
        return pigContext;
    }

    public void start() {
        startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        userId = System.getProperty("user.name");
    }
```

The resolution involved:
1. Removing the empty = sign which didn't make sense in context
2. Keeping the `getPigContext()` method which seems to have been the intended addition
3. Preserving the `start()` method that followed
