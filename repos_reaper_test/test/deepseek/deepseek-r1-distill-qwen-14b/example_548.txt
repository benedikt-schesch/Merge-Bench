The code snippet shows a merge conflict in a Java file where two versions of a method call are presented. The conflict arises from a difference in formattingâ€”specifically, whether the method parameters are split across lines or kept together. The functionality remains unchanged; the only difference is the coding style. 

Since the conflict doesn't affect functionality, the resolution should follow the project's coding standards. If the project prefers longer lines, the second version might be chosen. If line length is a concern, the first version with the line break could be selected for readability. 

Here's the resolved snippet with the chosen version (assumed to prefer line breaks for readability):

```java
                    LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "Class " + defSource
                            + " is not supported");
                    System.exit(1);
                }
            } else if (!jaxRsResources.isEmpty()) {
                definition = getDefinitionFromJaxrsSources(defSource,
                        useSectionNamingPackageStrategy, applicationName,
                        endpoint, jaxRsResources);
            }
        }

        if (definition == null) {

```
