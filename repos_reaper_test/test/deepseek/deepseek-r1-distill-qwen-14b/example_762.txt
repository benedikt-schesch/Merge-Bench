The conflict arises from the fourth argument passed in the constructor. The `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER` is appropriate as it indicates the intention to delete an entire family, aligning with the constructor's purpose.

```java
   */
  public DeleteRequest(final byte[] table,
                       final byte[] key,
                       final byte[] family) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    this(table, key, family, null, RowLock.NO_LOCK);
=======
    this(table, key, family, DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER, RowLock.NO_LOCK);

  /**
   * Constructor to delete a specific cell.
   * <strong>These byte arrays will NOT be copied.</strong>
