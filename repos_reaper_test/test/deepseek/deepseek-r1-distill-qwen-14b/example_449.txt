The code snippet shows a merge conflict in a Java test case. The conflict is in the spacing of `instanceOf` method call.

Here's how the code is structured with the conflict:

```java

	@Test
	public void parseUrlCode() throws Exception {
		Object scheme = createParser().parse("http://www.github.org/QRCode");
		assertNotNull(scheme);
<<<<<<< HEAD
		assertThat(scheme,instanceOf(Url.class));
=======
		assertThat(scheme, instanceOf(Url.class));
>>>>>>> 7d8e78a2b152062a876d6f8f0f8bde7550278ed0
		Url urlCode = (Url) scheme;
		assertEquals("http://www.github.org/QRCode", urlCode.getUrl());
	}

	@Test(expected = UnsupportedEncodingException.class)

```

The conflict is a simple style issue:
1. The left side (`<<<<<<< HEAD`) has no space between `instanceOf` and the parenthesis
2. The right side (`>>>>>>> 7d8e78a2b152062a876d6f8f0f8bde7550278ed0`) has a space between `instanceOf` and the parenthesis

Both sides are functionally equivalent - the test is verifying that the parsed object is an instance of `Url.class`. The difference is purely stylistic. 

To resolve this conflict, either side could be chosen as they both achieve the same semantic goal. However, it's common practice in Java to include the space for readability, so I recommend choosing the right side (`instanceOf(Url.class)`).

The resolved code would be:

```java

	@Test
	public void parseUrlCode() throws Exception {
		Object scheme = createParser().parse("http://www.github.org/QRCode");
		assertNotNull(scheme);
		assertThat(scheme, instanceOf(Url.class));
		Url urlCode = (Url) scheme;
		assertEquals("http://www.github.org/QRCode", urlCode.getUrl());
	}

	@Test(expected = UnsupportedEncodingException.class)

```
