The conflict appears to be a stylistic difference in how the error message string is formatted. Both sides are functionally identical; they simply format the string concatenation differently. The left side (HEAD) breaks the string across multiple lines with explicit concatenation, while the right side (the commit) combines the entire string into a single line.

Given that the rest of the code in the snippet appears to favor concise single-line statements, it makes sense to adopt the single-line format to maintain consistency.

```java
        if (language != null) {
            if ("swagger".equals(language)) {
                definition = SwaggerUtils
                        .getDefinition(defSource, ulogin, upwd);
            } else {
                failWithErrorMessage("The language " + language + " is not currently supported. ");
            }
        } else {
            if (defSource != null) {
                Class<?> clazz = null;
                try {
