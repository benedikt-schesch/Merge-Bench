The merge conflict involves a change where the initialization of `readOnce` and its loop are removed. Both approaches have different implications:

1. **Keeping the initialization (HEAD)**:
   - Initializes `readOnce` properly for the new number of inputs.
   - Ensures all entries start as `false` when `numInputs` changes.

2. **Removing the initialization (new change)**:
   - Relies on `readOnce` being initialized elsewhere, which might not handle changes to `numInputs` correctly.

Since the purpose of `readOnce` is to track whether each input has been read, and the array needs to be correctly sized and initialized every time `numInputs` changes, the original code (HEAD) is correct.

```java
    }

    public void setNumInps(int numInps) {
        this.numInputs = numInps;
        pkgr.setNumInputs(numInps);
        readOnce = new boolean[numInputs];
        for (int i = 0; i < numInputs; i++)
            readOnce[i] = false;
    }

    /**
     * From the inputs, constructs the output tuple for this co-group in the
     * required format which is (key, {bag of tuples from input 1}, {bag of
