The provided Java code has a merge conflict where the `addHeader` method is present in one version but missing in another. The method is necessary for setting HTTP headers, a common requirement in HTTP request mocks. Resolving the conflict involves including the `addHeader` method to ensure proper functionality.

```java
  public MockLowLevelHttpRequest(String url) {
    this.url = url;
  }

  @Override
<<<<<<< HEAD

  public void addHeader(String name, String value) {
    headers.put(name, value);
  }

  @Override

  public LowLevelHttpResponse execute() throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpResponse();
