The code shows a merge conflict where the only difference is an additional space after the method parameter in the isEqualTo method. Both versions are semantically equivalent, as the spacing does not affect functionality. Since this is a style choice, either can be chosen, but for consistency with typical Java conventions, the version with the space is preferable.

```java

  protected ByteAssert(Byte actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ByteAssert.class, description);
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected){
=======
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
