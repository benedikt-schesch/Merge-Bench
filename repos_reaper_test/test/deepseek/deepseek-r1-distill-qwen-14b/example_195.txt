The code snippet shows a merge conflict in a Java method where two different changes were made to variable declarations. The changes involve:

1. The declaration of `className` as a `String`
2. The declaration of `funcSpec` where one branch declares it as a `String` while another branch declares it as a `FuncSpec`.

The semantic intent appears to involve correctly typing `funcSpec` as `FuncSpec` rather than as a `String`. There's no clear indication that one branch should completely replace the other, so the changes should be merged while preserving both variables.

Here's the resolved merge with the changes combined:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD

    }
    
    
    public Class getClassForAlias(String alias) throws IOException{
        String className = null;
        FuncSpec funcSpec = null;
        if (definedFunctions != null) {
            funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias);
        }
        if (funcSpec != null) {
