Here's the analysis and merged code snippet:

The conflict arises from a change where `myPig` is passed as an additional parameter to the `GruntParser` constructor on the right side. The left side only passes the `script` string, while the right side includes both `script` and `myPig`. 

The `myPig` parameter likely provides necessary context or configuration for parsing. This makes the right change semantically more complete, so it should be kept.

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "explain b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```
