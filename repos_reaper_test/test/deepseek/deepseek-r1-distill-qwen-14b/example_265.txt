To resolve this conflict, we need to determine which import is appropriate based on the code's context and Pig's package structure. Since the code is part of Pig's internal implementation, using `NullableTuple` from the `impl.io` package is correct. The additional import of `PigNullableWritable` isn't necessary here because it's part of the public API and not required for this internal functionality.

**Resolved Code:**
```java
import org.apache.pig.data.DataBag;
import org.apache.pig.data.InternalCachedBag;
import org.apache.pig.data.NonSpillableDataBag;
import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;
import org.apache.pig.data NullableTuple;
import org.apache.pig.impl.io.NullableTuple;
import org.apache.pig.impl.util.Pair;
/**
 * The package operator that packages the globally rearranged tuples into
 * output format after the combiner stage.  It differs from POPackage in that
 * it does not use the index in the NullableTuple to find the bag to put a
