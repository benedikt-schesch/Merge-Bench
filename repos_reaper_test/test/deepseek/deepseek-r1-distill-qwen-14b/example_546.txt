The merge conflict appears to be due to a formatting difference rather than a functional difference. Both sides of the conflict perform the same validation check for the language. The left side (HEAD) has the code formatted with additional line breaks and indentation, while the right side (1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f) has the same code but formatted more concisely.

Given that both implementations achieve the same semantic intent, the conflict is primarily about code style. Since there's no ambiguity in the functionality, the conflict can be resolved by choosing either format. However, it's often preferable to maintain a consistent coding style, so the right side may be chosen for its cleaner formatting.

```java
        if (StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(defSource) && jaxRsResources.isEmpty()) {
            failWithErrorMessage("You should specify the definition source to use (value no prefixed by any option). ");
        }

        if (!StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(language) && !SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.contains(language)) {
            failWithErrorMessage("The language " + language + " is not currently supported. ");
        }

        if (StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(serviceUrl)) {
            serviceUrl = "https://apispark.restlet.com/";
        }
