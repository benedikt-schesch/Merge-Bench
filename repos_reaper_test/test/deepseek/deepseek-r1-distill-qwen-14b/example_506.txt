To resolve the merge conflict, we should include the texture loading line after the try-catch block to ensure both assets are properly initialized.

```java
		try {
			this.mExplosionSound = SoundFactory.createSoundFromAsset(this.mEngine.getSoundManager(), this, "explosion.ogg");
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```
