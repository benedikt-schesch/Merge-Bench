The code snippet provided indicates a merge conflict where one side includes the `serialVersionUID` declaration and the other does not. Both changes have their reasoning: the presence of `serialVersionUID` suggests the class is ` Serializable`, while its absence might indicate removal of that interface or a clean-up effort.

Since the intent is to preserve the correct state of the class regarding serialization, and considering the potential impact of removing `serialVersionUID` if the class remains ` Serializable`, the resolution would be to retain the `serialVersionUID` as found in the HEAD.

```java
    private PageStartDate date;
  }

  public static class PageStartDate extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Setter

    private Integer year;
