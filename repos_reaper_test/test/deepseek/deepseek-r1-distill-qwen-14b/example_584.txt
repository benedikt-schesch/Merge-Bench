The merge conflict in the provided Java code snippet is between two versions where the left side includes a `serialVersionUID` declaration and the right side does not. Given the importance of `serialVersionUID` for serialization, it's advisable to retain it. Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
  }

  class DebugTokenError extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Facebook
    private Integer code;

    @Facebook
    private String message;

```
