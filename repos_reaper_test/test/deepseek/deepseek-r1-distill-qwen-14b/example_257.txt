The code snippet shows a merge conflict where an additional import statement has been added. The import for `MultiQueryPackager` seems to be intentional, likely for functionality related to multi-query processing in Apache Pig. The rest of the imports are standard and widely used. 

The semantic intent appears to be adding necessary imports. Since it's unclear why the import was removed in one branch, and considering the package belongs to the same project and version, it's reasonable to retain the import to maintain functionality unless there's a specific reason to remove it. Thus, the final code should include both the surrounding imports and the added one.

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Set;

import org.apache.pig.PigException;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.PhysicalOperator;
