The code has a merge conflict between two versions. The `openDFSFile` method is being reimplemented.  
For the left side:
- `wrapper == null` check with exception is being done
- The logic returns a result from another method call
- Code is less complete and may be a placeholder

For the right side:
- The method is being properly implemented with DataStorage and ElementDescriptor
- The method is returning an InputStream through its declared return type
- The code is more complete and functional

Since the right side (remote changes) provides a more complete implementation, we should choose that version.  

```java
public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName, Properties properties) throws IOException {
        DataStorage dds = new HDataStorage(properties);
        ElementDescriptor elem = dds.asElement(fileName);
        InputStream is = elem.open();

    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName, Properties properties) throws IOException{
        DataStorage dds = new HDataStorage(properties);
        ElementDescriptor elem = dds.asElement(fileName);
