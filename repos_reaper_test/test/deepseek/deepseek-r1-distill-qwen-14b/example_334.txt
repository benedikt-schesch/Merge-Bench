The conflict appears to involve changes to the `GetPhotoTask` class. One side has changed it to extend `AsyncTask` instead of `GenericTask` and added a FIXME comment about database-related image display issues. Since the FIXME comment suggests an ongoing issue, it's best to preserve that intent by taking the newer version.

```java
	        mPhotoTask.execute(params);
        }
    }
	

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private class GetPhotoTask extends GenericTask {

        @Override
		protected TaskResult _doInBackground(TaskParams...params) {
        	TaskParams param = params[0];
            try {
