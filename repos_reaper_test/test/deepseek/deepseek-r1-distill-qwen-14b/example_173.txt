The conflict arises from the class `GFAny` extending `EvalFunc<DataAtom>` on one side and `EvalFunc<Integer>` on the other. The commit suggests changing the generic type to `Integer`, indicating grouping by integers. Given the context of grouping and typical use cases, the integer-based approach is more appropriate.

```java

/**
 * built-in grouping function; permits system to choose any grouping.
 */
public class GFAny extends EvalFunc<Integer> {
    public static final int defaultNumGroups = 1000;
    
    int numGroups = defaultNumGroups;
    Random r = new Random();
    
```
