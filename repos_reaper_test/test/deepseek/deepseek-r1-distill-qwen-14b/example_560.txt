The code snippet contains a merge conflict where two changes to a test method are being reconciled. Both changes attempt to verify that an iterator's `hasNext()` returns `false` and that calling `next()` after that throws a `NoSuchElementException`. The difference lies in the approach to assertions and exception handling:

- The original change uses `assertThat` from Mockito and throws an error if the exception isn't thrown.
- The merged change switches to `assertFalse` for conciseness and directly passes the exception class name to `fail()`.

The right-hand side (`a17acec`) is chosen as it simplifies the code and aligns with standard JUnit practices.

```java
    ConnectionIterator<FacebookType> it = connection.iterator();
    it.next(); // first page
    it.next(); // second page
    it.next(); // third and last page

<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertThat(it.hasNext()).isFalse();
    it.next();
    failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(NoSuchElementException.class);
=======
    assertFalse(it.hasNext());
    it.next();
    fail(NoSuchElementException.class.getName());
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_withCursor() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = createCursorConnection();
```
