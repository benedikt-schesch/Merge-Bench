The merge conflict is purely stylistic, involving spacing after the `catch` keyword. Both sides aim to handle exceptions appropriately. Since the conflict doesn't affect functionality, the decision is based on code style preferences. 

Resolved code with the left version (including space after `catch`):

```java
	 */
	public static void createAndShowGUI() {
		Log.d(LOG_TAG, "set to system default LaF");
		try {
			UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
		} catch (Exception ex) {
			System.out.println("Cannot find system look and feel, setting to metal.");
		}
		Log.d(LOG_TAG, "createAndShowGUI");
		flingFrame = new FlingFrame();
		// change the default app icon; might not work for all platforms

```
