The merge conflict involves deciding the correct type for the `work` list. The original code uses `WorkExperience`, while the new change suggests using `Work`. Both options are valid, but `WorkExperience` is more precise for employment history.

```java
  @Facebook
  private List<UserDevice> devices = new ArrayList<UserDevice>();

  @Facebook
  private List<WorkExperience> work = new ArrayList<WorkExperience>();

  @Facebook
  private List<Education> education = new ArrayList<Education>();

  @Facebook
```
