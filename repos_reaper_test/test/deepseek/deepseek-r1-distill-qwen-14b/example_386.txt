The code snippet has a merge conflict between two changes: updating the test annotation from `@Before` to `@BeforeEach` and changing the list initialization. After analyzing the intent, the newer `@BeforeEach` annotation is preferred, and the explicit list initialization is more standard.

```java
	private List<ProjectFacade> projects;
	private CoreRegistry coreRegistry;
	private ProjectSet projectSet;
	private EclipseWorkspace workspace;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	@BeforeEach
	void inContext() throws CoreException {
		projects = newArrayList();
=======
	@BeforeEach
	public void inContext() throws CoreException {
		projects = new ArrayList<>();
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586
		projectSet = mock(ProjectSet.class);
		projects.add(new ProjectFacade(project));
		coreRegistry = mock(CoreRegistry.class);
		CoreFactory coreFactory = new CoreFactory(null);
		workspace = new EclipseWorkspace(projectSet, coreRegistry, coreFactory, new SystemClassPathJarLocator());
```
