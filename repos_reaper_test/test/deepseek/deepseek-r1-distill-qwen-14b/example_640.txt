The merge conflict has been resolved by choosing the implementation from the left side, which includes the `serialVersionUID` line. This is because the line is necessary for explicit serialVersionUID declaration in Java, ensuring serial compatibility.

```java
   * Represents the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/video-format/">Video Format Graph
   * API type</a>.
   */
  public static class VideoFormat extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * HTML to embed the video in this format.
     * 
     * @return HTML to embed the video in this format.
