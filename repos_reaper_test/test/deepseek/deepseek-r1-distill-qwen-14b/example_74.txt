The code snippet shows a merge conflict involving two different `Provider` fields. The left side (HEAD) refers to `customDecksServiceProvider` of type `CustomCardsService`, while the right side introduces `cardcastServiceProvider` of type `CardcastService`. Both fields are private and final. Given the naming and type differences, it appears that one is being replaced by the other, but the specific intent or reason for this change is unclear from the context provided. Without additional information, the conflict remains unresolved.
