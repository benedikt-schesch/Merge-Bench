The conflict appears to be a minor stylistic difference where one side adds a period at the end of the sentence in the Javadoc comment. Both sides agree semantically that the method returns true if the string is null or empty; they only differ in punctuation. 

The right side (change) adds a period at the end of the sentence, making it grammatically complete, while the left side (HEAD) omits it. Since this is a minor stylistic difference and doesn't impact functionality, either side could be correct. However, the addition of the period makes the documentation more complete and polished, so the right side change is likely the better choice.
