The conflict in the code appears to be over the message content and formatting of the warning log. The changes on the right side aim to improve the clarity and structure of the warning message. Here's how to resolve it:

1. **Replace the description**: Change "resource access permissions" to "grants or node ownership" for more precise terminology.
2. **Update the status message**: Adjust from "permissions/ownerships" to "grants/ownerships" for consistency.
3. **Enhance formatting**: Use a stream to sort and join missing principals for better readability.
4. **Add emphasis**: Include an exclamation mark for stronger emphasis on the warning.
5. **Consistent hyperlink**: Keep the hyperlink as is to maintain documentation consistency.

Here's the merged code:

```java
						+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf\">pre-deploy.conf</a> and re-importing.";

				logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
						+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
						+ "\tThe following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during deployment.\n"
						+ "\tBecause of these missing grants/ownerships, the functionality is not identical to the export you just imported!\n\n"
						+ "\t" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
						+ "\n\n\tConsider adding these principals to your 'pre-deploy.conf' (see https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf) and re-importing.\n"
						+ "###############################################################################"
				);
				publishWarningMessage(title, text);
			}
```
