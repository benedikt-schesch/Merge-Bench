The merge conflict arises from the removal and subsequent re-addition of the same line. Both branches want to assert that `comments.getCanComment()` is true. Since both sides include this assertion, the correct resolution is to retain it.

```java
    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getComments());
    Comments comments = exampleRating.getComments();
    assertEquals("chronological", comments getOrder());
    assertEquals(1L, comments.getTotalCount().longValue());
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertTrue(comments.getCanComment());
=======

    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getLikes());
    Likes likes = exampleRating.getLikes();
    assertEquals(0L, likes.getTotalCount().longValue());
    assertTrue(likes.getCanLike());
```
