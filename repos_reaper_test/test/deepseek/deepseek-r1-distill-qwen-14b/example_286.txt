The code snippet contains a merge conflict between two changes. One side adds a `boolean[] readOnce` field while the other adds a `PigNullableWritable keyWritable` field. Both changes appear to be adding new fields to the class but for different purposes.

Without additional context about the intent of these changes, it's unclear which change should take precedence. Therefore, I will return the snippet with the conflict as it is.

```java

    private boolean useDefaultBag = false;

    protected Packager pkgr;

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private boolean[] readOnce;
=======
    private PigNullableWritable keyWritable;
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a

    public POPackage(OperatorKey k) {
        this(k, -1, null);
    }


```
