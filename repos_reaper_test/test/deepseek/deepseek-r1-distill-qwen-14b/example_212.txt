The code snippet contains a merge conflict where two different changes are trying to set variables `retPos` and either `newPos` or `oldPos`. The conflict is being resolved by selecting the version from the right side (`newPos = zStream.tell()`) because it aligns with the variable naming and initialization intended by the code's author.

```java
    // and we set retPos to newPos once we have read a character from that block.
    // see getPos() for more detail
    private long retPos, newPos = -1;

    public CBZip2InputStream(SeekableInputStream zStream, int blockSize) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        retPos = oldPos = zStream.tell();
=======
        retPos = newPos = zStream.tell();

    	ll8 = null;
        tt = null;
        checkComputedCombinedCRC = blockSize == -1;
        bsSetStream(zStream);
        initialize(blockSize);
```
