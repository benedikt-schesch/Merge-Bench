The merge conflict involves importing different static methods. The original code uses `buildCli`, while the new change imports `singleCommand`. After considering the potential refactor or API change, it's appropriate to switch to the new method.

import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

import static io.airlift.command.SingleCommand.singleCommand;

@Test
public class HelpTest
{
