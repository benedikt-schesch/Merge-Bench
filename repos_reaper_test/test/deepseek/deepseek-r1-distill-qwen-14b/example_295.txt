The code snippet shows a merge conflict where two different branches have diverged in their handling of the `else` block. One branch adds a call to `handleUnsupportedGenerator(jsonGenerator)`, while the other does not include this call.

Since the intent of both changes is unclear and could be based on different requirements, it's safer to present the conflict and let you decide how to proceed based on your project's needs.

```java

                jsonGenerator.writeStartObject();
                jsonGenerator.writeFieldName("$numberDecimal");
                jsonGenerator.writeString(decimal.bigDecimalValue().toString());
                jsonGenerator.writeEndObject();

                handleUnsupportedGenerator(jsonGenerator);
