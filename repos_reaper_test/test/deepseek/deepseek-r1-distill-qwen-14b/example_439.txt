The snippet shows a merge conflict where one side (HEAD) has no changes in the indicated area, while the other side (308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5) has added two new methods: `isWatched()` and `setWatched()`. The methods appear to track whether something is "watched" and modify the corresponding boolean field.

Given the context, it seems the intent is to add these methods to the class since they are logically related to the existing `created` field and its setter. There's no evidence of deletion intent, so the methods should be kept.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
    }

    public void setCreated(long created) {
        this.created = created;
    }

    public boolean isWatched() {
        return isWatched;
    }

    public void setWatched(boolean isWatched) {
        this.isWatched = isWatched;
    }
}
```
