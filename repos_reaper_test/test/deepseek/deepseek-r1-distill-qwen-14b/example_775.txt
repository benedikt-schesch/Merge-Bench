The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two sets of changes. One side adds an import for `org.slf4j.Logger`, while the other adds an import for `org.hbase.async.test.Common` and a comment. The import for `Logger` seems necessary for logging, whereas the `Common` import might be for test utilities, which might not be needed here. The comment line is incomplete, adding to the ambiguity.

Since the intent isn't entirely clear and to avoid making incorrect assumptions, the conflict should remain unresolved.
