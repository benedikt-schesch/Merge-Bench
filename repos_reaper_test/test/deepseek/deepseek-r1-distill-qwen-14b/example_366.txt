The conflict arises because one side creates a `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` without the URL, while the other includes it. Given that the URL is essential for the request and consistency with `buildGetRequest`, the correct resolution is to include the URL.

```java
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPostRequest(String url) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest();
=======
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
>>>>>>> f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPutRequest(String url) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD

  }
```
