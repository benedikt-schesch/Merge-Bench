To resolve the merge conflict, we should determine the correct parameters to pass to the superclass constructor. Since the left side includes the PUT operation, it's appropriate to keep it unless the superclass no longer expects that parameter. Given no indication of such a change, the left side is correct.

```java
                     final byte[] family,
                     final byte[][] qualifiers,
                     final byte[][] values,
                     final long timestamp,
                     final long lockid) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    super(PUT, table, key, family, timestamp, lockid);
=======
    super(table, key, family, timestamp, lockid);
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    KeyValue.checkFamily(family);
    if (qualifiers.length != values.length) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Have " + qualifiers.length
        + " qualifiers and " + values.length + " values.  Should be equal.");
    } else if (qualifiers.length == 0) {
```
