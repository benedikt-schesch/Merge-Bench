The code snippet shows a merge conflict in the comment formatting. The difference is only a space after the `//` comment delimiter.

```java
    public Result getNext() throws ExecException {
        if (bags == null) {
            return new Result(POStatus.STATUS_EOP, null);
        }

<<<<<<< HEAD
        // Create numInputs bags
=======
        //Create numInputs bags
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a
        Object[] fields = new Object[mBags.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < mBags.length; i++) {
            if (mBags[i]) fields[i] = createDataBag(numBags);
        }
```

This is a trivial formatting difference that doesn't affect the code's functionality. The decision to resolve this conflict would depend on coding style preferences, such as whether to include the space after the comment delimiter.
