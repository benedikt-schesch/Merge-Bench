The conflict appears to be a style difference where one side adds braces around the if statement's body while the other does not.

Both implementations behave the same semantically since the single statement in the if block doesn't require braces, but adding braces improves code readability and makes it clearer that the block is intentional.

I'll resolve in favor of adding the braces since it's a common practice to make control flow more explicit.

```java
                    && config.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT)) {
                nativeLandscape = true;
            }

            int orientationCompensation = mOrientation; // + (nativeLandscape ? 0 : 90);
            if (orientationCompensation == 90) {
                orientationCompensation += 180;
            } else if (orientationCompensation == 270) {
                orientationCompensation -= 180;
            }
```
