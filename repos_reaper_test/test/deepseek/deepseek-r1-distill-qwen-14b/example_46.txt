The code snippet shows a merge conflict where one side uses the older `HashMap` initialization without the diamond operator, and the other uses the modern syntax with the diamond operator. Both achieve the same result, but the latter is cleaner and preferred.

```java
   *                        sent to people in the game.
   * @return This game's general information: ID, host, state, player list, etc.
   */

    info.put(GameInfo.ID, id);
    // This is probably happening because the game ceases to exist in the middle of getting the
    // game list. Just return nothing.
    if (null == host) {
      return null;
```
