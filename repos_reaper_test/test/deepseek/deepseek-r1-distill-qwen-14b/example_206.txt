The code snippet shows a merge conflict where the only difference is the presence of an empty line after the `registerStreamingCommand` method. Both sides of the merge have an empty line, but the exact number might differ. Since this is a style issue and the intent is to separate methods with a blank line, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping a single empty line.

```java
     * @param command - streaming command to be executed
     */
    public void registerStreamingCommand(String commandAlias, StreamingCommand command) {
        pigContext.registerStreamCmd(commandAlias, command);
    }
    
    private URL locateJarFromResources(String jarName) throws IOException {
        Enumeration<URL> urls = ClassLoader.getSystemResources(jarName);
        URL resourceLocation = null;
        
        if (urls.hasMoreElements()) {
```
