The conflict appears to involve changing the type of the `picture` field and removing Lombok annotations. The left side (HEAD) defines `picture` as a `ProfilePictureSource` with Lombok's `@Getter` and `@Setter`, while the right side changes it to a `String` without the annotations.

Given the surrounding context includes a `rawPicture` field annotated with `@Facebook("picture")`, which is a `JsonObject`, it suggests the intent might have been to simplify the field. However, removing the annotations and changing the type could lead to issues. The right side's intent is unclear, so the conflict remains to avoid introducing new issues.
