The merge conflict involves adding the `final` modifier to the `sJobConfInternal` variable. Since the only change is adding `final` and no surrounding context suggests a need for flexibility, it's safe to resolve in favor of the modified version.

```java
     * <pre>UdfContext.getUdfContext().getJobConf()</pre>
     */
    @Deprecated
    public static Configuration sJobConf = null;

    public static final ThreadLocal<Configuration> sJobConfInternal = new ThreadLocal<Configuration>();

    public static class Map extends PigMapBase {

        @Override
        public void collect(Context oc, Tuple tuple)
```
