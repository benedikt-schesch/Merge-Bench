The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two assertion statements. Both lines assert that the `counter` equals 18, but use different assertion methods (`assertThat` from AssertJ vs `assertEquals` from TestNG/JUnit). The context does not provide enough information to determine which assertion style is intended.

```java
      for (FacebookType type : page) {
        counter++;
      }
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertThat(counter).isEqualTo(18);
=======
    assertEquals(18, counter);
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_snapshot() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();
```
