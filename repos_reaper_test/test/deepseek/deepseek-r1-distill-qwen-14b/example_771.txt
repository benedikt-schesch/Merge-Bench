The conflict arises from two changes: adding a boolean `at_timestamp_only` and introducing a new constructor for deleting entire rows. Both are valid and should coexist.

```java

  /** Special value for {@link #family} when deleting a whole row.  */
  static final byte[] WHOLE_ROW = new byte[0];

  private final byte[][] qualifiers;
  /** Whether to delete the value only at the specified timestamp. */
  private boolean at_timestamp_only = false;

  /**
   * Constructor to delete an entire row.
   * <strong>These byte arrays will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @param table The table to edit.
   * @param family Column family for the delete operation.
   * @param qualifiers Array of byte arrays representing column qualifiers.
   */
  public Delete(Table table, byte[] family, byte[][] qualifiers) {
    super(table, family, qualifiers != null ? Arrays.copyOf(qualifiers, qualifiers.length) : null);
    this.qualifiers = qualifiers;
  }

  /**
   * Constructor to delete an entire row.
   * <strong>These byte arrays will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @param table The table to edit.
