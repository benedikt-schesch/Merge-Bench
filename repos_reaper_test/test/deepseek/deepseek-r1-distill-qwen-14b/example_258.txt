Here is the full snippet with the merge conflict, preserved as is, along with my analysis:

```java
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POSkewedJoin;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POSort;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POSplit;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POStore;

```

#### Analysis:
1. **Conflict Identification**: 
   - The conflict occurs between two sets of changes:
     - **HEAD**: No import for `Packager` is present.
     - **Commit 88ae4a5**: Adds an import for `Packager`.

2. **Intent Consideration**:
   - **Importer**: The intent of the commit (88ae4a5) is likely to include functionality related to `Packager`.
   - **Remover**: The intent of HEAD suggests that `Packager` was either removed due to unused code, or the import was thought unnecessary.

3. **Ambiguity**:
   - Without knowledge of the full codebase, it's unclear whether `Packager` is needed elsewhere in the project.
   - This makes the conflict's resolution ambiguous.

### Conclusion:
Due to the uncertainty regarding `Packager`'s necessity, the conflict should remain unresolved until more context is available.
