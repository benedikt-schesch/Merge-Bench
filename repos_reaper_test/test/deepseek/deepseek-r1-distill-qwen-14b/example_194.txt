The conflict appears to be between a method that processes a function specification string and a refactored version that uses a `FuncSpec` object to encapsulate the parsing and instantiation. The right side suggests a more efficient and encapsulated approach by using the `FuncSpec` object.

Here is the merged code, choosing the right side as it uses encapsulation:

```java
            throw new RuntimeException(sb.toString(), e);
        }
        return ret;
    }
    
    public static Object instantiateFuncFromSpec(String funcSpec)  {
        return instantiateFuncFromSpec(new FuncSpec(funcSpec));
    }
    
    
    public Class getClassForAlias(String alias) throws IOException{
