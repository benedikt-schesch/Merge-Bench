The merge conflict involves differences in how the test asserts the values from the iterator. The original code uses `getAtomField(0).longVal()` with numeric comparisons, while the changed code uses `get(0)` with string literals. Given the context of lexicographic ordering, the latter is more appropriate if the data is treated as strings.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
        pigServer.registerQuery("c1 = order c by value;");

        // order in lexicographic, so 12 comes before 2
        Iterator<Tuple> iter = pigServer.openIterator("b1");
        assertTrue("b1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
        assertEquals("first item in b1", iter.next().get(0), "12");
        assertTrue("b1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
        assertEquals("second item in b1", iter.next().get(0), "2");
        assertFalse("b1 is over", iter.hasNext());

        iter = pigServer.openIterator("c1");
        assertTrue("c1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
        // The rest of the code follows...
```
