The conflict appears to be between two versions of an import statement for the `Json` class from the `com.restfb.json` package. The left side (HEAD) has the import while the right side (through commit a17acec) does not include it. Based on the surrounding imports, particularly the `import com.restfb.json.JsonObject` line, it appears that `JsonObject` is being used instead of the more general `Json` type.
