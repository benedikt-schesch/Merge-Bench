The conflict in the code involves whether the `isMtls` method should be annotated with `@Beta`. The left side lacks the annotation, while the right side includes it. Both changes reflect different assessments of the method's stability. Without clear context, the best course is to preserve the conflict.

```java
  public boolean supportsMethod(String method) {
    return Arrays.binarySearch(SUPPORTED_METHODS, method) >= 0;
  }

  @Override
<<<<<<< HEAD
  @Beta
=======

  public boolean isMtls() {
    return this.isMtls;
  }

  @Override
```
