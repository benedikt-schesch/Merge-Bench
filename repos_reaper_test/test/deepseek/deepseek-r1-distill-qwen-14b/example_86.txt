The conflict arises because one version adds `newMaxBlanks` while another replaces it with `newMaxSpectators`. The correct resolution is to use `newMaxSpectators` as it matches the variable name in the method body.

```java
  public String getPassword() {
    return password;
  }

  public void updateGameSettings(final int newScoreGoal, final int newMaxPlayers,
      final int newMaxSpectators,
      final Set<CardSet> newCardSets, final String newPassword, final boolean newUseTimer) {
    this.scoreGoal = newScoreGoal;
    this.maxPlayers = newMaxPlayers;
    this.maxSpectators = newMaxSpectators;
    synchronized (this.cardSets) {
      this.cardSets.clear();
```
