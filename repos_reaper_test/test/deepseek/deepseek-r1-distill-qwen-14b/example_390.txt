The merge conflict involves a method name change and a comment modification. The local code keeps the method name `shouldRespondToPostChangeEvents()`, while the incoming change renames it to `shouldNotRespondToPostChangeEvents()` and adds a comment explaining the reasoning.

Given the ambiguity in intent, the conflict is preserved as is.

```java
		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

	@Test
<<<<<<< HEAD
	void shouldRespondToPostChangeEvents() {
=======
	public void shouldNotRespondToPostChangeEvents() {
		// Not sure why we wanted to respond to change events, seems better to respond to the post build event, once the build is finished
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, POST_CHANGE, AUTO_BUILD, null);
		assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event));

		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}
