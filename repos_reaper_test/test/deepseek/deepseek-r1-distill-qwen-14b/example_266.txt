The merge conflict appears to be related to formatting of a comment block. Both sides have the same content but different formatting. The left side has the comment aligned with the code, while the right side has a more compact formatting. Since the content is identical, the conflict is purely stylistic.

I will resolve this conflict by preferring the format on the right side as it appears to be more concise and potentially more readable in certain contexts.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
 * it does not use the index in the NullableTuple to find the bag to put a
 * tuple in.  Instead, the inputs are put in a bag corresponding to their
 * offset in the tuple.
 */
public class CombinerPackager extends Packager {

    private boolean[] mBags; // For each field, indicates whether or not it
    // needs to be put in a bag.

    private Map<Integer, Integer> keyLookup;

    private int numBags;
