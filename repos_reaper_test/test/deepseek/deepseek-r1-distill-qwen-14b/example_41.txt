The merge conflict is due to a stylistic difference in the logger.info line. Both sides log the same message but with different formatting. The intended behavior is to log when the game resets due to too few players. 

The conflict can be resolved by choosing one formatting style. I'll remove the line break for consistency.

```java
      // this seems terrible
      if (players.size() == 0) {
        gameManager.destroyGame(id);
      }
      if (players.size() < 3 && state != GameState.LOBBY) {
        logger.info(String.format("Resetting game %d due to too few players after someone left.", id));
        resetState(true);
      } else if (wasJudge) {
        synchronized (roundTimerLock) {
          final SafeTimerTask task = new SafeTimerTask() {
            @Override
```
