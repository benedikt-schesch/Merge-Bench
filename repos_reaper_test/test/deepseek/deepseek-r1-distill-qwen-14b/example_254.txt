The merge conflict appears to be related to the addition or removal of blank lines between methods. Both changes aim to adjust the spacing between `visitPackage` and `visitPOForEach`. Since the intent is merely to separate the methods with appropriate whitespace, either side's approach is acceptable.

Here is the resolved snippet, adopting the right-hand side's changes:

```java
    }

    public void visitPackage(POPackage pkg) throws VisitorException{
        //do nothing
    }
    
    public void visitPOForEach(POForEach nfe) throws VisitorException {
        List<PhysicalPlan> inpPlans = nfe getInputPlans();
        for (PhysicalPlan plan : inpPlans) {
            pushWalker(mCurrentWalker.spawnChildWalker(plan));
            visit();
```
