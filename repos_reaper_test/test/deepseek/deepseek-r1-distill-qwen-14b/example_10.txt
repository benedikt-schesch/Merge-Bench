The merge conflict is in the import statements for `Vector3`. Both branches are trying to import the same class but from potentially different sources or versions. Since the intent is to import `Vector3` from `org.spout.api.math`, we'll keep that import and remove the duplicate.

```java
import org.spout.api.entity.Player;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Point;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Transform;
import org.spout.api.math.ReactConverter;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
import org.spout.engine.world.SpoutRegion;
import org.spout.math.imaginary.Quaternion;
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.physics.body.MobileRigidBody;
import org.spout.physics.body.RigidBody;
```
