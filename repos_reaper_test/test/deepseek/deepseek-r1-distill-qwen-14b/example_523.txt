The code snippet shows a merge conflict where one side has the declaration `private int maxImageSize;` and the other does not. Since the purpose of this variable isn't clear from the context provided, it's best to leave the conflict unresolved.

```java
    private String code = null;
    private int options = 1;
    private String mhtmlRoot = "";
    private String outputFilename = "";
    private int maxUriLength = DEFAULT_MAX_URI_LENGTH;  //IE8 only allows dataURIs up to 32KB
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private int maxImageSize;
