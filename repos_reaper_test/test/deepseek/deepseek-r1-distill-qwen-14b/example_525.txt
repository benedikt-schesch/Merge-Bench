The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict where both sides attempt to handle similar conditions with slight variations in their implementation. The left side (HEAD) and the right side each have an `if` statement checking for maximum URI length, but they differ in their messages and structure.

The right side (new change) simplifies the condition by removing the redundant `else if` and adjusts the message to be more consistent. Therefore, the right side should be chosen as it improves code clarity and removes redundancy.

```java
                        if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength) {
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                            }      
                            builder.append(url);
                        } else if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength){
                            if (verbose) {
                                System.err.println("[INFO] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI longer than " + maxUriLength + " characters. Skipping.");
                            }
