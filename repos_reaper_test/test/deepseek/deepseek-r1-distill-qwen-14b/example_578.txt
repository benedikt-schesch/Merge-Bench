The code snippet contains a merge conflict in the imports section. One branch imports `com.restfb.JsonMapper`, while the other imports `com.restfb.JsonMapper.JsonMappingCompleted`. The conflict is as follows:

```java
import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromLongFormat;
import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromShortFormat;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;

import com.restfb.Facebook;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import com.restfb.JsonMapper;
=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
import com.restfb.JsonMapper.JsonMappingCompleted;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
```

Both imports relate to the `JsonMapper` class, but the intent for which one to keep is ambiguous. Without more context on how `JsonMapper` and `JsonMappingCompleted` are used elsewhere, it's unclear which import is appropriate. Therefore, the conflict is preserved as the final decision would depend on the specific needs of the codebase.
