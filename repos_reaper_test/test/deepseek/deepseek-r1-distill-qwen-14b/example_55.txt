The code snippet shows a merge conflict in a Java file, specifically in the `metrics.gameStart` method call. The left side (HEAD) shows the method call with parameters on separate lines, while the right side (5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a) shows the same call with parameters on a single line.

The conflict arises from differing code formatting styles: the left side prefers parameters on separate lines for better readability, while the right side uses a more compact format. Since both approaches aim to improve code clarity but differ in style, it's best to preserve the original style with parameters on separate lines to maintain consistency.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
        synchronized (options.cardSetIds) {
          cardSets = loadCardSets(session);
          blackDeck = loadBlackDeck(cardSets);
          whiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
        }
        metrics.gameStart(currentUniqueId, cardSets, options.blanksInDeck, options.playerLimit,
            options.scoreGoal, !StringUtils.isBlank(options.password));
        startNextRound();
        gameManager.broadcastGameListRefresh();
      }
      return started;
    } finally {

```
