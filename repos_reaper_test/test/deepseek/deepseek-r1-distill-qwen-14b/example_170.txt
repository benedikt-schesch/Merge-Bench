The merge conflict arises from differing Javadoc comments for the `openDFSFile` method. The new version adds `@param`, `@return`, and `@throws` tags, enhancing documentation. Both changes aim to improve code clarity, but the more detailed version is better.

Here is the resolved code with the updated Javadoc:

```java
            return fileSpec;
        return (execType == ExecType.LOCAL ? LOCAL_PREFIX : "") + fileSpec;
    }

    /**
     * This function is meant to be used if the mappers/reducers want to access any HDFS file.
     * @param fileName
     * @return InputStream of the open file.
     * @throws IOException
     */
    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        SliceWrapper wrapper = PigInputFormat.getActiveSplit();

        if (wrapper == null)
```
