The merge conflict involves the removal of `private Random r;` and the addition of `private UDFFinder udfFinder;`, `private CompilationMessageCollector messageCollector = null;`, and `private Map<PhysicalOperator,MapReduceOper> phyToMROpMap;`. 

The `Random r` variable is being removed, possibly because it's no longer needed, and new variables are being added. These new variables (`udfFinder`, `messageCollector`, `phyToMROpMap`) are likely essential for the class's functionality. Therefore, the `Random r` line should be removed, and the new variables should be kept.

```java
    Map<OperatorKey, MapReduceOper> splitsSeen;

    NodeIdGenerator nig;

    private String scope;

    private Random r;

    private UDFFinder udfFinder;

    private CompilationMessageCollector messageCollector = null;

    private Map<PhysicalOperator,MapReduceOper> phyToMROpMap;
