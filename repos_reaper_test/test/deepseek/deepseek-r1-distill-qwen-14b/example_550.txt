The code context shows a merge conflict in the line wrapping of the method parameters. Both changes aim to adjust code formatting but don't affect functionality. The right side's single-line version is chosen for conciseness.

```java
        }

        return definition;
    }

    public static List<Class> getAllResources(Application application, List<Class> resources) {
        List<Class> allResources = new ArrayList<>();
        if (application != null) {
            if (application.getClasses() != null) {
                allResources.addAll(application.getClasses());
            }
```
