The code snippet shows a merge conflict where both sides declare a new ArrayList using slightly different syntax. The conflict is purely syntactic, with `new ArrayList<Player>(players.size())` (HEAD) versus `new ArrayList<>(players.size())` (other side). 

The diamond operator in the latter is a modern shorthand for the same functionality. They both create a list of the correct size without affecting the outcome. Therefore, either form can be used.

Here's the code with the conflict as-is, and the resolved version using the diamond operator:

```java
    }
    return info;
  }

  public final List<Player> getPlayers() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    final List<Player> copy = new ArrayList<Player>(players.size());
=======
    final List<Player> copy = new ArrayList<>(players.size());
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
    copy.addAll(players);
    return copy;
  }
