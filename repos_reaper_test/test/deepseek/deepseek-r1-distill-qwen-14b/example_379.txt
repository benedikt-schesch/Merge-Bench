The code snippet shows a merge conflict where an import of `OnClickListener` is removed and replaced with an import of `Intent`.

The `OnClickListener` import is part of the `DialogInterface` and is used for handling events on buttons or other UI elements within dialogs. The removal suggests that the code is moving away from DialogInterface-based interactions, possibly due to a refactor to use a different approach for handling clicks or navigating between activities.

The addition of the `Intent` import indicates that the code might now be using Intents to handle navigation between activities, likely in conjunction with the `RecyclerView` and `LinearLayoutManager` that are already present in the imports. This change could be part of a larger refactor to improve the UI flow or to adhere to a different design pattern.

Since `OnClickListener` is being removed and no longer referenced elsewhere (as per the provided snippet), and `Intent` is essential for activity transitions, the correct resolution is to replace `OnClickListener` with `Intent`.
