The code snippet shows a merge conflict where two changes are attempting to modify the same file. Here's the full context and conflict:

```java
    final GetRequest rpc = new GetRequest(0F, table, key);
    rpc.family(family);
    return rpc;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
  /** Returns true if this is actually an "Get" RPC. */
  private boolean isGetRequest() {
    return (versions & EXIST_FLAG) == 0;
  }

>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
  /**
   * Specifies a particular column family to get.
   * @param family The column family.
   * <strong>This byte array will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @return {@code this}, always.
```

This shows that one branch (HEAD) has the original code, while the other branch (d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f) has added a new method `isGetRequest()` with a Javadoc comment.

The conflict is safe to resolve by merging in the change that adds the documentation since it doesn't affect the existing functionality.
