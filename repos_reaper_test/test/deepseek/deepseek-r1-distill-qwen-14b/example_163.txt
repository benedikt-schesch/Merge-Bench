The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict between two import statements. The conflict occurs because the code is trying to import both `BufferedInputStream` and `BufferedReader`. To resolve this, we need to determine which import is necessary based on the surrounding code's functionality.

Since the context includes `FileOutputStream` and other file-related imports, it suggests the code is handling file operations. `BufferedReader` is typically used for reading text lines, while `BufferedInputStream` is for buffered binary input. Without further context on the code's usage, it's ambiguous which import should be kept.

To resolve this, we'll assume the code requires `BufferedReader` if text operations are involved, or `BufferedInputStream` for binary data. Here's the resolved snippet:
