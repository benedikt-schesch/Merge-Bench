The merge conflict involves a minor change in a log message from "Connect failed" to "Connection failed". Both changes aim to improve clarity, but "Connection failed" is slightly more precise. There's no functional impact, so the new version is preferable.

```java
  private final String logAlreadyScanning = "Scanning already in progress";
  private final String logScanStartFail = "Scan failed to start";
  private final String logNotScanning = "Not scanning";
  //Connection
  private final String logPreviouslyConnected = "Device previously connected, reconnect or close for new device";
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private final String logConnectFail = "Connect failed";
=======
  private final String logConnectFail = "Connection failed";

  private final String logNeverConnected = "Never connected to device";
  private final String logIsNotConnected = "Device isn't connected";
  private final String logIsNotDisconnected = "Device isn't disconnected";
  private final String logIsDisconnected = "Device is disconnected";
  private final String logNoAddress = "No device address";
```
