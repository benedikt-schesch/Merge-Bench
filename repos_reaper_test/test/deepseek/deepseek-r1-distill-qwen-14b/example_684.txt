The provided code snippet has a merge conflict in the text string construction part. Here's the code with the conflict preserved:

```java
		applyConfigurationFileIfExists(context, source.resolve("post-data-deploy.conf"), DEPLOYMENT_DATA_IMPORT_STATUS);

		if (!missingPrincipals.isEmpty()) {

			final String title = "Missing Principal(s)";
<<<<<<< HEAD
			final String text = "The following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for resource access permissions or node ownership during <b>data deployment</b>.<br>"
					+ "Because of these missing permissions/ownerships, <b>node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported</b>."
					+ "<ul><li>" + String.join("</li><li>",  missingPrincipals) + "</li></ul>"
=======
			final String text = "The following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during <b>data deployment</b>.<br>"
					+ "Because of these missing grants/ownerships, <b>node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported</b>!"
					+ "<ul><li>" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>")) + "</li></ul>"
>>>>>>> 83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965
					+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf\">pre-data-deploy.conf</a> and re-importing.";

			logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
					+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
			logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
					+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
>>>>>>> 83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965
					+ "Missing principals: " + String.join(", ", missingPrincipals) + ".\n"
					+ "###############################################################################\n");
		}
```

The conflict involves:
1. Differences in the wording of the warning message:
   - Left side mentions "resource access permissions or node ownership" and "permissions/ownerships"
   - Right side mentions "grants or node ownership" and "grants/ownerships"
2. Different ways of joining the missing principals in the list
3. A formatting difference in the logger info section

To resolve this, you would need to:
1. Decide whether the terminology in the message should use "permissions", "grants", or a combination
2. Decide whether the principals should be sorted before being displayed
3. Decide whether to keep the original formatting of the logger info section or adopt the alternative formatting

Choose the changes that best align with your project's documentation and coding standards.
