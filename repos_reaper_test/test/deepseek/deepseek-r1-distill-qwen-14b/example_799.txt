The code snippet shows a merge conflict where the method `deserializeObject` is being modified. The original version includes `rpcid` as a parameter, while the new version removes it and makes the method static. Since `rpcid` isn't used in the method body, removing it simplifies the code. The method can logically be static as it doesn't rely on instance variables.

```java
   * De-serializes a "Writable" serialized by
   * {@code HbaseObjectWritable#writeObject}.
   * @return The de-serialized object (which can be {@code null}).
