The merge conflict is due to differing method calls to retrieve the likes count in the test. The left side uses `page.getLikesCount().longValue()`, while the right side uses `page.getLikes().longValue()`. Both lines assert that the likes count is 3L. Without knowing the exact API changes, it's unclear which method is correct. Given that `getLikes()` is more concise, it's potentially the newer change. Therefore, resolving in favor of the right side.

```java
  @Test
  public void checkV2_6_fanCount() {
    Page page = createJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonFromClasspath("v2_6/page-with-fancount"), Page.class);
    assertNotNull(page);
    assertEquals(3L, page.getFanCount().longValue());
    assertEquals(3L, page.getLikes().longValue());
  }

  @Test
  public void checkV2_5_fanCount() {
    Page page = createJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonFromClasspath("v2_5/page-with-likes"), Page.class);
```
