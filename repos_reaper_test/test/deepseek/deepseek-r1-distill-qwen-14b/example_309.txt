The code snippet provided shows a merge conflict in a Java file. The context includes a method that closes a reader and marks a stream as consumed, followed by a return statement. The conflict arises between the original return statement and an empty line, which would cause a syntax error if applied. Both sides of the merge likely intended to return the string "str", so the conflict should be resolved by retaining the original return statement.

```java
            if (reader != null) {
                reader.close();
                setStreamConsumed(true);
            }
        }

    public JSONObject asJSONObject() throws ResponseException {
        try {
            return new JSONObject(asString());
