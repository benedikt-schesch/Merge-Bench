To resolve this merge conflict, I need to consider the intent behind each change. The key changes involve setting a configuration property and parsing a file into a map, followed by an assertion on the resulting tags.

1. **Property Setting**: The `config.setProperty` line should use `TAG_SANITIZE.getKey()` to ensure it's using the correct key for the sanitize property.
2. **Map Type**: Changing `DocumentModel` to `Map<String, Object>` suggests a refactor towards standard interfaces, which should be adopted.
3. **Assertion**: The test expects sanitized tags, so the assertion should check for "tag-with-space" instead of "tag with space".

Here is the resolved code:

```java
        assertThat(map.getTags()).isEqualTo(Arrays.asList("jbake", "java", "tag with space").toArray());
    }

    @Test
    public void sanitizeTags() {
        config.setProperty(TAG_SANITIZE.getKey(), true);
        Map<String, Object> map = parser.processFile(validaAsciidocWithUnsanitizedHeader);

        assertThat(map.getTags()).isEqualTo(Arrays.asList("jbake", "java", "tag-with-space").toArray());
    }
```
