The provided code snippet has a merge conflict in the import statements. The conflicting line is:

```java
import de.javakaffee.web.msm.BackupSessionService.SimpleFuture;
```

This import is trying to bring in `SimpleFuture` from `BackupSessionService`, but it's unclear if this is needed in the current context. The rest of the imports don't include this specific class or package.

If this class is necessary for the functionality, the import should be kept. If not, it can be safely removed. Since there isn't enough context about how `SimpleFuture` is used in the rest of the code, it's safer to assume it's not needed unless it's explicitly used elsewhere.

Here's the code with the conflict resolved by keeping only the necessary imports:

```java
import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.AfterMethod;
import org.testng.annotations.BeforeMethod;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

import de.javakaffee.web.msm.LockingStrategy.LockingMode;
import de.javakaffee.web.msm.MemcachedSessionService.SessionManager;
import de.javakaffee.web.msm.SessionTrackerValve.SessionBackupService.BackupResultStatus;
import de.javakaffee.web.msm.integration.TestUtils;
```
