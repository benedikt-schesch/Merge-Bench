The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict in the test method `checkNullJson()`. The conflict is between the `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(FacebookJsonMappingException.class);` line (original) and the deletion of that line (new change). Both changes have slightly different intentions, but the specific semantic intent and context are not fully clear, so the conflict remains unresolved.
