The conflict involves adding a new constant `CHUNK_SIZE` while keeping existing constants and the `Holder` class. To resolve, we merge all elements.

```java

    public static final int FALSE = 0;

    public static final int TRUE = 1;

    public static final int CHUNK_SIZE = 50;

    private static class Holder {

        private static final DatabaseHelper instance = new DatabaseHelper();

    }
```
