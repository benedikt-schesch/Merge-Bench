The code snippet shows a merge conflict where an additional import statement was added for `com.restfb.types.Checkin.Place.Location`.

```java
import com.restfb.Facebook;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper.JsonMappingCompleted;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookJsonMappingException;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import com.restfb.types.Checkin.Place.Location;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
import com.restfb.util.DateUtils;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
```

I noticed that:
1. The import for `Location` appears to be in the middle of the file
2. The import has a merge conflict marker

The intent of the added import seems to be to bring in the `Location` class from the `Checkin.Place` package, but:
1. We can't be certain if this import is correct or necessary
2. The placement of the import in the middle of the file appears unusual

Without more context about how `Location` is being used in the file, it's difficult to determine the correct resolution. If you can confirm whether this import is needed and if it belongs in this location, I can help resolve the conflict appropriately.
