The conflict appears to be purely stylistic, with both changes setting the same value but formatted differently. The right side (https://github.com/[owner]/[repo]/commit/c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c) splits the line for better readability while the left side keeps it as a single line. Both changes maintain the same functionality.

Here is the resolved snippet with the change that improves readability by splitting the line:

```java

        private void initialize() {
            // Set padding
            int pad = getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.widget_container_padding) * 2;
            this.setPadding(pad, pad, pad, pad);
            this.setMinimumHeight(getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(
                    R.dimen.widget_option_button_size) * 3);
        }

        @Override
        public void onFinishInflate() {
            super.onFinishInflate();
```
