The code snippet shows a merge conflict where one branch modifies the `run()` method while another leaves it empty. The left side of the conflict (HEAD) has code that configures the parser for interactive mode and handles parsing on errors, which is more complete. The right side (non-HEAD) has an empty `run()` method, which is less useful.

To resolve this, we'll keep the implementation from HEAD since it provides necessary functionality.

```java
        if (in != null)
        {
            parser = new GruntParser(in);
            parser.setParams(pig);    
       }
    }

    public void run() {
    parser.setInteractive(true);
    parser.parseContOnError();
    }

    public void setConsoleReader(ConsoleReader c)
    {
        parser.setConsoleReader(c);
```
