The code snippet has a merge conflict where both changes are stylistic and don't affect functionalityâ€”specifically, an extra space at the end of a line. Since neither side conveys a different intent, either can be chosen based on style preferences. Here, I'll resolve the conflict by selecting the left side (HEAD) as it aligns with typical coding standards of avoiding trailing spaces.

```java
        POPackage pkg = new POPackage(new OperatorKey(scope,nig.getNextNodeId(scope)));
        Packager pkgr = new Packager();
        pkg.setPkgr(pkgr);
        pkgr.setKeyType(DataType.CHARARRAY);
        pkg.setNumInps(1);
        boolean[] inner = {false};
        pkgr.setInner(inner);
        mro.reducePlan.add(pkg);

        // Lets start building the plan which will have the sort
        // for the foreach
```
