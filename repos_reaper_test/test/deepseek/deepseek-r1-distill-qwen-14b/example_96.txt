The code includes a merge conflict between different import statements. The right side (ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967) adds imports for Google Guice's `Inject` and `Provider`, while the left side (HEAD) does not include these imports. The existing code already has an import for `net.socialgamer.cah.CahModule.*`, suggesting that dependency injection might be in use.

Given that the code context includes `@Inject` and `Provider` from Guice, the right side's changes are necessary to enable proper dependency injection. The left side's removal of these imports likely caused unintended issues.
