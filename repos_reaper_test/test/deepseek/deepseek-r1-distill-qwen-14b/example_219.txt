The merge conflict is between two import statements. One uses a static import for `MAPREDUCE`, while the other imports the `ExecType` class directly. The initial import on the HEAD side is a static import, which allows using `MAPREDUCE` withoutqualification. The other side removes the static import, implying they prefer importing the class.

Given the surrounding context, the code imports other classes non-statically. This suggests that the team may favor non-static imports. Therefore, the conflict should be resolved by removing the static import and using `ExecType` directly.
