The conflict is due to a difference in line endings (a tab vs. no tab). Both changes achieve the same semantic intent. Since this is a style difference, either choice is acceptable. 

Here is the resolved snippet with the right-hand side (no tab) to avoid trailing whitespace:

```java
import org.apache.pig.impl.util.WrappedIOException;

public class PigContext implements Serializable, FunctionInstantiator {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    
    private transient final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());
    
    public static final String JOB_NAME = "jobName";
    public static final String JOB_NAME_PREFIX= "PigLatin";
    
    /* NOTE: we only serialize some of the stuff 

```
