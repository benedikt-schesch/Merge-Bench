The code snippet shows a merge conflict in a Java class. The conflict is over whether the class `POPackageTupleBuffer` should be declared as `public` or not. Both sides of the merge (HEAD and the other branch) have different intentions regarding the accessibility of this class. Without additional context about the intended usage of the class, it's unclear which side of the conflict should be resolved. Therefore, the conflict will be preserved as is.

```java
        clone.numInputs = numInputs;
        clone.pkgr = (Packager) this.pkgr.clone();
        return clone;
