The code snippet includes a merge conflict where one side has a Javadoc comment for the `getData()` method and the other does not. The right side (newer) adds proper documentation, which is beneficial for code clarity and maintainability. Therefore, we should resolve the conflict by keeping the Javadoc from the right side.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
  private List<Comment> data = new ArrayList<Comment>();

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  /**
   * @see java.lang.Object#hashCode()
   */
  /**
   * The comments.
   *
   * @return The comments.
   */
  public List<Comment> getData() {
```
