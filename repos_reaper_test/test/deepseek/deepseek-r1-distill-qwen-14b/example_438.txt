The merge conflict arises from two different changes being made in the same file. One branch adds constants related to palette visibility and vibrancy, while another branch adds a constant for a library update action. Both sets of constants are necessary for different features, so they should be merged together.

```java
    public static final String PREFS_USER_KEY = "user";
    public static final String PREFS_PASSWORD_KEY = "password";

    public static final String VIDEO_UPDATE_ACTION = "videoUpdateAction";
    
    public static final String PALETTE_VISIBILITY = "paletteVisibility";
    public static final String PALETTE_VIBRANCY = "paletteVibrancy";
    public static final String LIBRARY_UPDATED_ACTION = "libraryUpdatedAction";
}
```
