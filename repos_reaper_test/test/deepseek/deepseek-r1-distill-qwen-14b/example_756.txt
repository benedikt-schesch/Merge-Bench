```java
            // bind to service
            mServiceConnection = new OpenPgpServiceConnection(
                    PgpHandler.this, providerPackageName, this);
            mServiceConnection.bindToService();

            bindingDialog = new ProgressDialog(this);
            bindingDialog.setMessage(this.getResources().getString(R.string.okc_progress_text));
            bindingDialog.setCancelable(false);
            bindingDialog.show();

            registered = true;
            getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);
        }
    }
```

**Merge Resolution Explanation:**
- Both sides of the merge attempted to enhance the binding process but in different ways.
- The HEAD side added a ProgressDialog to provide visual feedback during binding.
- The new branch added state tracking (`registered = true`) and enabled the home button for navigation.
- These changes are complementary and can coexist to provide both user feedback and proper navigation handling.
