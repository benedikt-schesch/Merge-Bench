The merge conflict appears to be related to the placement of an empty line and the presence of a `serialVersionUID` field in the `VideoStatus` class. On one side of the conflict, the `serialVersionUID` is present, while on the other side, it is not. 

Given that the `serialVersionUID` is a standard field in Java for serializing objects, its presence is likely intentional. If the rest of the codebase consistently includes `serialVersionUID` in similar classes, it would be appropriate to keep it. 

The empty line between the package declaration and the `serialVersionUID` might be a stylistic choice, but since the conflict marker indicates that one side has this line and the other does not, the decision depends on the team's coding conventions.

Here is the snippet with the conflict resolved by keeping the `serialVersionUID` as it is more likely to be intentional:

```java
   * Represents the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/video-status/">Video Status Graph
   * API type</a>.
   */
  public static class VideoStatus extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * Status of a video.
     * 
     * Either "ready" (uploaded, encoded, thumbnails extracted), "processing" (not ready yet) or "error" (processing
     * failed).
```

This preserves the `serialVersionUID` and maintains the structure of the class.
