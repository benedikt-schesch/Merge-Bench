The code snippet shows a merge conflict in a Java file where two different conditions are checked before adding a version request to a network packet. The original condition includes both a check for an unknown server version and whether the payload is not a version request. The new condition only checks whether the payload is not a version request.

After considering the intent of both sides, the conflict can be resolved by choosing the new condition as it simplifies the logic while maintaining the core functionality of adding a version request only when necessary.

```java
            // pretty quickly. Since it's most likely going to fit in the same
            // packet we send out, it adds ~zero overhead. But don't piggyback a
            // version request if the payload is already a version request or if
            // we already know the server version.
            final ChannelBuffer buf;
            if (!isVersionRequest(payload)) {
              final ChannelBuffer version =
                client.encode(client.getProtocolVersionRequest());
              buf = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(header, payload, version);
            } else {
              buf = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(header, payload);
            }
```
