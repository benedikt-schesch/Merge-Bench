The code snippet has a conflict where two different variable types are declared for the same variable. Both declarations are for `mMenuTexture`, but one uses `BitmapTexture` (from the current local changes) and the other uses `BitmapTextureAtlas` (from the incoming changes).

Without additional context about which type is more appropriate or accurate for the system, it's unclear which declaration should be used. The `BitmapTexture` type might be intended for a basic texture resource, while the `BitmapTextureAtlas` type might be intended for a collection of textures.

Since the intent is ambiguous, I will present the same snippet with the conflict as provided:

```java
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	protected MenuScene mMenuScene;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mMenuTexture;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mMenuTexture;

	protected TextureRegion mMenuResetTextureRegion;
	protected TextureRegion mMenuQuitTextureRegion;
