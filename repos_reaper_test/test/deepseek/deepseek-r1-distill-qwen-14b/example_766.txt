The merge conflict presented involves lines where one side (left) sets `family` and `qualifiers` after an `else` block, while the other side (right) removes those lines. The left side's code may be redundant if the `else` block already handles `qualifiers` appropriately. However, without full context, the exact intent is unclear. Thus, the conflict remains unresolved.

```java
    } else {
      // No specific qualifier to delete: delete the entire family.  Not that
      // if `family == null', we'll delete and setting this is harmless.
      this.qualifiers = DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER;
    }
<<<<<<< HEAD
    this.family = family;
    this.qualifiers = qualifiers == null ? DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER : qualifiers;
