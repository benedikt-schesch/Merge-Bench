The merge conflict is purely about code formattingâ€”specifically, the placement of the `onAnimationStart` method's opening brace. Both versions function identically, but differ in style. Without additional context, it's unclear which style is preferred, so the conflict is resolved by choosing one style.

Here is the resolved code using the right side's formatting:

```java
    * Normally closes the review drawer (animation)
    */
    public void close() {
        mIsOpen = false;
        animate().setDuration(DRAWER_TOGGLE_DURATION).setInterpolator(new DecelerateInterpolator())
                .translationY(-getMeasuredHeight()).alpha(0.0f)
                .setListener(new Animator.AnimatorListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onAnimationStart(Animator animator) {
                        // Animation started
                    }

                    @Override
                    public void onAnimationEnd(Animator animator) {
                        // Animation completed
                    }
                });
    }
```

The lines before and after the conflict are formatted consistently with the chosen style, and the animation logic remains intact.
