The conflict involves different methods to refresh subcategories and adapters. Both approaches aim to update the UI but use different mechanisms that could be suitable depending on the situation.

```java
                        if (getActivity() == null) return;

                        Toast.makeText(getActivity(), getString(R.string.update_complete),
                                Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();

<<<<<<< HEAD
                        refreshSubCategories();

                        mAdapter.notifyArrayItemRangeChanged(0, mAdapter.size());
=======
                        rebuildSubCategories();

                        reloadAdapters();
>>>>>>> 308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5

                        updateRecommendations();
                    }

                    @Override
```

To resolve this, you'll need to decide whether to refresh the data or rebuild it, and whether to notify the adapter or reload it entirely.
