The code snippet contains a merge conflict where two different versions of a method declaration are present. The left side declares the method as `public abstract boolean isDistinct();`, while the right side simply declares it as `boolean isDistinct();`.

**Analysis:**
- The left side explicitly declares the method as `public abstract`, which is typical in interfaces where all methods are implicitly `public abstract`. However, explicitly specifying `public abstract` is redundant but not incorrect in some contexts.
- The right side omits the access modifiers, which might imply that the default access (package-private) is intended or that it's a concrete method in a class.

**Conclusion:**
Since the method name `isDistinct()` suggests that it's intended to be a property that needs to be implemented by subclasses (hence abstract), and assuming the code is part of an interface where `public abstract` is redundant but not harmful, the original left side (`public abstract`) is likely the intended declaration.
