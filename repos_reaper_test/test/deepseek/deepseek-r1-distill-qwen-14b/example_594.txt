The conflict is between removing the `emptyFacebookMap()` test and adding a new `emptyObject()` test with similar functionality but a more generic name. Both tests appear to verify that an object with a default `id` is serialized correctly, but the new test replaces the more specific one.

Since the intent seems to be verifying the JSON serialization of empty objects in general rather than specifically for `MapObject`, and the more generic name might be preferable, the change is likely intentional to rename and keep just the new test.

```java
    ListObject obj = new ListObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }

  @Test
  public void emptyFacebookMap() {
    MapObject obj = new MapObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }
