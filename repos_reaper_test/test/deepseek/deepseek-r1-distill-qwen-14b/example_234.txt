To resolve the merge conflict, we need to consider both changes. The end field's formatting was adjusted, and a new mTupleFactory field was added. Both are necessary: the formatting fix and the new field.

```java
 * contains the line of text.
 */
public class TextLoader implements LoadFunc{
    BufferedPositionedInputStream in;
    final private static Charset utf8 = Charset.forName("UTF8");
    long end;
    private TupleFactory mTupleFactory = TupleFactory.getInstance();

    public void bindTo(String fileName, BufferedPositionedInputStream in, long offset, long end) throws IOException {
        this.in = in;
        this.end = end;
        // Since we are not block aligned we throw away the first
```
