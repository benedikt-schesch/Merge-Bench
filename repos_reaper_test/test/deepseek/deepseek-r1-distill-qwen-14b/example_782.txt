The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict where one side adds a `MUTATE` constant to the `IsEdit` interface, while the other side (HEAD) has an empty code block in that position. The `MUTATE` constant is used with HBase 0.95+. Without clear context on which version to prioritize, the conflict is best left unresolved.

```java
  /**
   * Package-private interface to mark RPCs that are changing data in HBase.
   * @since 1.4
   */
  interface IsEdit {
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    /** RPC method name to use with HBase 0.95+.  */
    static final byte[] MUTATE = { 'M', 'u', 't', 'a', 't', 'e' };
