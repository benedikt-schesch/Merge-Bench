The merge conflict involves adjusting the condition to ensure the position is within valid bounds. The original code only checks if position is less than the list count, while the new code adds a check to ensure position is non-negative. This prevents potential issues with negative positions.

The correct resolution is to include both conditions as per the second branch, ensuring position is both non-negative and within the list's bounds.

```java
	@Override
	protected User getContextItemUser(int position) {
		// position = position - 1;
		Log.d(TAG, "list position:" + position);
		// 加入footer跳过footer
<<<<<<< HEAD
		if (position < mUserListAdapter.getCount()) {
=======
		if (position >=0 && position < mUserListAdapter.getCount()) {
>>>>>>> 5f1eecd58485bc3b7c0bc8e0b479d0b40f344b

			User item = (User) mUserListAdapter.getItem(position);
			if (item == null) {
				return null;
			} else {

```
