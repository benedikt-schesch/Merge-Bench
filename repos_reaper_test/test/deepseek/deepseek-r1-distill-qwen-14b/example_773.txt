The conflict in the Javadoc comments is about whether to include a note about needing to call `setFamily()`. One side keeps the existing note about qualifiers without a family having no effect, while the other adds a note explicitly telling users to call `setFamily()`.

Both changes are related but slightly different in emphasis. The original note is a warning about the effect of not setting the family, while the new note is more directive. Since they are not technically conflicting but rather补充 each other, they can be merged to provide clearer documentation.

Here's the resolved snippet with both notes included:

```java
  /**
   * Specifies a particular column qualifier to scan.
   * <p>
   * Note that specifying a qualifier without a family has no effect.
   * Note that you need to call {@link #setFamily(byte[])} too.
   * @param qualifier The column qualifier.
   * <strong>This byte array will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @throws IllegalStateException if scanning already started.
   */
  public void setQualifier(final byte[] qualifier) {
```
