The conflict is about the indentation of the initial `hash` assignment. Both sides assign `7` but differ in spacing. Since the right side adds indentation, which likely aligns with the method's style, I'll choose it.

```java
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        int hash = 7;
        if (pkgr.getKeyTuple())
        {
            hash = hash * 31 + pkgr.getKeyAsTuple().hashCode();
        }
        else
```
