The code snippet shows a merge conflict where one side includes the `serialVersionUID` declaration while the other does not. Given the ambiguity in intent, the conflict is preserved.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0

  public static class PageRestaurantSpecialties extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
