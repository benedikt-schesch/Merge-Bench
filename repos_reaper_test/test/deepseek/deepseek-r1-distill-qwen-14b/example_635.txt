The provided code snippet shows a merge conflict in a Java class where one side includes a `serialVersionUID` declaration and the other does not. The left side (HEAD) includes the field, while the right side is empty. 

Considering Java best practices, `serialVersionUID` is essential for serialVersionUID compatibility during deserialization. Therefore, it's appropriate to keep the `serialVersionUID` line from the left side.

Here is the resolved code with the conflict resolved:

```java
   * 
   * @author <a href="http://restfb.com">Norbert Bartels</a>
   */
  public static class UserDevice extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String hardware;


```
