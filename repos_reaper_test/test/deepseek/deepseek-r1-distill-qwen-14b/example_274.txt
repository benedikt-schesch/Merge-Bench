The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict. The conflict is between two versions of a Java code segment. The left side (HEAD) shows a log statement, while the right side (from commit 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a) adds a line to a map and modifies the log message. The context around the conflict is about re-writing a package in the Pig Latin compiler.

The intent on the left side is to log a message about rewriting a package. The intent on the right side is to add a mapping to `mr.phyToMRMap` and log a slightly modified message regarding the rewrite. Both changes appear to be related to the same functionality but reflect different approaches or additional details.

Given the ambiguous intent and the potential impact of adding a map entry, I will return the snippet with the conflict preserved.

```java
            } catch (PlanException e) {
                int errCode = 2029;
                String msg = "Error rewriting join package.";
                throw new MRCompilerException(msg, errCode, PigException.BUG, e);
