The merge conflict appears to be related to code formatting. Both changes aim to clear the exceptions correctly and do not impact functionality. The difference is only in styling (multiple lines vs. single line for the exceptions). Without additional context, it's unclear which style is preferred, so preserving the conflict is appropriate.

```java
   *
   * @param user Spectator to add to this game.
   * @throws TooManySpectatorsException Thrown if this game is at its maximum spectator capacity.
   * @throws IllegalStateException      Thrown if {@code user} is already in a game.
