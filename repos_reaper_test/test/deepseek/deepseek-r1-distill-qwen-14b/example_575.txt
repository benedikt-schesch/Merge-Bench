The code seems to be deciding how to convert a `rawValue` into a string. The conflict arises between using the helper method `jsonHelper.getStringFrom()` versus the direct `toString()` method. 

Considering the rest of the code where `jsonHelper` methods are used for other types (like integers), it's consistent and likely more reliable to use the helper. Using `toString()` might not handle all cases properly, especially since the warning mentions unexpected results.

```java
       * This is useful if, for example, you've got a @Facebook-annotated string field that you'd like to have a numeric
       * type shoved into.
       *
       * User beware: this will turn *anything* into a string, which might lead to results you don't expect.

    }

    if (Integer.class.equals(type) || Integer.TYPE.equals(type)) {
      return jsonHelper.getIntegerFrom(rawValue);
    }
```

The merge conflict remains because both sides have merit. Using the helper method (`jsonHelper.getStringFrom()`) maintains consistency with other type handling but might introduce unexpected behavior. The direct `toString()` approach is simpler but might not handle cases as expected. If the helper is more reliable, it's better to keep it; otherwise, the direct method is straightforward.
