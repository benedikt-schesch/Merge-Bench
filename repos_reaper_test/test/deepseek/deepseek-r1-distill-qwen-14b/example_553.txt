The merge conflict in the Javadoc comment appears to be a minor stylistic difference, with the right side adding a period for grammatical completeness. Both versions convey the same intent, but the right side is more polished. 

```java
    /**
     * Returns the given string if it is non-null; the empty string otherwise.
     * 
     * @param string
     *            the string to test and possibly return
     * @return {@code string} itself if it is non-null; {@code ""} if it is
     *         null.
     */
    public static String nullToEmpty(String string) {
        return (string == null) ? "" : string;
    }
```

The conflict is resolved by adopting the right side's change, adding the period in the `@return` comment for consistency and clarity.
