The conflict involves adding a line to initialize a PigServer instance. Both sides' intents might be related to setting up the test environment. Including the line ensures proper initialization, which is likely necessary for the test's functionality.

```java
        assertEquals(expectedCount, count);
    }

    @Test
    public void testStringLte() throws Throwable {
<<<<<<< HEAD

        PigServer pig = new PigServer(initString);

        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
        PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(tmpFile));
        int expectedCount = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < LOOP_COUNT; i++) {
            if(i % 5 == 0) {
