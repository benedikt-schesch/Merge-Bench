The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two branches. The conflict occurs in the import statements section of the file. Let's analyze the imports:

- The `<<<<<<< HEAD` side shows no additional import statement beyond the existing imports.
- The `>>>>>>> 77ca2cb827b0a0b10f18d609fa5fd707c62376f7` side shows an additional import: `import org.jboss.netty.channel.group.ChannelGroup;`

### Key Observations:
1. The `org.jboss.netty.channel.group.ChannelGroup` import is only present in one version of the file.
2. Without additional context about how `ChannelGroup` is used in the rest of the file or project, it's unclear whether this import is necessary.
3. The conflict could indicate a disagreement about whether `ChannelGroup` should be included in the imports for this file.

### Recommendations:
1. If `ChannelGroup` is actually used in the file (which is not visible in the provided snippet), then the import should be kept as it is required for the functionality of the code.
2. If `ChannelGroup` is not used, or if its functionality is already covered by other imports, then it could be safely removed.

Since we cannot see the full context of the file or how `ChannelGroup` is used, the conflict should be preserved and the decision deferred to someone with more context.
