The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict where the `verifyWorkspace()` method is present in one branch but missing in the other. Here's the conflict with the full context:

```java
	void inContext() {
		workspace = mock(WorkspaceFacade.class);
		processor = new ClassFileChangeProcessor(workspace);
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	@AfterEach
	void verifyWorkspace() {
		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586
	@Test
	void shouldNotRespondToPreBuildEvents() {
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, PRE_BUILD, AUTO_BUILD, null);
		assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event));
	}
```

To resolve this conflict, consider the following:

1. **Maintain test integrity**: The `verifyWorkspace()` method ensures no unwanted interactions with the mock `workspace` occur after each test, which is important for maintaining clean test cases.
2. **Resolve the conflict**: Keep the `@AfterEach` method from the original branch (HEAD) as it provides necessary test cleanup and verification.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
	void inContext() {
		workspace = mock(WorkspaceFacade.class);
		processor = new ClassFileChangeProcessor(workspace);
	}

	@AfterEach
	void verifyWorkspace() {
		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

	@Test
	void shouldNotRespondToPreBuildEvents() {
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, PRE_BUILD, AUTO_BUILD, null);
		assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event));
	}
```
