The merge conflict appears to stem from differing variable names and assertion approaches. The HEAD version correctly uses `responseException`, while the other side incorrectly uses `ge`. The test's intent is to validate the exception's message starts with "200". 

Since `ge` isn't defined, the HEAD's assertions are correct. Thus, we'll resolve the conflict by keeping the HEAD changes.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));
  }

  public void testFrom_withDetails() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport();
    HttpRequest request =
