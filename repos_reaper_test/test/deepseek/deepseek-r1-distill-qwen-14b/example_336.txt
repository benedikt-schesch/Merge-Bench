The code snippet provided contains a merge conflict in the `onCreateOptionsMenu` method of a Java class. The conflict occurs between the local side (HEAD) and the remote side (commit `ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62`). Both sides attempt to add a `MenuItem` for direct messages but the exact changes differ.

After reviewing the code and context, the intent appears to be adding two menu items: one for replies and another for direct messages. However, the conflict indicates that the changes in each branch may differ in how these menu items are implemented, such as their IDs, strings, or icons.

Since the exact nature of the conflict isn't entirely clear from the provided snippet and to preserve both intents, the merge conflict remains unresolved.

Here is the entire snippet including context and the conflict:

```java
	}

	// Menu.
	@Override
	public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		MenuItem item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_REPLIES, 0,
		        R.string.page_title_mentions);
		item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_revert);

		item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_DM, 0, R.string.page_title_direct_messages);
		item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_send);
