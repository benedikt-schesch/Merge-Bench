The conflict appears to be the addition of an `@Override` annotation and the `skip` method itself in one branch versus the other. The `read` method remains the same in both branches.

The `skip` method is a standard method in InputStream implementations, so it should be included.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
    public int read(byte b[], int off, int len) throws IOException {
        int read = in.read(b, off, len);
        pos += read;
        return read;
    }
    @Override
    public long skip(long n) throws IOException {
        long rc = in.skip(n);
        pos += rc;
        return rc;
    }
```
