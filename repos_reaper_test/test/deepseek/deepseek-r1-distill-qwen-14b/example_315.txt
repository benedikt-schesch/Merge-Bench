Here is the given code snippet with surrounding context in markdown, preserving the spacing and including the entire conflict:

```java
			ViewHolder holder = new ViewHolder();
			holder.profileImage = (ImageView) view.findViewById(R.id.profile_image);
			holder.screenName = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.screen_name);
			holder.userId = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.user_id);
			//holder.lastStatus = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.last_status);
<<<<<<< HEAD
			holder.followBtn = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.follow_btn);
=======
			holder.testBtn = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.test_btn);
>>>>>>> 66827e951a3a7f558f4174b3bd6fbe5bf3fa50d8
		
			view.setTag(holder);
		} else {
			view = convertView;
		}
```

In this conflict:
- The original code (HEAD) adds a `followBtn` to the ViewHolder
- The other branch (66827e951a3a7f558f4174b3bd6fbe5bf3fa50d8) replaces `followBtn` with `testBtn`

The conflict involves whether the button should be for "following" or "testing". Both alternatives seem to be UI elements, but their purposes differ significantly. Without additional context about the intended functionality of the button, it's unclear which side of the conflict is more appropriate.

If you have more context about whether the button should be for following users or for testing purposes, please provide additional details so I can give a more informed resolution.
