To resolve this merge conflict, we need to determine which license addition is appropriate. Both changes add a new license, but they're different types:

- **GnuLesserGeneralPublicLicense21()**: A copyleft license requiring derivative works to also be open-source.
- **CreativeCommonsAttributionNoDerivs30Unported()**: A permissive license allowing use as long as attribution is given.

**Recommendation**:
If the project prefers permissive licenses, add the Creative Commons license. Otherwise, keep the LGPL if appropriate.

Here's the resolved code with the chosen license:

```java
        sLicenses.clear();
        registerLicense(new ApacheSoftwareLicense20());
        registerLicense(new BSD3ClauseLicense());
        registerLicense(new ISCLicense());
        registerLicense(new MITLicense());
        registerLicense(new CreativeCommonsAttributionNoDerivs30Unported());
    }

    /**
     * Register an additional license.
     *
```
