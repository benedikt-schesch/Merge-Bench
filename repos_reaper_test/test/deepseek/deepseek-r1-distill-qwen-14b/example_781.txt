The conflict arises from the return type of `openScanner`. The original code returns `Deferred<Long>`, while the modified version returns `Deferred<Object>`. The method's Javadoc indicates the return type depends on the HBase version: `long` for 0.94 and before, or `Scanner.Response` for 0.95 and up.

Returning `Deferred<Object>` allows the method to handle both return types, making it compatible with all HBase versions. This change better aligns the method signature with the documented behavior.

```java
   * Package-private access point for {@link Scanner}s to open themselves.
   * @param scanner The scanner to open.
   * @return A deferred scanner ID (long) if HBase 0.94 and before, or a
   * deferred {@link Scanner.Response} if HBase 0.95 and up.
