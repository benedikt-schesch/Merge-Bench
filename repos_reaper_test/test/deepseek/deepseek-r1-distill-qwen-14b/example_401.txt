The merge conflict appears in the code where different mock objects are being created depending on the branch. One branch is adding mocks for `moduleRootManager` and `sdk`, while the other branch is adding mocks for `moduleSettings` and `runtimeEnvironment`.

Without additional context about which mocks are needed or the intent of the changes, it is unclear how to resolve the conflict. Both sets of mocks might be necessary depending on the requirements of the codebase.

Here is the snippet with the conflict as-is:

```java
		messageBus = mock(MessageBus.class);
		messageBusConnection = mock(MessageBusConnection.class);
		projectFileIndex = mock(ProjectFileIndex.class);
		projectRootManager = mock(ProjectRootManager.class);
		launcher = mock(InfinitestLauncher.class);
<<<<<<< HEAD
		moduleRootManager = mock(ModuleRootManager.class);
		sdk = mock(Sdk.class);
=======
		moduleSettings = mock(ModuleSettings.class);
		runtimeEnvironment = mock(RuntimeEnvironment.class);
>>>>>>> 3c868cbe67875b5515d13bd8b8237e13dd2f9c32
		control = new ProjectTestControl(project);
		annotator = mock(InfinitestAnnotator.class);
		
		when(project.getComponent(ModuleManager.class)).thenReturn(moduleManager);
		when(project.getMessageBus()).thenReturn(messageBus);
```
