The code snippet shows a merge conflict where one branch contains an `else if` block that handles customization dialogs while the other branch does not. Both branches appear to be trying to handle different string-based cases in the same conditional structure.

The context suggests this is part of an event handling block, likely in an Android app given the use of `Activity` and string resources. The conflicting code is in the middle of an `else if` chain that handles different types of items.

Here's the full snippet with the conflict:

```java
                    } else {
                        VideoUtils.playVideo(new WeakReference<Activity>(getActivity()), (Video) item);
                    }
                } else if (item instanceof String && ((String) item).contains(getString(R.string.add_source))) {
                    showAddSourceDialog();
<<<<<<< HEAD
                } else if (item instanceof String && ((String) item).contains(getString(R.string.customization))) {
                    showCustomizeDialog();

                }
            }
        };
    }
```

The conflict is between:
- **HEAD**: Adding an `else if` block to handle a customization case and show a customization dialog.
- **Other branch**: Removing the customization case entirely.

To resolve this, you would need to decide whether the customization dialog case should be:
1. Kept as is (HEAD) if the customization functionality is still needed.
2. Removed (other branch) if the customization functionality is no longer required.

Without additional context about whether the customization feature is still needed, it's unclear which change is correct. If the customization feature is still intended to be supported, then keeping the `else if` block from HEAD makes sense. If it's obsolete, then removing it aligns with the other branch.

If you are unsure, it's safer to keep the customization dialog code unless there's a clear reason to remove it.
