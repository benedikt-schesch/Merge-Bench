The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two versions of a Java class. The left side defines a `CustomBlackCard` constructor with parameters `id`, `text`, `draw`, `pick`, and `watermark`. The right side defines a `CardcastBlackCard` constructor with parameters `id`, `text`, `draw`, `pick`, and `deckId`. The conflict arises because the class names and constructor parameters differ, suggesting separate implementations.

The conflict cannot be resolved without more context, as the merge combines two separate classes. Therefore, the original snippet with the conflict is preserved.

```java
  private final String text;
  private final int draw;
