To resolve this conflict, we need to determine which change better fulfills the intent of ensuring the buffer has enough readable bytes. The new code uses `ensureReadable()`, which simplifies the logic and likely handles the buffer check more effectively than the old manual index management.

```java
      try {
        HBaseRpc.checkArrayLength(buf, length);
        // Make sure we have that many bytes readable.
        // This will have to change to be able to do streaming RPCs where we
        // deserialize parts of the response as it comes off the wire.
<<<<<<< HEAD
        buf.markReaderIndex();
        buf.skipBytes(length);
        buf.resetReaderIndex();
=======
        ensureReadable(buf, length);

      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        LOG.error("WTF?  RPC #" + rpcid + ": ", e);
      }
```

The conflict is resolved by replacing the manual buffer operations with the `ensureReadable()` method, as it better encapsulates the buffer check and enhances code maintainability.
