The conflict appears to be about the duration of the sleep operation. The side with the `30_000` value (30 seconds) may have intended a longer wait, possibly for a process that requires substantial time. The side with `8_000` (8 seconds) could be optimizing for speed or addressing a specific issue where 30 seconds was too long.

Since the intent is ambiguous, it's best to present the original conflict.

            });

        mapReference.set(mapBuilder.createPersistedTo(mapFile));
        try (ExternalMapQueryContext<Integer, Integer, ?> c = mapReference.get().queryContext(KEY)) {
            c.writeLock().lock();
