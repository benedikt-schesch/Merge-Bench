The code snippet contains a merge conflict where two different approaches are trying to set up the filter file location. The left side uses a helper method `getFilterFile(environment)`, while the right side constructs the path explicitly by appending "infinitest.filters" to the working directory. The conflict is unresolved due to ambiguous intent.

```java
    {
        checkNotNull(environment, "No runtime environment is configured. Maybe because the project has no jdk.");

        runtimeEnvironment = environment;
        this.eventQueue = eventQueue;
<<<<<<< HEAD
        File filterFile = getFilterFile(environment);
        filterList = new RegexFileFilter(filterFile);
        testNGConfigurator = new TestNGConfigurator(filterFile);
=======
        String filterFileLocation = environment.getWorkingDirectory().getAbsolutePath() + File.separator
                        + "infinitest.filters";
        filterList = new RegexFileFilter(new File(filterFileLocation));
