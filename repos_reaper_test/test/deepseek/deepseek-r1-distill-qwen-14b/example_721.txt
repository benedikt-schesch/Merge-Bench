The code shows a merge conflict where one side includes a logging statement and the other does not. Based on the context and intent, the logging statement was likely removed to clean up the code. Therefore, the right side of the conflict is resolved by removing the log.

```java
                            @Override
                            public void onFinished(Void result) {
                                UiThread.getInstance().post(new Runnable() {
                                    @Override
                                    public void run() {
                                        App.bus.post(new ReloadMessagesEvent());
                                    }
                                });
                            }
```
