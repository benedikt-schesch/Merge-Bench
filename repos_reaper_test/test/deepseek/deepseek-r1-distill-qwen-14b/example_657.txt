The code snippet provided contains a merge conflict in the imports section. The `<<<<<<< HEAD` indicates the current state, while `>>>>>>> 3e88fb2d7ef95f3cb7b5e2a771a0990c4a3a4a56` shows the alternative version. The conflict is whether to include `import java.util.Map;` in the imports. Without additional context about the class's usage of `Map`, it's unclear whether the import is needed. Therefore, the conflict should remain unresolved.

```java
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.fromInputStream;
import static java.net.HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK;

import java.io.IOException;

import java.util.Map;
