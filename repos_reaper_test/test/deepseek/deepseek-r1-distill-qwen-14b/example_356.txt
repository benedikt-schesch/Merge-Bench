The merge conflict is in the class comment of `ApacheHttpTransport.java`. The `HEAD` version includes "low-level" in the description, while the other version removes it. Both changes aim to clarify the transport's purpose, but the removal of "low-level" is slightly more concise without losing meaning.

```java
import org.apache.http.params.BasicHttpParams;
import org.apache.http.params.HttpConnectionParams;
import org.apache.http.params.HttpParams;

/**
