The conflict arises in the else-if block where the code decides how to get the port's argument value. Both sides suggest different ways to call `getPortValue()`. The original code passes both the node and port, while the new change only passes the port. Considering the method's intended functionality, if the port's value can be determined without the node, the new version is appropriate. Otherwise, the original is correct. Since we need to retain functionality, the correct version depends on the method's requirements. Without more context, it's safer to prefer the version that includes the node unless it's certain that the port alone suffices.

```java
        for (Port port : inputs) {
            Object argument;
            if (argumentMap.containsKey(port)) {
                argument = argumentMap.get(port);
            } else if (port.hasValueRange()) {

            } else {
                // The port expects a list but nothing is connected. Evaluate with an empty list.
                argument = ImmutableList.of();
            }
            arguments[i] = argument;
```
