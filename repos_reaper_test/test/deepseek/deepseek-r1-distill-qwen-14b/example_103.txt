The merge conflict is a simple formatting change, adding a space after the method name for better readability. Since this is purely stylistic, I'll choose to include the space for consistency with common coding practices.

```java
  protected ShortAssert(Short actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ShortAssert.class, description);
  }

  public ShortAssert isEqualTo(short expected) {
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
```
