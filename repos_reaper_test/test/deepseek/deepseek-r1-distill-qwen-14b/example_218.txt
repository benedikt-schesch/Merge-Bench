The code shows a merge conflict where one side uses `MAPREDUCE` while the other uses `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` as the first parameter to `PigServer` constructor. The conflict appears to be about whether to use the enum-style constant `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` or the older-style `MAPREDUCE` constant. Both approaches are valid, but using the enum-style constant is generally recommended as it's more explicit and type-safe.

Since the intent appears to be to initialize the `PigServer` correctly, I'll resolve the conflict by using the newer enum-style constant.

```java
    private PigServer pig;
    
    @Before
    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
        pig = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
    }
    
    Boolean[] nullFlags = new Boolean[] { false, true };
    
    @Test
    public void testAdd() throws Throwable {
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");

The conflict has been resolved by keeping the `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` parameter which appears to be the newer, more explicit way of specifying the execution type for the PigServer constructor.
