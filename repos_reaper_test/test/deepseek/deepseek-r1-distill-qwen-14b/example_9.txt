The merge conflict shows that the disconnected() method has been removed in one branch. The left side (HEAD) shows the method calling stop(), while the right side removes it. 

Since the disconnected() method is removed, we'll resolve by keeping the deletion.

```java
			throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to add new world to the scheduler");
		}
		return world;
	}

	@Override
	public FileSystem getFileSystem() {
		return filesystem;
	}
```
