The merge conflict is due to inconsistent indentation. The right side uses four spaces, aligning with typical Java conventions, while the left uses two. Resolving by taking the right side's indentation.

```java
    public ProtocolVersionCB(final Channel chan) {
      this.chan = chan;
    }

    public Long call(final Object response) throws Exception {
      if (response instanceof VersionMismatchException) {
        if (server_version == SERVER_VERSION_UNKNWON) {
          // If we get here, it's because we tried to handshake with a server
          // running HBase 0.92 or above, but using a pre-0.92 handshake.  So
          // we know we have to handshake differently.
          server_version = SERVER_VERSION_092_OR_ABOVE;
```
