The conflict arises from two changes: adding a `serialVersionUID` on the left and introducing a new field with documentation and annotations on the right. Both can coexist. The merged code includes both changes, preserving the class's serializability and adding the payment option.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PagePaymentOptions extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * Whether the business accepts American Express as a payment option.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
```
