The merge conflict appears to involve formatting of the Javadoc comment and the presence of the `serialVersionUID`. The left side (HEAD) includes a star line which might be an incomplete Javadoc comment, while the right side removes this line, resulting in cleaner Javadoc formatting. Both sides agree on including the `serialVersionUID`.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class Engagement extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
