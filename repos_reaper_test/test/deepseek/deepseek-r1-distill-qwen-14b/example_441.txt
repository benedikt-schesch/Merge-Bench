The merge conflict arises because two different changes were made to the `focusOnField` method. The first change (`HEAD`) added a call to `setText` on `textHelper` when the field is focused. The second change introduced a new overload with an additional parameter and added `requestFocus` and scrolling logic. To resolve this, we combine the changes to include both setting the helper text and managing focus with scrolling.

```java
        securityCodeText.setOnFocusChangeListener(l);
        zipCodeText.setOnFocusChangeListener(l);
    }

    public void focusOnField(final CreditEntryFieldBase field) {
=======
        if (this.textHelper != null) {
            this.textHelper.setText(field.getHelperText());
        }
        field.requestFocus();
        if(!scrolling) {
            scrolling = true;
        }
    }

        }
    }
