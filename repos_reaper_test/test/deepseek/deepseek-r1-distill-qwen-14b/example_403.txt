The merge conflict is in the order of the parameters in the `-S` option of the `yt-dlp` command. Both sides aim to select the best video with H264 and audio with AAC, but the new version prioritizes the resolution constraint by placing `res:576` first. This ensures that videos don't exceed the specified resolution, which aligns with the comment's intent. 

The conflict is resolved by adopting the new version to enforce the resolution limit first while maintaining the codec preferences.

```java
         * Download the best video with best vcodec no better than h264 and
         * the best audio with best acodec no better than aac and
         * with neither height nor width larger than 576.
