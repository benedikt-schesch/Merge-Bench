The merge conflict appears to be due to an extra closing brace added in one branch. Both branches are trying to close the same block, but one has an extra brace which would cause a syntax error if merged as-is.

Here's how the conflict can be resolved:

1. **Identify the conflict**: The issue is the presence of two closing braces at the end of the `else` block.
2. **Determine the correct structure**: Only one closing brace is needed after the `else` block to properly close the `if-else` statement.
3. **Choose the correct version**: Since the second closing brace is unnecessary, we'll remove it.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
        if (lo instanceof LOCogroup) {
            assertTrue(((LOCogroup) lo).getRequestedParallelism() == 16);
        } else {
            fail("Error: Unexpected Parse Tree output");
        }
    }
    
    // Rest of the code
```

This resolves the syntax issue without changing the intended behavior of the code.
