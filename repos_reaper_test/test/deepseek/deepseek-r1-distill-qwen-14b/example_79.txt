The conflict is between adding `public` keyword to the method in the interface. Since interfaces in Java automatically have `public` methods, it's more concise and standard to omit it. Both changes aim to clarify the method's purpose, but the right side correctly follows Java conventions by removing the redundant `public`.

```java
   */
  public interface Localizable {
    /**
     * @return The user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     */
    String getString();
  }

  /**
   * Enums that implement this interface have two user-visible strings associated with them.
   * <p>

```
