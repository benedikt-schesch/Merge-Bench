The code has a merge conflict regarding the indentation around the `else if` block. The left side (HEAD) has no additional indentation before the `else if`, while the right side adds spaces, aligning it with surrounding code for better consistency. Since both versions are functionally identical, the right side is chosen for improved readability.

```java
        public void run() {
          writeAction(args, callbackContext);
        }
      });
      return true;
    } else if ("writeQ".equals(action)) {
        cordova.getThreadPool().execute(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                writeQAction(args, callbackContext);
            }
        });
