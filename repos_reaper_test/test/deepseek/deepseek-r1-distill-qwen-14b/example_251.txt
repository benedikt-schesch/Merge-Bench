The merge conflict here is minimal, with only a trailing space differing in a comment line. Both sides aim to document sending the first pass input location to the loader. The extra space doesn't affect functionality, so the left side (HEAD) is preferable for consistency.

                if(!pigContext.getExecType().isLocal()) {
                    fs.setWorkingDirectory(jobcontext.getWorkingDirectory());
                }
