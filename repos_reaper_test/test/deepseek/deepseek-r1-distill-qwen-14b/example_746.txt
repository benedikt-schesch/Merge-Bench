The code snippet has a merge conflict in the `notifySidebarSlideClose()` method. The conflict is purely in code formatting - one side has the line wrapped while the other side has it unwrapped. Both implementations are functionally identical. Given that this is just a matter of code style preferences, I will resolve the conflict by choosing the more readable version with the line wrapped for better readability.

Here is the merged code:

```java
        setTranslationX(finalX);
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideClose() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
        animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(
                SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
```
