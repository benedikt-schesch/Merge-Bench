To resolve the merge conflict, I analyzed the code and determined that both branches intended to declare `Session session` and add `ChannelDirectTCPIP channel`. The duplication was due to both sides having the same line. The solution is to retain the `Session session` once and include `ChannelDirectTCPIP channel`.

```java
 * things to SSH.
 */
class SSHSocketImpl extends SocketImpl {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImpl.class);
=======
    Session session;

    ChannelDirectTCPIP channel;
