The code snippet shows a merge conflict where one side is using `BitmapTexture` and the other side is using `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Based on the surrounding context, it appears that both sides are trying to create a font texture for use with a game engine's rendering system.

The `BitmapTextureAtlas` version (`>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d`) seems more likely to be correct in this context because it is specifically designed for handling font textures in many game engines, whereas `BitmapTexture` might be a more general-purpose texture class.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
	@Override
	public void onLoadResources() {
		/* Load the font we are going to use. */
		FontFactory.setAssetBasePath("font/");
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(512, 512, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
		this.mFont = FontFactory.createFromAsset(this.mFontTexture, this, "Plok.ttf", 32, true, Color.WHITE);

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mFontTexture);
		this.mEngine.getFontManager().loadFont(this.mFont);
	}
```

The conflict was resolved by choosing the `BitmapTextureAtlas` version since it is more appropriate for handling font textures in this context.
