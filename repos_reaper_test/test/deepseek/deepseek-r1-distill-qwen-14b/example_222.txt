The code snippet provided contains a commented-out test method with a merge conflict. The test method `testQueryFail44` is commented out due to an inability to include `org.apache.pig.PigServer`. The surrounding context includes Pig Latin code for building a plan.

Given the confusion and possible dependency issues, the best course of action is to preserve the existing code with the conflict and to uncomment the test if the dependency becomes available in the future.

Here is the full snippet including context:

```java
        buildPlan("b = load 'b' as (url, query, rank);");
        buildPlan("c = cogroup a by (pagerank#'nonspam', url) , b by (rank/'2', url) ;");
        buildPlan("foreach c generate group.url;");
    }
