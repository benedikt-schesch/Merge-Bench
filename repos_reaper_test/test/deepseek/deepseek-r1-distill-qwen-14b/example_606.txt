The conflict lies in the `serialVersionUID` line being present in the left version but missing in the right. The left side preserves proper serialization handling, which is beneficial for version control and deserialization.

```java

  }

  public static class MailingAddress extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    /**
     * The mailing address ID.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
```
