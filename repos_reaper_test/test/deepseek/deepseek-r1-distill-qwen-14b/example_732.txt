The code snippet shows a merge conflict where one branch has an empty line after the animation setup, and another branch adds camera unlocking code. The intent of both sides seems to be about properly setting up the camera after displaying the thumbnail.

```java
                    flinger.setImageBitmap(info.mThumbnail);
                    flinger.doAnimation();
                }
            });

        }
