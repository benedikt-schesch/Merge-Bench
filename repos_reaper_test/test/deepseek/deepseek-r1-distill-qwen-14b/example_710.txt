The code context shows a merge conflict between two branches. The left side shows the original code where `registerReceiver` is called multiple times, while the right side adds a new `fetchAll()` method just before the `getInstance()` method. 

The new `fetchAll()` method appears to be intended to fetch various collections (playlists, loved items, etc.), but its placement just before the `getInstance()` method might be semantically appropriate depending on the class structure. It could be that this new method needs to be part of the class's initialization or public API.

The conflict arises from the addition of this new method, but it doesn't affect the existing code's functionality. Without more context about the class's structure and intended workflow, it's difficult to determine if the placement is semantically correct.

Here is the full merged snippet with the conflict:

```java
                new IntentFilter(InfoSystem.INFOSYSTEM_RESULTSREPORTED));
        TomahawkApp.getContext().registerReceiver(mCollectionManagerReceiver,
                new IntentFilter(InfoSystem.INFOSYSTEM_OPLOGISEMPTIED));
        TomahawkApp.getContext().registerReceiver(mCollectionManagerReceiver,
                new IntentFilter(DatabaseHelper.PLAYLISTSDATASOURCE_RESULTSREPORTED));

    public void fetchAll() {

        fetchLovedItemsPlaylist();
        fetchStarredAlbums();
        fetchStarredArtists();
    }

    public static CollectionManager getInstance() {
        return Holder.instance;
    }
