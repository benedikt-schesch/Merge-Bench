The code snippet includes a merge conflict where a new `launchBrowser` method is being added. Both sides of the merge are attempting to resolve whether this method should be included in the codebase.

The method itself is correctly implemented and appears to serve a valid purpose for launching a web browser with a given URL. Since the intent and implementation are clear, the method should be merged.

```java
    		Log.e(TAG, e.getMessage());
    		return null;
    	}
    }
    
    static void launchBrowser(CharSequence url, Activity act) {
		Intent browser = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url.toString()));
		browser.putExtra(Browser.EXTRA_APPLICATION_ID, act.getPackageName());
		act.startActivity(browser);
    }
