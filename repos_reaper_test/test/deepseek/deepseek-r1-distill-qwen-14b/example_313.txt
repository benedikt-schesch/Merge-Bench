The conflict involves adding a new database initialization (`mDb2 = new DatabaseHelper(this);`) after an existing database (`mDb`) is already opened. Since both might not be intended to coexist, and without clear context on which to keep, the safest resolution is to remove the conflicting line to avoid potential issues.

```java
    mContext = this.getApplicationContext();
    mImageManager = new ImageManager(this);
    mApi = new Weibo();
    mDb = new TwitterDbAdapter(this);
    mDb.open();
    
    SharedPreferences preferences = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this);        
    String username = preferences.getString(Preferences.USERNAME_KEY, "");
    String password = preferences.getString(Preferences.PASSWORD_KEY, "");
```
