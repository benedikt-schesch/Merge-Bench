The merge conflict appears in the import statements, where one side includes Hamcrest static imports and BufferedReader, while the other includes BufferedWriter and other file handling classes. Resolving this requires understanding if the code still needs Hamcrest and whether the file handling methods are updated.

The resolved code removes the Hamcrest static imports and retains the necessary file handling imports from the other commit. This assumes the test no longer relies on Hamcrest and has been updated to use other assertion methods or practices.
