The code snippet shows a merge conflict where one side includes a `serialVersionUID` while the other does not. The `serialVersionUID` is important for serialized classes to maintain compatibility. Since the class extends `AbstractFacebookType`, it's possible that serialization is intended. Therefore, the line from the left side (HEAD) with the `serialVersionUID` should be kept.

```java

  }

  public static class AgeRange extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**

     * 
     * @return The lower bounds of the range for this person's age.
     */
