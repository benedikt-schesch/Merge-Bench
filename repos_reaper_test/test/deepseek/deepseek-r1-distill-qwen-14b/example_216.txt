The merge conflict is entirely about whitespace. The original code has one empty line after the loop, while the new commit adds an additional two empty lines. This is a style choice and doesn't affect functionality. If the project prefers minimal whitespace, the original should be kept; otherwise, the new lines can be retained.

```java
            Tuple t = (Tuple)it.next();
            Double first = Double.valueOf(t.get(0).toString());
            Double second = Double.valueOf(t.get(1).toString());
            assertTrue(first.compareTo(second) < 0);
        }
