The code snippet shows a merge conflict in the assignment of `this.plugin`. Both sides aim to set `this.plugin` but differ in how they retrieve it from `Spout.getPluginManager()`. The left side directly calls `getMetaPlugin()`, while the right side explicitly casts the result of `getPluginManager()` to `PluginManager` before calling `getMetaPlugin()`. The resolution depends on whether the cast is necessary, which isn't clear without additional context about `Spout.getPluginManager()`'s return type.

The conflict remains unresolved in this case, so the full snippet with the conflict is presented below:

```java
	private DateFormat dateFormat;
	private List<Widget> lines = new ArrayList<Widget>();
	private float scroll = 0;

	public DevConsole(Font font) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.plugin = Spout.getPluginManager().getMetaPlugin();
=======
		this.plugin = ((PluginManager) Spout.getPluginManager()).getMetaPlugin();
>>>>>>> 67bcb76a96f358fc131320b0611ffaa3bf3678c2
		this.font = font;
		init();
	}
	
	public void clearConsole() {

```
