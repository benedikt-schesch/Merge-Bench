The merge conflict appears to be a stylistic issue where one line has an extra space after the type cast. Both changes aim to clone the `users` list and assign it to `mUsers`, with no functional difference. The resolver should choose based on coding standards.

```java
				});
		return view;
	}

	public void refresh(ArrayList<User> users) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		mUsers = (ArrayList<User>)users.clone();
=======
		mUsers = (ArrayList<User>) users.clone();
>>>>>>> 5f1eecd58485bc3b7c0bc8e0b479d0b2d40f344b
		notifyDataSetChanged();
	}

	@Override
	public void refresh() {

```
