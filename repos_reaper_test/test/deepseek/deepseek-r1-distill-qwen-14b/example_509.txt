The conflict is between two versions of the same line where the `SpriteBatch` constructor is called with different parameters. The left side uses `this.mFaceTextureRegion` while the right side uses `this.mFaceTextureRegionAtlas`. 

The `mFaceTextureRegion` is a single texture region, while `mFaceTextureRegionAtlas` suggests a texture atlas. Since the code inside the loop uses `mFaceTextureRegion` to draw, it's likely that the left side is correct. Therefore, we'll resolve the conflict by keeping the left side.

```java

	private void drawUsingSpriteBatch(final Scene scene) {
		final int width = this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth();
		final int height = this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight();

<<<<<<< HEAD
		final SpriteBatch spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mFaceTextureRegion, SPRITE_COUNT);
=======
		// Conflict: The correct parameter depends on whether it's a texture or atlas

		spriteBatch.setBlendFunction(GL10.GL_ONE, GL10.GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
		for(int i = 0; i < SPRITE_COUNT; i++) {
			final float x = this.mRandom.nextFloat() * (CAMERA_WIDTH - 32);
			final float y = this.mRandom.nextFloat() * (CAMERA_HEIGHT - 32);
			spriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, x, y, width, height);
```
