The code snippet has a merge conflict where one side removes lines 3-6 and replaces them with an empty line. This likely indicates a change in how the PhysicalPlan is being constructed. Both branches seem to agree on initializing `demux` and `pkg`, but the conflict arises in how they're being added to the plan.

```java

    private PhysicalPlan createDemuxPlan(boolean sameKeyType, boolean isCombiner)
        throws VisitorException {
        PODemux demux = getDemux(isCombiner);
        POPackage pkg = getMultiQueryPackage(sameKeyType, isCombiner);

        PhysicalPlan pl = new PhysicalPlan();
        pl.add(pkg);
        try {
            pl.addAsLeaf(demux);
        } catch (PlanException e) {

```

Because the intent of both branches isn't entirely clear, but given that the lines being removed are essential for constructing the `PhysicalPlan`, I recommend keeping them to ensure the plan is properly initialized with `pkg` and `demux`.
