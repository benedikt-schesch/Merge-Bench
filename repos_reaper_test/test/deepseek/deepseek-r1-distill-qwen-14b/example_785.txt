The conflict is about adding a generic type to the `Deferred` variable. The change aims to enhance type safety by explicitly indicating that `Deferred` is a generic type. Since both parts of the code otherwise are similar, resolving the conflict by adding the generic type makes sense.

```java

  /** The RPC that was failed with this exception.  */
  private final HBaseRpc rpc;

  /** A deferred one can wait on before retrying the failed RPC.  */
  private final Deferred<?> deferred;

  /**
   * Constructor.
   * @param msg A message explaining why the application has to throttle.
   * @param cause The exception that requires the application to throttle
```
