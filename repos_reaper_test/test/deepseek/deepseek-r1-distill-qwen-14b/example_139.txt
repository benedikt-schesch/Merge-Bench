The code snippet contains a merge conflict where one side includes an `@Private` annotation and the other does not. The method `setBackendException` is intended for internal use, but without clear context on why the annotation was added or removed, the conflict should remain unresolved.

```java
        public int compare(JobStats o1, JobStats o2) {
            return o1.getJobId().compareTo(o2.getJobId());
        }
    }
