The conflict arises from using two different logger initialization methods. The first version uses `LogManager.getLogger(Game.class)`, which is from `java.util.logging`, while the second uses `Logger.getLogger(Game.class)`, commonly found in SLF4J-based logging. The second approach suggests switching to a SLF4J logger, so that should be used.
