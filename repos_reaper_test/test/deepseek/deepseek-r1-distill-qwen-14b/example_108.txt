The merge conflict appears to be related to the ordering of import statements, which is purely stylistic and does not affect functionality. Both sides import the same static methods but in a different order. There's no semantic difference, so either order can be chosen.

Here's the resolved snippet with the imports ordered as they appear on the right side of the conflict:

```java
 * Copyright @2010-2011 the original author or authors.

package org.fest.assertions.internal.longarrays;

import static org.fest.assertions.error.ShouldBeNullOrEmpty.shouldBeNullOrEmpty;
import static org.fest.util.LongArrayFactory.emptyArray;
import static org.fest.assertions.test.TestData.someInfo;
import static org.fest.test.TestFailures.failBecauseExpectedAssertionErrorWasNotThrown;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.verify;

import org.junit.Test;
