The code snippet includes a merge conflict in the `getImplementationVersion()` method where one side returns "3.1.12-SNAPSHOT" while the other returns "3.1.12". 

To resolve this, consider the context:
- If SNAPSHOT is needed for ongoing development, keep "3.1.12-SNAPSHOT".
- If it's a stable release, "3.1.12" is appropriate.

Since the intent is ambiguous, I'll present both options.

```java
        return "speedment";
    }

    @Override
    public String getImplementationVersion() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        return "3.1.12-SNAPSHOT";
=======
        return "3.1.12";
>>>>>>> 7b61f14a88a9c125a24ba8dc93b98a8648e4cb70
    }

    @Override
    public String getVendor() {
        return "Speedment, Inc.";
```
