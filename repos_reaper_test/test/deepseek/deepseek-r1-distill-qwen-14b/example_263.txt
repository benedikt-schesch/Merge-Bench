The code snippet has a merge conflict in the class declaration. The left side (HEAD) does not include the `implements Serializable` clause, while the right side does. Both sides aim to define the class structure, with the right side adding the `Serializable` interface for explicit serialization capability. Without additional context, it's appropriate to include the `implements Serializable` for clarity.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
import org.w3c.dom.Element;
import org.w3c.dom.Node;


public class XMLPhysicalPlanPrinter<P extends OperatorPlan<PhysicalOperator>> extends
    PhyPlanVisitor implements Serializable {

    private Document doc = null;
    private Element parent = null;

    public XMLPhysicalPlanPrinter(PhysicalPlan plan, Document doc, Element parent) {
