The code includes a merge conflict where one side has a multi-line condition for better readability, while the other side has the condition on a single line.

The conflict appears to be purely stylistic, with both sides maintaining the same functionality but differing in code formatting. The side with the multi-line condition appears to be improving readability by breaking the long condition into two lines with proper indentation.

Since there's no functional difference and the multi-line version improves readability, it's likely the preferred resolution.

Here is the original snippet with conflict:

```java
                continue;
            }

            if (widget.getY() < tested.getFinalY() + tested.getMeasuredHeight()) {
                // Don't try to go before the first if we're already it
<<<<<<< HEAD
                if (isFirst && widget.getY() + widget.getHeight() < tested.getFinalY() - tested.getHeight() / 2)
=======
                if (isFirst && widget.getY() + widget.getHeight() < tested.getFinalY()
                        - tested.getHeight() / 2)
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
                    break;

                // Move the widget in our list
                mOpenWidgets.remove(widget);
                mOpenWidgets.add(i, widget);
```
