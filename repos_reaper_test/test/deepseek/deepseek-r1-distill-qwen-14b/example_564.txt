The merge conflict occurs in the `checkInvalidJson` test method where one side includes an assertion that an exception should be thrown and the other side does not. 

The test method is annotated to expect `FacebookJsonMappingException`, which means it should throw this exception. Both changes seem to have the same intent: ensuring that invalid JSON triggers the correct exception. Including the explicit assertion clarifies the test's intent.

```java
  }

  @Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)
  public void checkInvalidJson() {
    new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST), "{", User.class);
