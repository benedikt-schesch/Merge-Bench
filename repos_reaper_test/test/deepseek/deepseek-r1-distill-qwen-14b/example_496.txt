The code snippet shows a conflict where one version declares `mBitmapTexture` and the other declares `mBitmapTextureAtlas`. Both variables are related to bitmap textures but differ in their specific classes. Without additional context about which class is more appropriate or whether both are needed, it's unclear how to resolve this. It might indicate a potential refactor from using a single texture to using a texture atlas.

Since the intent is ambiguous, I'll preserve the conflict as is:

```java
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private int mFaceIDCounter;
	private final SparseArray<Sprite> mFaces = new SparseArray<Sprite>();
```
