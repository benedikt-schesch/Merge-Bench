The merge conflict is a stylistic difference in initializing the list types. Both approaches are correct, but the diamond operator is more concise.

```java
    }
  }

  private void skipIdlePlayers() {
    killRoundTimer();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    final List<User> playersToRemove = new ArrayList<User>();
    final List<Player> playersToUpdateStatus = new ArrayList<Player>();
=======
    final List<User> playersToRemove = new ArrayList<>();
    final List<Player> playersToUpdateStatus = new ArrayList<>();

    synchronized (roundPlayers) {

      for (final Player player : roundPlayers) {
        final List<WhiteCard> cards = playedCards.getCards(player);
        if (cards == null || cards.size() < blackCard.getPick()) {
