The code snippet contains a merge conflict where the interface `ABActivityViewer` is modified to extend `TaskController` in one version but not in the other. Both changes have different intents, and without additional context, it's unclear which is correct. Therefore, the conflict remains unresolved.

```java
 * Date: 7/17/14.
 * <p/>
 * MVP的View层，UI相关，Activity需要实现该interface
 * 它会包含一个Presenter的引用，当有事件发生（比如按钮点击后），会调用Presenter层的方法
