The conflict arises because both methods are overriding the same `executePost` method with different signatures, which is not allowed in Java. The second method adds a `headers` parameter, making it more flexible. Therefore, we should keep the second method and remove the first.

```java
   */
  @Override
  public Response executePost(String url, Map<String, String> headers, String parameters, BinaryAttachment... binaryAttachments) throws IOException {
    return response;
  }
}
```
