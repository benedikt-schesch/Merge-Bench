The code snippet has a conflict between using `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`. Both classes serve similar purposes but with different performance characteristics. `StringBuffer` is thread-safe and uses synchronization, which makes it slower compared to `StringBuilder`, which is not thread-safe and is generally more efficient when the string operations are not concurrency-related. Given the context here, we are simply appending elements in a loop with no concurrency concerns. Therefore, `StringBuilder` is the better choice as it is more efficient and widely used in newer Java code.

```java
            return;

        case STRING: {
            // Gather up all the remaining arguments into a string and pass them into
            // grunt.
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            String remainders[] = opts.getRemainingArgs();
            for (int i = 0; i < remainders.length; i++) {
                if (i != 0) sb.append(' ');
                sb.append(remainders[i]);
            }

            return sb.toString();
        }
```

The change to `StringBuffer` appears to be unnecessary unless there is a specific requirement for thread safety. Since there is no evidence of concurrency in the code, `StringBuilder` is the more appropriate choice here.
