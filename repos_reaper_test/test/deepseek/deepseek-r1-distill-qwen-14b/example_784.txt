To resolve the merge conflict, we'll consider both the value change and the access modifier change. The value is reduced to 256MB, and the access modifier is changed to `static final` without `private`.

```java
   * undetected corruption of an RPC on the network, which would turn a
   * an innocuous RPC into something allocating a ton of memory.
   * The Hadoop RPC protocol doesn't do any checksumming as they probably
   * assumed that TCP checksums would be sufficient (they're not).
   */
static final long MAX_BYTE_ARRAY_MASK =
  0xFFFFFFFFF0000000L;  // => max = 256MB

  /**
   * Verifies that the given length looks like a reasonable array length.
   * This method accepts 0 as a valid length.
   * @param buf The buffer from which the length was read.
