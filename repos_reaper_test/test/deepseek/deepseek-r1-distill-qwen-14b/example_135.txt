The conflict appears to be a whitespace-only issue between two blank lines. Since there's no semantic difference in the code, both sides are effectively the same. However, to maintain consistency, I'll choose one side.

```java
        fw1.close();

        try {
           String[] args = { "-x", "local", "-c", PIG_FILE };
           PigStats stats = PigRunner.run(args, null);
           assertTrue(stats.isSuccessful());
           assertEquals( 0, stats.getReturnCode() );
        } finally {
            new File(PIG_FILE).delete();
            Util.deleteFile(cluster, OUTPUT_FILE);
```
