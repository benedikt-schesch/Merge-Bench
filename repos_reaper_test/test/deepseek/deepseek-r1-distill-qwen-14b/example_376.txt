The code snippet shows a merge conflict where one side includes an `@Beta` annotation and the other does not. The conflict is between adding the `@Beta` annotation and leaving it as is.

To resolve this, we need to determine if the method is intended to be marked as beta. If so, keep the annotation; otherwise, remove it. However, without more context, it's unclear.

Here is the snippet with the unresolved conflict:

```java
   * @param mtlsKeyStore key store for client certificate and key to establish mutual TLS
   * @param mtlsKeyStorePassword password for mtlsKeyStore parameter
   * @param keyManagerFactory key manager factory (for example {@link
   *     #getDefaultKeyManagerFactory()})
   */
