The conflict is resolved by including the new method from the right side, as it's a new addition without overlapping with existing code.

```java
                                paramFiles.size() > 0 ? paramFiles.toArray(type2) : null);
        return new BufferedReader(new StringReader(writer.toString()));
    }
}
    
private static String getVersionString() {
	String findContainingJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(Main.class);
	  try { 
		  StringBuffer buffer = new  StringBuffer();
          JarFile jar = new JarFile(findContainingJar);
