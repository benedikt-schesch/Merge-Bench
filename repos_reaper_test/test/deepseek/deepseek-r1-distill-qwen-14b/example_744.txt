The code has a merge conflict regarding the addition of braces around the `if` statement. Both changes are syntactically correct, differing only in style. Since the change with braces is more explicit and aligns with improving code readability, I will resolve the conflict by keeping the version with braces.

```java
        mTotalHeight = WIDGETS_MARGIN;

        for (int i = 0; i < mOpenWidgets.size(); i++) {
            WidgetBase.WidgetContainer widget = mOpenWidgets.get(i);

            if (widget != ignore) {
                widget.setYSmooth(mTotalHeight);
            }

            mTotalHeight += widget.getMeasuredHeight() + mSpacing;
        }
    }
```
