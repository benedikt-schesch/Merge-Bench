The merge conflict involves handling the input stream differently based on its type. The right side's change checks if the stream is a CBZip2InputStream and avoids buffering it to prevent issues, which seems correct.

```java
    long pos;
    InputStream in;
    final int bufSize = 1024;
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in, long pos) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        this.in = in;
=======
		// Don't buffer a bzip stream as it will cause problems for split
		// records.
		if (in instanceof CBZip2InputStream) this.in = in;
		else this.in = new BufferedInputStream(in, bufSize);

        this.pos = pos;
    }
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in){
        this(in,0);
    }
```
