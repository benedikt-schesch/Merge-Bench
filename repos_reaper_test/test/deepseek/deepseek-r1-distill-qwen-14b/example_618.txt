The provided code snippet includes a merge conflict where the `locales` field has a `@Facebook` annotation on one side but not on the other. Both branches have different intentions regarding the presence of this annotation. Since the intent is ambiguous, the conflict is preserved.

```java
          regions.add(mapper.toJavaObject(region, KeyedType.class));
        }
      }
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    @Facebook

    public boolean addCity(KeyedType city) {
      if (geoLocations != null) {
        return geoLocations.addCity(city);
      }
      return cities.add(city);
