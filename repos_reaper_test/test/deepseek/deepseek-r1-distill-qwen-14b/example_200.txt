The merge conflict involves adding new variables and an import statement after the `definedCommands` declaration. The right side of the conflict adds an `ArrayList` for package imports, a debug flag, and a comment about skipped paths. These additions appear intentional and related, so they should be included.

```java
    /**
     * a table mapping names to streaming commands.
     */
    private Map<String, StreamingCommand> definedCommands = 
        new HashMap<String, StreamingCommand>();
    
    private static ArrayList<String> packageImportList = new ArrayList<String>();

    public boolean debug = true;
    
    // List of paths skipped for automatic shipping
```
