The code snippet shows a merge conflict where an additional field has been added. The conflicting lines are marked with `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>>`. The intent seems to be adding a new dependency, `IProjectConfigurationManager`, but without further context, it's unclear if this should be injected or if there are initialization steps needed.

```java
	@Inject
	private BuildListenerRegistry registry;

	protected AndroidBuildService buildService;

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
	private IProjectConfigurationManager projectConfigurationManager;

>>>>>>> b782a4bb6b4349d23790909d1e67891adbaa126c
	@Override
	@SuppressWarnings("restriction")
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
	    super.setUp();
```
