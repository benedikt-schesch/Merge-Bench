The code snippet contains a merge conflict where two different changes were made to the same line. One side added the `messageResultsAPIEnable` setting, while the other side retained the `smsReportDelivery` setting. The conflict could be resolved by determining which setting is intended to be used.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
        enableBlacklist = settings.getBoolean("EnableBlacklist", false);
        enableWhitelist = settings.getBoolean("EnableWhitelist", false);
        enableLog = settings.getBoolean("EnableLog", false);
        batteryLevel = settings.getInt("BatteryLevel", 0);
        alertPhoneNumber = settings.getString("AlertPhoneNumber", "");
