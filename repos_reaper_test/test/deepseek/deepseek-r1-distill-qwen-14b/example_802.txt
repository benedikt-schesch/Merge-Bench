The conflict appears to be around the initialization of `batched_rpcs` and the following actions when it's null. The left side (HEAD) initializes `batched_rpcs` with `server_version` while the right side initializes it without arguments but adds callbacks and schedules a flush. The exactintent isn't clear, but it appears to be a decision between initializing with or without `server_version`.

```java
    MultiAction batch;
    boolean schedule_flush = false;

    synchronized (this) {
      if (batched_rpcs == null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        batched_rpcs = new MultiAction(server_version);
=======
        batched_rpcs = new MultiAction();
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
        addMultiActionCallbacks(batched_rpcs);
        schedule_flush = true;
      }
      batch = batched_rpcs;
      // Unfortunately we have to hold the monitor on `this' while we do
```
