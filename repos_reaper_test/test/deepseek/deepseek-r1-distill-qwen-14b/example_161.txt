The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two versions of an Apache License header. The original version starts with the standard Apache Software License text, while the other version includes an additional copyright line and slightly different formatting.

The original intent of both sides is to include the necessary Apache License headers. However, the changed version adds a specific copyright notice line, while the original version does not. The conflict is likely a stylistic or formatting difference.

To resolve the conflict, the standard Apache Software License header is retained, as it is the more widely used version.
