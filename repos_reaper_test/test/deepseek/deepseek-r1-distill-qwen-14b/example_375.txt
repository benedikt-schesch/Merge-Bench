To resolve this merge conflict, we need to determine the semantic intent behind the conflicting changes. The addition of `@Beta` indicates that the method is intended to be marked as beta. Since this is a valid use case for such an annotation, we'll keep it, ensuring it's correctly placed before the method declaration.

```java
   * @param certAndKey Certificate and private key input stream. The stream should contain one
   *     certificate and one unencrypted private key. If there are multiple certificates, only the
   *     first certificate will be used.
   * @return keystore for mutual TLS.
   */
  @Beta
  public static KeyStore createMtlsKeyStore(InputStream certAndKey)
      throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {
    KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance("JKS");
    keystore.load(null);
```
