The merge conflict in the `isEquals` method can be resolved by adopting the concise ternary operator approach, which is more idiomatic in Java and maintains the same functionality.

```java
    public static boolean isLeast(int[] objs, int count) {
        return null != objs && objs.length >= count;
    }

    public static boolean isEquals(Object a, Object b) {
        return (a == null) ? (b == null) : a.equals(b);
    }

    public static String trim(CharSequence charSequence) {
        return null == charSequence ? null : charSequence.toString().trim();
    }
```
