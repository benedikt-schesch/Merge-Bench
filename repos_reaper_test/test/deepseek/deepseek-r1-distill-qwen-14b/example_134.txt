The merge conflict appears to be due to whitespace differences only, specifically indentation. Both changes aim to call `setupUDFContext` in the same location, but the indentation varies. Since this is a style difference and not a functional change, we can choose one consistent indentation.

To resolve the conflict, we'll maintain the existing 4-space indentation as per the left side.

```java
                    roots = rp.getRoots().toArray(new PhysicalOperator[1]);
                    leaf = rp.getLeaves().get(0);
                }

                // Get the UDF specific context
                MapRedUtil.setupUDFContext(jConf);

            } catch (IOException ioe) {
                String msg = "Problem while configuring reduce plan.";
                throw new RuntimeException(msg, ioe);
            }
```
