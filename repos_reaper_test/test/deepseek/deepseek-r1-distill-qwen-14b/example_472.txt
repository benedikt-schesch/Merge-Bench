The conflict arises from two different ways to import the `java.util.concurrent` package. The left side (HEAD) explicitly imports three specific classes, while the right side (new change) imports the entire package using a wildcard. Both approaches are valid, but the new change intends to simplify the imports by including all classes from the package, which is acceptable if the code uses multiple concurrency-related classes. Resolving the conflict would involve choosing the preferred import style based on project conventions, with the new change opting for the wildcard import.
