The conflict appears to be a simple variable name change from `EMPTY_ARRAY` to `ZERO_ARRAY`. Both sides are trying to use the same array constant but with different names. To resolve the conflict, we can unify both sides to use `ZERO_ARRAY` since that seems to be the intended replacement.

```java
                                                  final byte[] family) {
    // Just "fault in" the first region of the table.  Not the most optimal or
    // useful thing to do but gets the job done for now.  TODO(tsuna): Improve.
    final HBaseRpc dummy;
    if (family == EMPTY_ARRAY) {
      dummy = GetRequest.exists(table, ZERO_ARRAY);
    } else {
      dummy = GetRequest.exists(table, ZERO_ARRAY, family);
    }
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    final Deferred<Object> d = (Deferred) sendRpcToRegion(dummy);
    return d;
  }
```
