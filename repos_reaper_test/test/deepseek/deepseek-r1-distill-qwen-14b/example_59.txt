The code snippet has a merge conflict regarding the initialization of a `HashMap`. Both sides initialize the map correctly, with the newer change using the diamond operator for brevity. Since both are functionally equivalent, the diamond operator is preferred.

The resolved snippet using the diamond operator is:

```java
      synchronized (roundPlayers) {
        for (final Player player : roundPlayers) {
          final List<WhiteCard> cards = playedCards.getCards(player);
          if (cards == null || cards.size() < blackCard.getPick()) {
            final Map<ReturnableData, Object> data = new HashMap<>();
            data.put(LongPollResponse.EVENT, LongPollEvent.HURRY_UP.toString());
            data.put(LongPollResponse.GAME_ID, this.id);
            final QueuedMessage q = new QueuedMessage(MessageType.GAME_EVENT, data);
            player.getUser().enqueueMessage(q);
          }
        }
      }
```
