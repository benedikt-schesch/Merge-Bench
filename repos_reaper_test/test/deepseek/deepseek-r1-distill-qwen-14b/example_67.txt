Merge Conflict Resolution:

The code intends to add a single face-down card's client data as a singleton list. The right side correctly uses `Collections.singletonList()`, which is appropriate for wrapping a single element, unlike the flawed `Arrays.asList()` approach on the left, which should take an array. 

Resolved code using the correct approach from the right side:

```java
          cardData.add(Collections.singletonList(WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()));
```

Hereâ€™s the full context with the resolved conflict:

```java
          cardData.add(getWhiteCardData(playedCards.getCards(player)));
          faceDownCards--;
        }
        // TODO make this figure out how many blank cards in each spot, for multi-play cards
        while (faceDownCards-- > 0) {
          cardData.add(Collections.singletonList(WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()));
        }
        return cardData;
      }
    }
  }
```
