The conflict arises because the left side includes a nested conditional for reading collisionRule only when the protocol version is >=1.9, whereas the right side removes this condition and reads collisionRule unconditionally when protocolVersion is >=1.8. The right side correctly reflects that collisionRule should be handled starting from 1.8, making it the appropriate resolution.

```java
            prefix = readString( buf );
            suffix = readString( buf );
            friendlyFire = buf.readByte();
            if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 )
            {
                nameTagVisibility = readString( buf );
                collisionRule = readString( buf );
                color = buf.readByte();
            }
        }
        if ( mode == 0 || mode == 3 || mode == 4 )
        {
            int len = ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 ) ? readVarInt( buf ) : buf.readShort();
