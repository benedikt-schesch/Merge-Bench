The conflict involves a stylistic choice between `assertThat` and `assertEquals` for making similar assertions in test methods. Both methods functionally achieve the same goal of checking equality but differ in syntax and readability preferences.

Here is the resolved code with the conflict resolved by using `assertEquals` as it's a more direct and straightforward approach for simple equality checks:

```java
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_withCursor() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = createCursorConnection();
    assertEquals("NzU1MjI1MjU0", connection.getAfterCursor());
    assertEquals("MTY1MTAyNjUxNg==", connection.getBeforeCursor());
  }

  private Connection<FacebookType> createCursorConnection() {
    FakeWebRequestor fakeWebRequestor = new FakeWebRequestor() {
      @Override
```
