The code snippet contains a merge conflict where two changes to the same block of code are present. On one side (HEAD), `nameTagVisibility` is written when the protocol version is at least 1.8, followed by `collisionRule` when the version is 1.9 or higher. On the other side (`80b3135a93f0e23489cc19086e31feb12ff51798`), `collisionRule` is written unconditionally after 1.8 without the 1.9 check. The conflict is ambiguous, and the merge should be resolved based on the correct Minecraft protocol specifications for these versions. Without clear context, the conflict is preserved.

```java
            writeString( prefix, buf );
            writeString( suffix, buf );
            buf.writeByte( friendlyFire );
            if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 )
            {
<<<<<<< HEAD
                writeString( nameTagVisibility, buf );
                if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_9 )
                {
                    writeString( collisionRule, buf);
                }
                buf.writeByte( color );
