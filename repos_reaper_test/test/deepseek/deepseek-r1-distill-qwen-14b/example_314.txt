The merge conflict appears in the ViewHolder class where one side defines a `followBtn` and the other defines `testBtn`. The commit message for `testBtn` suggests it was added for testing. However, `followBtn` seems more intentional for a follow feature. Both are TextViews, so the decision is based on naming intent.

```java
	private static class ViewHolder {
		public ImageView profileImage;
		public TextView screenName;
		public TextView userId;
		public TextView lastStatus;
<<<<<<< HEAD
		public TextView followBtn;
=======
		public TextView testBtn;

	}

	@Override
	public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
		View view;
```
