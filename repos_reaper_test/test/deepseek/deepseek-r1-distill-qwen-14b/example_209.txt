The code snippet shows a merge conflict where one side adds a new method `isEnabled` while the other retains the existing `log` method. Both methods are part of a class, likely related to logging and socket handling. The `log` method is being replaced, which might indicate an intention to add a new feature but could also remove existing functionality inadvertently.

The conflict arises from whether to remove the `log` method or keep it alongside the new `isEnabled` method. Without more context, it's unclear if both methods are intended to coexist or if one should replace the other.

To resolve this, consider the following options:

1. **Add `isEnabled` without removing `log`:** This preserves the existing logging functionality and allows new features to use `isEnabled` for logging control.
2. **Modify `log` to use `isEnabled`:** Adjust the `log` method to check if logging is enabled before proceeding, thus integrating the new feature into the existing method.

Given the ambiguity, the best approach is to preserve both methods unless it's confirmed that `log` can be safely removed.

```java
    public SocketImpl createSocketImpl() {
        return new SSHSocketImpl(session);
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
	public void log(int arg0, String arg1) {
		log.error(arg0 + ": " + arg1);
	}
=======
    public boolean isEnabled(int arg0) {
        // Default to not logging anything
        return false;
    }
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309

    public void log(int arg0, String arg1) {
        log.error(arg0 + ": " + arg1);
    }
```

The conflict remains unresolved due to insufficient context to determine the intended behavior.
