The conflict is over whether to include the `@Beta` annotation on the method `isMtls()`. One side adds the annotation indicating the method is experimental, while the other removes it, possibly implying it's stable.

  /**
   * Returns whether the transport is mTLS.
   *
   * @return boolean indicating if the transport is mTLS.
   */

  public boolean isMtls() {
