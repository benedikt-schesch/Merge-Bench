The conflict arises because one side returns immediately after the error call, while the other side includes additional cleanup code. To resolve this, we'll remove the return statement after the error and include the cleanup code, allowing proper handling after the error.

```java
          callbackContext.error(returnObj);
        }
        return;
      }

      RemoveCallback(characteristicUuid, connection, operationWrite);

      //If no callback, just return
      if (callbackContext == null) {
        return;
```
