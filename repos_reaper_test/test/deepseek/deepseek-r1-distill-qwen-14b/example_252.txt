The code snippet shows a merge conflict where different sets of imports are being merged. The `<<<<<<< HEAD` side includes imports related to networking (`Socket`, `SocketException`, `SocketImplFactory`, and `URL`), while the `>>>>>>> 1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81` side does not include these imports. Without additional context about the surrounding code, it's unclear whether these imports should be kept or removed.

Here's the entire snippet with the conflict:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.io.SequenceInputStream;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.SocketException;
import java.net.SocketImplFactory;
import java.net.URL;
