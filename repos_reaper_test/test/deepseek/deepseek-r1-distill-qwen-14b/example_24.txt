The merge conflict involves two import statements that are present in one branch but absent in the other. The other branch removed these imports, likely because they were unused. Removing unnecessary imports is a good practice to keep code clean.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import org.spout.nbt.StringTag;
import org.spout.nbt.stream.NBTInputStream;
import org.spout.nbt.stream.NBTOutputStream;
import org.spout.nbt.util.NBTMapper;

public class WorldFiles {

	public static final byte WORLD_VERSION = 2;
	

```

The conflicting imports were removed as they were not used in the provided context.
