The merge conflict adds a comment explaining the purpose of the lock and the condition. Since the comment doesn't affect functionality but improves understanding, it should be included. Both changes achieve the same intent, but the comment enhances clarity without altering behavior.

Here's the merged snippet:

```java
                                 final ChannelEvent event) {
      if (event instanceof MessageEvent) {
        synchronized (ctx) {
          final ChannelPipeline pipeline = ctx.getPipeline();

          // After acquiring the lock on `ctx', if we're still in the pipeline
          // it means that no message has been sent downstream yet, we're the
          // first one to attempt to send something.
          if (pipeline.get(SayHelloFirstRpc.class) == this) {
            final MessageEvent me = (MessageEvent) event;
            final ChannelBuffer payload = (ChannelBuffer) me.getMessage();
            final ChannelBuffer header = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(HELLO_HEADER);
            final RegionClient client = pipeline.get(RegionClient.class);
```
