I'll help resolve the merge conflict by combining both changes. The HEAD branch has the `execute()` method implementation, while the other branch added the `addHeader()` method. Both methods should be present in the final code.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
  public MockLowLevelHttpRequest(String url) {
    this.url = url;
  }

  @Override
  public void addHeader(String name, String value) {
    headers.put(name, value);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpResponse execute() throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpResponse();
  }
```

The conflict was resolved by:
1. Adding the `addHeader()` method from the other branch
2. Keeping the `execute()` method from HEAD
3. Ordering the methods in a logical sequence (addHeader before execute) 
4. Preserving the proper spacing and Java syntax
