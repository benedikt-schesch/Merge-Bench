The snippet you've provided appears to represent a merge conflict between two different Apache Software License headers in a code file. On one side (HEAD), there's the Apache License, Version 2.0, while on the other side (commit 1488b22c), there's the Apache License, Version 1.1.

While I can see that the licenses are similar in structure and both are from the Apache Software Foundation, they are different versions with different copyright dates and possibly different terms. Since the intent here appears to be about licensing, and both licenses are well-known open-source licenses, it's unclear which version is intended to be preserved without more context about what the merge is trying to achieve.

Given the ambiguity in intent, I will return the same snippet with the conflict markers preserved:
