To resolve this merge conflict, we need to determine whether `myKey` or `keyWritable` should be used. Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Understand the Context**: Determine where `myKey` and `keyWritable` are defined and used elsewhere in the code.
2. **Trace Variable Usage**: Follow the variables to see which one is the correct key being processed in this context.
3. **Compare Branch Histories**: Look at the commit history to see why `keyWritable` was introduced and if it's intended to replace `myKey`.
4. **Test Both Versions**: If possible, test the code with each variable to see which one works as expected without causing errors.

Without additional context, it's ambiguous which variable is correct. Therefore, the conflict remains unresolved, and you'll need to choose based on your knowledge of the codebase.

```java
        Packager pkgr = packagers.get(index);

        // check to see if we need to unwrap the key. The keys may be
        // wrapped inside a tuple by LocalRearrange operator when jobs
        // with different map key types are merged
<<<<<<< HEAD
        PigNullableWritable curKey = myKey;
        if (!sameMapKeyType && !inCombiner && isKeyWrapped.get(index)) {
            Tuple tup = (Tuple)myKey.getValueAsPigType();

                    pkgr.getKeyType());

        }
