The correct approach is to compare the values as strings since the ordering is lexicographic. Here's the resolved code:

```java
        pigServer.registerQuery("c1 = order c by value;");

        // order in lexicographic, so 12 comes before 2
        Iterator<Tuple> iter = pigServer.openIterator("b1");
        assertTrue("b1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
        assertEquals("first item in b1", iter.next().get(0), "12");
        assertTrue("b1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
        assertEquals("second item in b1", iter.next().get(0), "2");
        assertFalse("b1 is over", iter.hasNext());

        iter = pigServer.openIterator("c1");
        assertTrue("c1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
```
