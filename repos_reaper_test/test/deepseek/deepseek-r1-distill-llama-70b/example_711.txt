Here is the resolved code with the constant added:

```java

    public static final int FALSE = 0;

    public static final int TRUE = 1;

    public static final int CHUNK_SIZE = 50;

    private static class Holder {

        private static final DatabaseHelper instance = new DatabaseHelper();

    }
```

The conflict added a new constant `CHUNK_SIZE` which appears to be a configuration value. Since there was no conflicting change in the HEAD version, I've kept the new constant while maintaining the surrounding context intact.
