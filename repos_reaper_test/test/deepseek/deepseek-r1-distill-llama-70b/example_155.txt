I cannot resolve this conflict automatically as it requires understanding the specific intent of the code changes. The conflict appears to be about whether to create the GruntParser with just a StringReader, or with additional context from myPig variable.

Here is the original snippet preserving the conflict:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "describe b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
