The merge conflict arises because the debug statement was added in one branch but not the other. The debug statement appears to measure the time taken for processing as a string when in debug mode. The intent is to add debugging functionality without disrupting existing error handling or response processing.

Here's the resolved code that combines both changes by adding the debug statement before the return:

```java
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new ResponseException(e.getMessage(), e);
                }
            }
        }
        if(TwitterApplication.DEBUG){
        	DebugTimer.betweenEnd("AS STRING");
        }
        return str;
    }

    public JSONObject asJSONObject() throws ResponseException {
        try {
```
