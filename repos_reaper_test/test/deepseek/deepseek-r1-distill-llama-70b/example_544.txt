To resolve this merge conflict, I analyzed the differing sections from both sides of the merge. Upon inspection, I noticed that both versions of the code pass the exact same arguments to the `JaxRsIntrospector.getDefinition` method. 

Since there is no semantic difference between the two versions, I can safely take either version. I will choose the version from `HEAD` for consistency with the base branch.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
            System.exit(1);
        }
        Reference baseRef = endpoint != null ? new Reference(endpoint) : null;
        return JaxRsIntrospector.getDefinition(jaxrsApplication,
                applicationName, resources, baseRef,
                useSectionNamingPackageStrategy);
    }

    /**
     * Returns the value according to its index.
     * 
```
