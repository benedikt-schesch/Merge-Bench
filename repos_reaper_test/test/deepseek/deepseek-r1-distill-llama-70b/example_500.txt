The conflict is between two different types handling bitmap textures. The left side (HEAD) uses `BitmapTexture`, while the right side uses `BitmapTextureAtlas`. 

Here's the meaning of each:
- `BitmapTexture`: Represents a single bitmap texture.
- `BitmapTextureAtlas`: Represents a collection of bitmap textures, typically used for sprite sheets ortexture atlases.

Given the variable name (`mBitmapTextureAtlas` on the right) suggests an intent to use a texture atlas rather than a single texture, and texture atlases are generally preferred for managing multiple textures in games/apps, I would resolve this conflict in favor of `BitmapTextureAtlas`.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
	
	private TiledTextureRegion mBoxFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mCircleFaceTextureRegion;

	private Scene mScene;
```
