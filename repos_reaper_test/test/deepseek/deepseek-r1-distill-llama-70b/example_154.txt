Okay, so looking at this code snippet, there's a merge conflict in the Java code where the GruntParser is being instantiated. The conflict is between initializing it with just a StringReader in HEAD versus including an additional myPig parameter in the other branch.

The GruntParser likely requires both the script and the PigContext (myPig) to function correctly, especially if it's related to parsing scripts in a specific context. Since the other branch includes myPig, which is probably necessary for context-specific parsing, that's the right choice.

Here's the resolved code with myPig included:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "dump b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();

```
