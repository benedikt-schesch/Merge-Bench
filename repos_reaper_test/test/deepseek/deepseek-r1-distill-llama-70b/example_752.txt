The conflict is resolved by choosing one of the identical lines, as both achieve the same functionality. Here is the resolved code:

```java
		if(result.isLastEvent()){
			this.concludeMeasurement();		
			return true;
		}
		
		evaluator.addResult(result.getInstance(), result.getClassVotes());
		totalCount += 1;
		
		if(totalCount == 1){
			sampleStart = System.nanoTime();
			experimentStart = sampleStart;
```
