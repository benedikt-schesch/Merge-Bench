To resolve this merge conflict, we need to decide on the formatting of the method signature while preserving the semantic intent. The method's functionality remains unchanged; only the formatting differs. Based on standard Java coding practices, I will choose the version with the exceptions on a single line for conciseness.

```java
   *
   * @param user Spectator to add to this game.
   * @throws TooManySpectatorsException Thrown if this game is at its maximum spectator capacity.
   * @throws IllegalStateException      Thrown if {@code user} is already in a game.
   */
  public void addSpectator(final User user) throws TooManySpectatorsException, IllegalStateException {
    logger.info(String.format("%s joined game %d as a spectator.", user.toString(), id));
    synchronized (spectators) {
      if (spectators.size() >= options.spectatorLimit) {
        throw new TooManySpectatorsException();
      }
```
