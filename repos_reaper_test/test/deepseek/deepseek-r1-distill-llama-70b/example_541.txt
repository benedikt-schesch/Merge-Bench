The conflict is between two log message strings, "Connect failed" and "Connection failed". Both sides aim to indicate a connection failure, but the choice of wording differs.

Looking at the surrounding context, other log messages use the format "[State] [action]" (e.g., "Device isn't connected", "Device is disconnected"). "Connection failed" follows this pattern better than "Connect failed", making it more consistent with the rest of the codebase.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
  private final String logAlreadyScanning = "Scanning already in progress";
  private final String logScanStartFail = "Scan failed to start";
  private final String logNotScanning = "Not scanning";
  //Connection
  private final String logPreviouslyConnected = "Device previously connected, reconnect or close for new device";
  private final String logConnectFail = "Connection failed";
  private final String logNeverConnected = "Never connected to device";
  private final String logIsNotConnected = "Device isn't connected";
  private final String logIsNotDisconnected = "Device isn't disconnected";
  private final String logIsDisconnected = "Device is disconnected";
  private final String logNoAddress = "No device address";
```
