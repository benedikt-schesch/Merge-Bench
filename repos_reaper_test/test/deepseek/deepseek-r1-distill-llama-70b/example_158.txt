The conflict appears to be about adding a new field `private Random r;` in the HEAD branch, while the other branch has an empty line. The intent seems to be to add the `Random r` field. Here's the resolved code:

```java
    Map<OperatorKey, MapReduceOper> splitsSeen;

    NodeIdGenerator nig;

    private String scope;

    private Random r;

    private UDFFinder udfFinder;

    private CompilationMessageCollector messageCollector = null;

    private Map<PhysicalOperator,MapReduceOper> phyToMROpMap;
```
