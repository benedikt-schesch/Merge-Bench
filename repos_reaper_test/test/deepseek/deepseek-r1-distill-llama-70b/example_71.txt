Here's the context preserved with the resolved code. The conflict was resolved by choosing the simplified and more concise version from the other commit, which aligns with modern Java conventions.

```java
  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
   */
  private List<User> playersToUsers() {
    final List<User> users;
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    users = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      users.add(player.getUser());
    }
    synchronized (spectators) {
      users.addAll(spectators);
```
