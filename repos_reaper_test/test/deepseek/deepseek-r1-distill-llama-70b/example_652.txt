Here's the code snippet with the conflict resolved:

```java
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  private String order;

  @Getter
  @Setter
  private Boolean canComment;

  @Facebook("comment_order")
  private String openGraphCommentOrder;

  @Facebook("can_comment")
  private Boolean openGraphCanComment;
```

I've preserved both the original `canComment` field from the HEAD branch and the new Open Graph-related fields from the feature branch, since they appear to serve different purposes and can coexist in the code. This maintains the functionality from both branches while avoiding data loss.
