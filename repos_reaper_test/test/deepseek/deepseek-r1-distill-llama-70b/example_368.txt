I see a merge conflict between two versions of the same code snippet. The conflict is about which version number should be used for the library. Without additional context about which version is intended, I cannot resolve the conflict accurately.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
  /**
   * Current version of the Google API Client Library for Java.
   *
   * @since 1.3
   */
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public static final String VERSION = "1.3.3-alpha";
=======
  public static final String VERSION = "1.4.0-alpha";
>>>>>>> f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b

  /**
   * Line separator to use for this OS, i.e. {@code "\n"} or {@code "\r\n"}.
   */
  public static final String LINE_SEPARATOR = System.getProperty("line.separator");
```
