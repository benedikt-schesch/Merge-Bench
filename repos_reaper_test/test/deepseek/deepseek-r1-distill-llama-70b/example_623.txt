To resolve this conflict, we need to combine both the field declaration and the serialVersionUID since both are important for the class's functionality and serialization.

```java
  }

  public static class KeyedType extends NamedFacebookType {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String key;
```
