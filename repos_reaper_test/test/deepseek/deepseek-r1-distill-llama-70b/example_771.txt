Here is the resolved code snippet with both changes merged together:

```java
  /** Special value for {@link #family} when deleting a whole row.  */
  static final byte[] WHOLE_ROW = new byte[0];

  private final byte[][] qualifiers;

  /** Whether to delete the value only at the specified timestamp. */
  private boolean at_timestamp_only = false;

  /**
   * Constructor to delete an entire row.
   * <strong>These byte arrays will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @param table The table to edit.
```
