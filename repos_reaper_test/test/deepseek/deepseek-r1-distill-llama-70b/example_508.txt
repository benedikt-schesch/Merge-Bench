The conflict is between `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas`. The correct choice is `mBitmapTexture` because `SpriteBatch` expects a texture, not a texture atlas. The surrounding code suggests `mFaceTextureRegion` is used, which comes from a texture, not an atlas. Thus, the correct line is:

```java
final SpriteBatch staticSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTexture, 2);
```

```java
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
				this.draw(faceSprite2);
			}
		};
		
		final SpriteBatch staticSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTexture, 2);
		staticSpriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, -50, 0, this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth(), this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight(), 2, 2);
		staticSpriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, 50, 0, this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth(), this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight(), 45);
		staticSpriteBatch.submit();

		dynamicSpriteBatch.setPosition(centerX, centerY - 50);
```
