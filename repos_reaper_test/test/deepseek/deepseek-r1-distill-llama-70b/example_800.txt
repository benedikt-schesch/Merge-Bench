This is a merge conflict where both sides have the same logical structure but differ in indentation. The conflict appears to be purely about whitespace formatting. The圈烜ead version uses a single space for indentation while the other branch uses four spaces. 

Looking at the broader context, both versions are checking if the response is a VersionMismatchException and then checking if the server_version is UNKNOWN. Since the logical flow is identical and only the indentation differs, this is likely a benign formatting change that was made during the merge.

The intent appears to be the same: to check for a VersionMismatchException and then handle the server_version state.

Here's the resolved version with consistent indentation, taking the four-space indentation from one side:

```java
    public ProtocolVersionCB(final Channel chan) {
      this.chan = chan;
    }

    public Long call(final Object response) throws Exception {
      if (response instanceof VersionMismatchException) {
        if (server_version == SERVER_VERSION_UNKNWON) {
          // If we get here, it's because we tried to handshake with a server
          // running HBase 0.92 or above, but using a pre-0.92 handshake.  So
          // we know we have to handshake differently.
          server_version = SERVER_VERSION_092_OR_ABOVE;
```
