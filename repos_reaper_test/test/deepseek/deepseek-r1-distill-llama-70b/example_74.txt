This code snippet contains a merge conflict between two different provider implementations. The conflict is between `customDecksServiceProvider` and `cardcastServiceProvider`. Since the intent and semantics are ambiguous without additional context, I will return the snippet with the conflict preserved.

```java
  /**
   * Lock to prevent missing timer updates.
   */
  private final Object roundTimerLock = new Object();
  private final ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor globalTimer;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private final Provider<CustomCardsService> customDecksServiceProvider;
