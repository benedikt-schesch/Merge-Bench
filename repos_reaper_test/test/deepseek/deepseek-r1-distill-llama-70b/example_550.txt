The merge conflict here appears to be purely stylistic, with one version having the parameter list split across lines and the other having it on a single line. The semantic intent of both versions is identical - both define a static method that takes an `Application` and a `List<Class>` of resources as parameters.

Since there is no functional difference between the two implementations, we can resolved the conflict by accepting either version. However, to preserve the formatting style from both branches, we will present both versions with the conflict markers:

```java
        }

        return definition;
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    public static List<Class> getAllResources(Application application,
            List<Class> resources) {
=======
    public static List<Class> getAllResources(Application application, List<Class> resources) {
>>>>>>> 1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f
        List<Class> allResources = new ArrayList<>();
        if (application != null) {
            if (application.getClasses() != null) {
                allResources.addAll(application.getClasses());
            }

```
