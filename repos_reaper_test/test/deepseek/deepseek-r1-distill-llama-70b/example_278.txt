Here is the resolved code with the merge conflict addressed by including the necessary functionality:

```java
     * @param mpkg
     * @throws OptimizerException
     */
    private int addShiftedKeyInfoIndex(int initialIndex, int onePastEndIndex,
            MultiQueryPackager mpkgr) throws OptimizerException {
        List<Packager> pkgs = mpkgr.getPackagers();
        // if we have lesser pkgs than (onePastEndIndex - initialIndex)
        // its because one or more of the pkgs is a POMultiQueryPackage which
        // internally has packages.
        int numIndices = (onePastEndIndex - initialIndex);
```
