The conflict appears to be about adding a comment and initializing `ScriptState`. The intent on both sides is to ensure `ScriptState` is properly initialized but only if it hasn't been already. The resolution combines the comments to make the intent clearer.

```java
        addJarsFromProperties();
        markPredeployedJarsFromProperties();

        PigStats.start(pigContext.getExecutionEngine().instantiatePigStats());
        // ScriptState may have been initialized in Main (e.g., if started via command line)
        // In that case, we should not overwrite it
        if (ScriptState.get() == null) {
            ScriptState.start(pigContext.getExecutionEngine().instantiateScriptState());
        }
```
