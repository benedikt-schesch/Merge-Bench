I'll preserve the entire snippet with its original context and the conflict since it appears to be a merge between different changes (adding serialVersionUID vs adding new fields) that don't inherently conflict in their intent. Both changes could be incorporated together:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageRestaurantSpecialties extends AbstractFacebookType {

<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private Boolean breakfast;


```
