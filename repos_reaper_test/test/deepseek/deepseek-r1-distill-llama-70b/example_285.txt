I cannot resolve this merge conflict because the intent of making the class `public` versus package-private is ambiguous without additional context. Both versions are changing the access modifier of the class, but it's unclear whether it should be accessible outside the package or not.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
        clone.numInputs = numInputs;
        clone.pkgr = (Packager) this.pkgr.clone();
        return clone;
    }
