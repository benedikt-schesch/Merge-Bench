I cannot resolve this merge conflict because the changes between the two branches are semantically different and require Human judgment. The HEAD branch has a method `getCustomDeckIds()` that returns a `Set<Integer>`, while the other branch has a method `getCardcastDeckIds()` that returns a `Set<String>`. These are two distinct implementations that cannot be automatically merged without knowing the intent behind the changes.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
  public void updateGameSettings(final GameOptions newOptions) {
    this.options.update(newOptions);
    notifyGameOptionsChanged();
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public Set<Integer> getCustomDeckIds() {
    return customDecksIds;
=======
  public Set<String> getCardcastDeckIds() {
    return cardcastDeckIds;
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
  }
