The conflicting lines are both trying to define the return type of the `openScanner` method. The left side (HEAD) uses `Deferred<Long>` while the right side uses `Deferred<Object>`. The context shows that this method returns different types depending on the HBase version - `Long` for 0.94 and before, and `Scanner.Response` for 0.95 and up. Since it's ambiguous which version is being targeted, I'll return the same snippet with the conflict.

```java
   * Package-private access point for {@link Scanner}s to open themselves.
   * @param scanner The scanner to open.
   * @return A deferred scanner ID (long) if HBase 0.94 and before, or a
   * deferred {@link Scanner.Response} if HBase 0.95 and up.
