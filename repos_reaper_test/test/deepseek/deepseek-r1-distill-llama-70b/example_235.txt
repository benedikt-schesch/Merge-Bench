To resolve this merge conflict, I consider the semantic intent. The comment explains that the first record is discarded and another instance handles it. "Count on" fits better, indicating reliance on another instance. Thus, the code is resolved by selecting the "count" version.

```java

    public void bindTo(String fileName, BufferedPositionedInputStream in, long offset, long end) throws IOException {
        this.in = in;
        this.end = end;
        // Since we are not block aligned we throw away the first
        // record and count on a different instance to read it
        if (offset != 0)
            getNext();
    }

    public Tuple getNext() throws IOException {
```
