I cannot resolve this conflict because it's ambiguous which utility class (`IOUtil` vs `IOUtils`) is intended to be used. Both versions appear to be attempting the same operation of converting the InputStream to a byte array, but they use different utility classes to achieve this.

Here is the original conflicted snippet preserved:

```java
	 * 
	 * @param in The Resource's contents
	 * @param href The location of the resource within the epub. Example: "cover.jpg".
	 */
	public Resource(InputStream in, String href) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		this(null, IOUtil.toByteArray(in),  href, MediatypeService.determineMediaType(href));
=======
		this(null, IOUtils.toByteArray(in), href, MediatypeService.determineMediaType(href));
>>>>>>> b9ca34bdf3a3ccf8c3ec778b8fbd52db1765325b
	}

    /**
     * Creates a Resource that tries to load the data, but falls back to lazy loading.
     *
```
