I'll preserve the context and make sure not to modify the spacing. Since the conflict is about importing different classes, both of which may be needed, I'll resolve it by including both imports without duplication.

```java
import org.spout.api.material.BlockMaterial;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.model.Model;
import org.spout.api.model.animation.Animation;
import org.spout.api.model.animation.Skeleton;
import org.spout.api.plugin.Plugin;
import org.spout.api.plugin.PluginManager;
import org.spout.api.protocol.ServerNetworkSynchronizer;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Session;
```
