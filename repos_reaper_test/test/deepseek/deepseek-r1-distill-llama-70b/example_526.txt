Here's the conflict resolution. Both conditions are checking the same `maxUriLength` constraint, just with different log messages (WARNING vs INFO). The semantics seem to be about handling URIs that are too long.

I'll preserve the WARNING level since it appears more critical, and remove the duplicate condition:

```java
                        if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength){
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                            }      
                            builder.append(url);
                        } else {
