Okay, I'll analyze this merge conflict. The conflict involves differing changes to a Java class. Let's look at what each side is trying to achieve.

On one side (HEAD), there is just the closing brace of the class, while the other side (308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5) has added new getter and setter methods for a boolean property `isWatched`.

Looking at this, the intent seems to be adding the `isWatched` property with its corresponding getter and setter methods. This is a common pattern in Java for encapsulating class properties.

Here's the merged conflict resolution:

```java
    }

    public void setCreated(long created) {
        this.created = created;
    }

    public boolean isWatched() {
        return isWatched;
    }

    public void setWatched(boolean isWatched) {
        this.isWatched = isWatched;
    }
}
```

I've merged both sides by preserving the existing code and adding the new `isWatched()` getter and `setWatched()` setter methods from the other side of the merge. This maintains all functionality and follows standard JavaBean conventions.
