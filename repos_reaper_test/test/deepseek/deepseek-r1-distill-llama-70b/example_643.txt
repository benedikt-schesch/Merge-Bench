I'll preserve the conflict since both approaches are equivalent semantically - one uses Hamcrest's `assertThat` with a matcher, and the other uses JUnit's `assertEquals`. The intent in both cases is to verify the MIME type of the attachment. Here is the code with the conflict preserved:

```java
  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeStream() {
    InputStream stream = getClass().getResourceAsStream("/binary/fruits.png");
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.png", stream);
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertThat(att).hasContentType("image/png");
=======
    assertEquals("image/png", att.getContentType());
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_imagePng() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
```
