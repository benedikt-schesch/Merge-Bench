To resolve the merge conflict, I'll accept the change from the right side (ed08e37...) as it includes the additional gameOptionsProvider parameter, which is likely required by the updated Game constructor.

```java

    // remove game 1 out from under it, to make sure it'll fix itself
    gameManager.getGames().remove(1);
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
    gameManager.getGames().put(1,
            new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
                    formatProvider, falseProvide
