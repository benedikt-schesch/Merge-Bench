Here is the merged code snippet with the conflict resolved by taking both sets of changes since they appear to be adding different functionality:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;


public class CardStack extends RelativeLayout {

    public static final int DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN = 20;

    private int mStackMargin = DEFAULT_STACK_margin;
    private boolean mEnableRotation;
    private int mGravity;
    private int mColor = -1;
    private int mIndex = 0;
    private int mNumVisible = 4;
    private boolean canSwipe = true;
    private ArrayAdapter<?> mAdapter;
```
