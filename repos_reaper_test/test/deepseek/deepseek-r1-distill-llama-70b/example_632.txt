I'll preserve the conflict since without additional context about the intended use of `picture` field, it's ambiguous whether `ProfilePictureSource` or `Picture` is the correct type. Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java

  @Getter

<<<<<<< HEAD
  private ProfilePictureSource picture;

  private Picture picture;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  /**
   * Duplicate mapping for "hometown" since FB can return it differently in different situations.
   * 
   * -- GETTER -- The user's hometown.
