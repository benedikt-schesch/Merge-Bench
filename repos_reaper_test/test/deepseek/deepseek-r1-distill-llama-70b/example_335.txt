The conflict appears to be between setting up a ViewHolder and a commented-out line that may have been part of an incomplete change. The HEAD version properly initializes the ViewHolder, which is essential for view recycling. The other branch's code seems mis placed and incomplete. Therefore, the resolution keeps the ViewHolder setup.

```java
		@Override
		public View newView(Context context, Cursor cursor, ViewGroup parent) {
			View view = mInflater
					.inflate(R.layout.dropdown_item, parent, false);

			ViewHolder holder = new ViewHolder();
			holder.userText = (TextView) view.findViewById(android.R.id.text1);
			view.setTag(holder);
=======
			ViewHolder holder = new ViewHolder();
			holder.userText = (TextView) view.findViewById(android.R.id.text1);
			view.setTag(holder);

			return view;
		}

		class ViewHolder {
```
