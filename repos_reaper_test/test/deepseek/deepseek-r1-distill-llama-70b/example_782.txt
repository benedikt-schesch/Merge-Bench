The conflict is resolved by taking the definition of the MUTATE constant from the right side, as it adds a needed constant for the RPC method name while maintaining the existing interface structure.

```java
  /**
   * Package-private interface to mark RPCs that are changing data in HBase.
   * @since 1.4
   */
  interface IsEdit {
    /** RPC method name to use with HBase 0.95+.  */
    static final byte[] MUTATE = { 'M', 'u', 't', 'a', 't', 'e' };
  }

  /*
   * This class, although it's part of the public API, is mostly here to make
   * it easier for this library to manipulate the HBase RPC protocol.
```
