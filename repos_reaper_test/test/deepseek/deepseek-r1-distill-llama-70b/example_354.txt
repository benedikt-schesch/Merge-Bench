I see this merge conflict involves a test case for GoogleJsonResponseException. Let me analyze the changes:

1. The original code (HEAD) has two assertions:
   - `assertNull(responseException.getDetails())`
   - `assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage())`

2. The other branch changes this to:
   - `assertNull(ge.getDetails())`
   - `assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("403"))`

The intent seems to be:
- Both versions want to verify that there are no details in the exception
- Both want to verify the exception message starts with "403"

However, there's ambiguity:
1. Why was the variable changed from `responseException` to `ge`?
2. Was this a typo or intentional change?

Given the context, it seems more likely that `ge` might be a typo since `responseException` is a more descriptive name and `ge` isn't declared in the provided context. The intent appears to be to make the message verification more flexible by using `startsWith()` rather than an exact match.

Since the variable name change introduces ambiguity, I'll preserve the original variable name but adopt the more flexible assertion:

```java
        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));

  }

  public void testFrom_detailsErrorObject() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport("{\"error\": {\"message\": \"invalid_token\"}, \"error_description\": \"Invalid value\"}", Json.MEDIA_TYPE);
    HttpRequest request =
