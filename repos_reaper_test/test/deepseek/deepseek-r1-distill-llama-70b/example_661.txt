Here's the resolved code with the conflict addressed. Both sides added the same line, so we'll keep it once:

```java
	@Inject
	private DexService dexService;
	
	@Inject
	private AndroidBuildService buildService;

	private List<AndroidBuildListener> listeners = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<AndroidBuildListener>());

	@Override
	public Set<IProject> build(int kind, IProgressMonitor monitor) throws Exception {
```
