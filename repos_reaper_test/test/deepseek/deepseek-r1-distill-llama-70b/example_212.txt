The conflict is in the CBZip2InputStream constructor where the assignments to `retPos`, `oldPos`, and `newPos` differ between the two merge sources. The HEAD branch assigns to both `retPos` and `oldPos`, while the other branch assigns to both `retPos` and `newPos`.

Looking at the context:
- Both versions set `retPos` to the position from `zStream.tell()`
- The only difference is whether `oldPos` or `newPos` is also set
- In the surrounding code, `newPos` is initialized to -1, while there is no declaration of `oldPos`

This suggests that one side introduced `oldPos` and the other side used `newPos`. Based on the comment mentioning `newPos`, it appears the intention was to use `newPos`.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
    // and we set retPos to newPos once we have read a character from that block.
    // see getPos() for more detail
    private long retPos, newPos = -1;

    public CBZip2InputStream(SeekableInputStream zStream, int blockSize) throws IOException {
        retPos = newPos = zStream.tell();
        ll8 = null;
        tt = null;
        checkComputedCombinedCRC = blockSize == -1;
        bsSetStream(zStream);
        initialize(blockSize);
```
