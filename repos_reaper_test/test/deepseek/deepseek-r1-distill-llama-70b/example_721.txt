Here is the resolved code snippet with both the logging and the event posting combined:

```java
                            @Override
                            public void onFinished(Void result) {
                                UiThread.getInstance().post(new Runnable() {
                                    @Override
                                    public void run() {
                                        Logger.log(SmsSentReceiver.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed message deleted ");
                                        App.bus.post(new ReloadMessagesEvent());
                                    }
                                });
                            }
```

Both actions are needed - logging the message deletion and notifying the application to reload messages.
