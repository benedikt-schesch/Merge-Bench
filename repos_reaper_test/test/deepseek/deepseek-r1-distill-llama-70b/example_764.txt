Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict resolved by preserving both changes in a way that maintains their intent and functionality:

```java
                                 final ChannelEvent event) {
      if (event instanceof MessageEvent) {
        synchronized (ctx) {
          final ChannelPipeline pipeline = ctx.getPipeline();

          // After acquiring the lock on `ctx', if we're still in the pipeline
          // it means that no message has been sent downstream yet, we're the
          // first one to attempt to send something.
          if (pipeline.get(SayHelloFirstRpc.class) == this) {
            final MessageEvent me = (MessageEvent) event;
            final ChannelBuffer payload = (ChannelBuffer) me.getMessage();
            final ChannelBuffer header = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(HELLO_HEADER);
            final RegionClient client = pipeline.get(RegionClient.class);
```
