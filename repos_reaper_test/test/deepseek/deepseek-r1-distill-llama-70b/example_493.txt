To resolve this conflict, we need to determine which class better fits the intended functionality based on the context and the surrounding code.

The `BitmapTexture` class is typically used to represent a single texture, while `BitmapTextureAtlas` is used to manage multiple textures in a single file (commonly used for spritesheets or AtlasEqualTo multiple textures). 

Given the context of the code (the use of `TextureRegion` later in the code), it appears to be part of a game or graphical context where textures might be managed collectively rather than individually. The term "Atlas" in `BitmapTextureAtlas` suggests it's meant for grouping multiple textures together, which is particularly useful for game development to optimize texture loading and management.

The surrounding code context (the use of `Scene`, `Camera`, `TextureRegion`, etc.) further suggests this is part of a game engine implementation, quite possibly using a library like libGDX. In such contexts, using a `BitmapTextureAtlas` makes more sense for organizing and maintaining textures, especially when combined with `TextureRegion` for accessing specific parts of the Atlas.

Therefore, the most logical resolution would be to use `BitmapTextureAtlas` as it aligns with the typical design patterns for handling textures in game development.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
	protected Camera mCamera;

	protected Scene mMainScene;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	protected MenuScene mMenuScene;

```

This maintains the context and appears to align with the intended design pattern of using an Atlas for texture management.
