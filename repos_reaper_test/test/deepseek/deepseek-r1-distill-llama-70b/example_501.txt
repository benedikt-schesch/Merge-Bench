I cannot resolve this conflict as the intent between the two sides is ambiguous. The left side uses `BitmapTexture` while the right side uses `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Without additional context, it's unclear which type is more appropriate. Returning the snippet with the conflict:

```java

	private Rectangle mBall;
	private final SparseArray<Rectangle> mPaddleMap = new SparseArray<Rectangle>();
	private final SparseArray<ChangeableText> mScoreChangeableTextMap = new SparseArray<ChangeableText>();

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mScoreFontTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mScoreFontTexture;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private Font mScoreFont;

	private float mPaddleCenterY;

	// ===========================================================
