To resolve the merge conflict, we need to include both necessary imports since each serves a different purpose. The `Handler` is likely used for messaging between threads, and `PackageManager` is needed for handling application information. Therefore, the conflict is resolved by accepting both changes.

```java
import android.content.ComponentName;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.ServiceConnection;
import android.os.Handler;
import android.content.pm.PackageManager;
import android.os.IBinder;
import android.os.Looper;
import android.os.Message;
import android.util.Log;
```
