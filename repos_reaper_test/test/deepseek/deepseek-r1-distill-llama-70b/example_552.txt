The conflict is resolved by adding a period at the end of the @return line for consistency and proper sentence structure.

```java
     * you won't need special null-safe forms of methods like
     * {@link String#toUpperCase} either.
     * 
     * @param string
     *            a string reference to check
     * @return {@code true} if the string is null or is the empty string.
     */
    public static boolean isNullOrEmpty(String string) {
        return string == null || string.isEmpty();
    }
