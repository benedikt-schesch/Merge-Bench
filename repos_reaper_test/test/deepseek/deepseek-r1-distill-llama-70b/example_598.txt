To resolve this merge, we need to combine both changes since both are adding new functionality. The `serialVersionUID` is important for serialization, and the `catering` field with its annotations adds new functionality.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageRestaurantServices extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private Boolean catering;
```
