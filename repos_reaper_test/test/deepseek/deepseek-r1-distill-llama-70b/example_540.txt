To resolve the conflict, we combine both changes to ensure the `isAdvertising` flag is reset and `gattServer` is closed. Here's the resolved code:

```java
            if (initPeripheralCallback != null) initPeripheralCallback.sendPluginResult(pluginResult);

            break;
          case BluetoothAdapter.STATE_TURNING_OFF:
            // Reset isAdvertising when adapter is turning off
            if (isAdvertising) isAdvertising = false;

            // Make sure gattServer is not null (in case this triggers when it is null)
            if (gattServer != null) gattServer.close();
            break;
          case BluetoothAdapter.STATE_ON:

            addProperty(returnObj, keyStatus, statusEnabled);
```
