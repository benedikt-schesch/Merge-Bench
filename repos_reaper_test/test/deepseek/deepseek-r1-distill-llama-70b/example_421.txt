I'll preserve the context as-is, but I need to analyze the merge conflict between the two changes. It appears there's a disagreement about whether to call `oven.setupPaths()`.

Looking at the surrounding context and the TODO comments, it seems like both sides are trying to:

1. Initialize Orient
2. Create an Oven instance
3. Bake with the oven
4. Check and fail on errors if needed

The difference is that one side wants to call `oven.setupPaths()` while the other side does not. Since the TODO comments indicate some refactoring is needed, and `setupPaths()` might be considered bad smell, it's possible that the intent is to remove this call.

I'll remove the conflicting lines and keep the rest of the logic intact.

```java
      // TODO: Smells bad. A lot
      Orient.instance().startup();

      // TODO: At some point, reuse Oven
      Oven oven = new Oven(createConfiguration());

      oven.bake();
      if (failOnError && !oven.getErrors().isEmpty()) {
          throw new MojoFailureException("Baked with " + oven.getErrors().size() + " errors. Check output above for details!");
      }
```
