Okay, this merge conflict involves a difference in how textures are managed in AndEngine. The original code uses `BitmapTexture` while the other version uses `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Both classes handle textures but serve different purposes: `BitmapTexture` is more straightforward for single textures, while `BitmapTextureAtlas` is for managing multiple textures more efficiently, which is often used for fonts in AndEngine. However, without more context, it's uncertain which approach was intended. Therefore, it's best to leave the conflict unresolved.

Here is the unresolved code snippet:

```java

	@Override
	public void onLoadResources() {
		/* Load the font we are going to use. */
		FontFactory.setAssetBasePath("font/");
<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTexture(512, 512, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
=======
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(512, 512, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
		this.mFont = FontFactory.createFromAsset(this.mFontTexture, this, "Plok.ttf", 32, true, Color.WHITE);

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mFontTexture);
		this.mEngine.getFontManager().loadFont(this.mFont);

```
