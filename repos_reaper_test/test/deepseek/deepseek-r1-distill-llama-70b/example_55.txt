Since both the HEAD and the other branch have identical code, the conflict is non-functional. The code from either side can be chosen as they are the same. Here's the resolved code:

```java
        synchronized (options.cardSetIds) {
          cardSets = loadCardSets(session);
          blackDeck = loadBlackDeck(cardSets);
          whiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
        }
        metrics.gameStart(currentUniqueId, cardSets, options.blanksInDeck, options.playerLimit,
            options.scoreGoal, !StringUtils.isBlank(options.password));
        startNextRound();
        gameManager.broadcastGameListRefresh();
      }
      return started;
    } finally {
```

The conflict was resolved by taking the common code from both branches as they were identical.
