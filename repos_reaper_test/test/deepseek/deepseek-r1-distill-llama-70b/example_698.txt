Since the conflict is about adding a new field `mVoteTargetSpans`, and there's no semantic conflict in the surrounding context, we can resolve this by accepting the addition of the field. The field appears to be related to tracking URL spans for vote targeting, which is a reasonable extension of the existing UI state tracking.

```java
    private int mNumVisibleComments;

    // UI State
    private View mVoteTargetView = null;
    private CommentInfo mVoteTargetCommentInfo = null;
    private URLSpan[] mVoteTargetSpans = null;
    
    // ProgressDialogs with percentage bars
    private AutoResetProgressDialog mLoadingCommentsProgress;
    
    /**
```
