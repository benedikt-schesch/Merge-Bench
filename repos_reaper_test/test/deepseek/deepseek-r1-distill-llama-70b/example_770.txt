Here is the merged code snippet with the conflict resolved by combining both sides' documentation to fully capture the intent and semantics:

```java
 * All strings are assumed to use the platform's default charset.
 * <h1>A note on passing {@code timestamp}s in argument</h1>
 * Irrespective of the order in which you send RPCs, a {@code DeleteRequest}
 * that is created with a specific timestamp in argument will only delete
 * values in HBase that were previously stored with a timestamp less than
 * or equal to that of the {@code DeleteRequest} unless
 * {@link #setDeleteAtTimestampOnly} is also called, in which case only the
 * value at the specified timestamp is deleted.
 */
public final class DeleteRequest extends BatchableRpc
  implements HBaseRpc.HasTable, HBaseRpc.HasKey,
             HBaseRpc.HasFamily, HBaseRpc.HasQualifiers, HBaseRpc.IsEdit {
