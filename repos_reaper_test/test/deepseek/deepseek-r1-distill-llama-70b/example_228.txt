The conflict is resolving the initialization of `PigServer`. The key change is replacing the `MAPREDUCE` string constant with `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` enum value, which is the correct approach for type safety.

    @Before
    @Override

        pig = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
    }

    @Test
    public void testBigGroupAll() throws Throwable {
