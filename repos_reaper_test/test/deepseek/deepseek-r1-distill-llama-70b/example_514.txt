The snippet contains a merge conflict between `BitmapTexture` and `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Looking at the surrounding context, both sides want to create a texture for the font, however:

1. `BitmapTexture` is a basic implementation that just creates a texture
2. `BitmapTextureAtlas` is typically used for texture atlasing, which is a more advanced use case

Given the surrounding context:
- The font texture is being used to load a simple font
- There's no indication that this texture needs to be part of an atlas
- The resolving code should prefer the simpler implementation unless atlas functionality is specifically needed

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
		return new Engine(new EngineOptions(true, ScreenOrientation.LANDSCAPE, new RatioResolutionPolicy(CAMERA_WIDTH, CAMERA_HEIGHT), this.mCamera));
	}

	@Override
	public void onLoadResources() {
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTexture(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
		this.mFont = new Font(this.mFontTexture, Typeface.create(Typeface.DEFAULT, Typeface.BOLD), 32, true, Color.BLACK);

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mFontTexture);
		this.mEngine.getFontManager().loadFont(this.mFont);
```
