I notice this is a simple merge conflict where both sides have identical log messages, just in different git branches (indicated by the commit hashes). The intent is clearly to log that we're resetting a game due to too few players after someone left. Since both sides have exactly the same functional code, I'll preserve both sides of the conflict as they are:

```java
      // this seems terrible
      if (players.size() == 0) {
        gameManager.destroyGame(id);
      }
      if (players.size() < 3 && state != GameState.LOBBY) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        logger.info(String.format("Resetting game %d due to too few players after someone left.",
            id));
=======
        logger.info(String.format("Resetting game %d due to too few players after someone left.", id));

        resetState(true);
      } else if (wasJudge) {
        synchronized (roundTimerLock) {
          final SafeTimerTask task = new SafeTimerTask() {
            @Override
```
