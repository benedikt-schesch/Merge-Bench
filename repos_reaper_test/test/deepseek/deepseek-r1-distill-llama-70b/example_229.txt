I'll resolve this merge conflict by selecting the most meaningful temporary filename between the two versions. The version from the other commit uses `this.getName()` which includes the test method name, making the temp file more descriptive and useful for debugging, while the original version uses a generic "test" prefix.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }

    @Test
    public void testBigGroupAll() throws Throwable {
        int LOOP_COUNT = 4*1024;
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile(this.getName(), ".txt");
        PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(tmpFile));
        for(int i = 0; i < LOOP_COUNT; i++) {
            ps.println(i);
        }
        ps.close();

```
