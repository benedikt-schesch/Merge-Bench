The conflict is resolved in favor of the more specific and accurate type description:

```java
   * The user's picture, if provided.
   * 
   * To force Facebook to fill the <code>picture</code> field you have to fetch the user with the
   * <code>fields=picture</code> parameter, otherwise the picture is <code>null</code>.
   * 
   * @return the user's picture as ProfilePictureSource object
   * @since 1.6.16
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
```

The choice was made to use `ProfilePictureSource object` since it provides a more specific type description compared to the ambiguous "picture object". This maintains clarity in the documentation about the exact return type.
