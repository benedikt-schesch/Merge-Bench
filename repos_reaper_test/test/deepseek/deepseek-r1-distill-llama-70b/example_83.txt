The conflict is between using `textParts.size()` and `textParts.length()`. Since `textParts` is a `JSONArray`, which has a `length()` method rather than `size()`, the correct choice is to use `length()`. Here's the resolved code:

```java
  private CustomCardFormatHelper() {
  }

  public static String formatBlackCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // TODO this is going to need some work to look pretty.
    final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());
    for (final Object o : textParts) {
      strs.add((String) o);
    }
    final String text = StringUtils.join(strs, "____");
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml11(text);
```
