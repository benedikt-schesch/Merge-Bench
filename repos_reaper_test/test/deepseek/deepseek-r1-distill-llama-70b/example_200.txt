I'll preserve the context and spacing as provided. The conflict appears to be about an empty line, and both sides seem to have the same code context aside from that. Here's the preserved snippet:

```java
    /**
     * a table mapping names to streaming commands.
     */
    private Map<String, StreamingCommand> definedCommands = 
        new HashMap<String, StreamingCommand>();

    private static ArrayList<String> packageImportList = new ArrayList<String>();

    public boolean debug = true;
    
    // List of paths skipped for automatic shipping
```
