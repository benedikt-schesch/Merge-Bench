The merge conflict involves different JSON handling imports. The left side (HEAD) imports `Json` and `JsonValue`, while the right side imports `JsonArray` and `JsonObject`. Since both sets of imports are from the same package but differ in their specific classes, it's possible both are needed or one set replaces the other. Without more context on how these imports are used in the code, it's ambiguous which set of imports should be retained.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:
