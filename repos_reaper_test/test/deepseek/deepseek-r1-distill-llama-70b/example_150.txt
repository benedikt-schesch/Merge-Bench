The conflict involves whether to pass an additional `PigContext` parameter to the `GruntParser` constructor. The HEAD version uses a single-argument constructor, while the feature branch includes a `PigContext`, likely needed for context-specific operations in the Pig script. Since `PigContext` is typically required for resource tracking and proper script execution, the feature branch's intent is more complete.

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "illustrate b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
