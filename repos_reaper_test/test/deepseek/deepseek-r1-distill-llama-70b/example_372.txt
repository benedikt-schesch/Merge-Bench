I cannot resolve this conflict as the intent is unclear. Here is the original snippet with the conflict:

```java
  /**
   * Returns whether the transport is mTLS.
   *
   * @return boolean indicating if the transport is mTLS.
   */
<<<<<<< HEAD
  @Beta
=======
>>>>>>> 51762f221ec8ab38da03149c8012e63aec0433dc
  public boolean isMtls() {
    return false;
  }

  /**
```

The conflict is about whether to include the `@Beta` annotation. The HEAD branch has the annotation while the other branch does not. Without knowing whether the method is supposed to be marked as beta or not, I cannot resolve this ambiguity.
