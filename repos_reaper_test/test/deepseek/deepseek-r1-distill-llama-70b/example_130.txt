As a semantic merge conflict resolver, I will analyze the conflicting changes and provide the resolved version. The conflict is in the `.setUpdateStrategy()` method where two different approaches are taken to configure the job update strategy.

**Analysis:**
- The left side (HEAD version) uses `JobUpdateStrategy.queueStrategy()` with a hardcoded group size of 1
- The right side uses `setUpdateGroupSize()` with a variable `updateGroupSize`

Both approaches aim to set the group size for updates but use different methods. The right side seems to be using a more flexible approach with a variable, while the left side uses a hardcoded value.

Since the intent is to set the update group size, we can reconcile the conflict by combining both approaches. We'll use `setUpdateGroupSize()` with the `updateGroupSize` variable, as this appears to be the more maintainable solution.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
        .setInstructions(new JobUpdateInstructions()
            .setDesiredState(new InstanceTaskConfig()
                .setTask(newConfig.newBuilder())
                .setInstances(ImmutableSet.of(new Range(0, 2))))
            .setSettings(new JobUpdateSettings()
                .setUpdateGroupSize(updateGroupSize)
                .setRollbackOnFailure(true)
                .setMinWaitInInstanceRunningMs(WATCH_TIMEOUT.as(Time.MILLISECONDS).intValue())
                .setUpdateOnlyTheseInstances(ImmutableSet.of())));

    for (IInstanceTaskConfig config : configs) {
```
