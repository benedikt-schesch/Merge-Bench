To resolve this merge conflict, we need to determine the intended functionality of the `setPkgr` method. The additional lines in the other version establish necessary relationships, so they should be included.

```java
        return pkgr;
    }

    public void setPkgr(Packager pkgr) {
        this.pkgr = pkgr;
        pkgr.setParent(this);
        pkgr.setIllustrator(illustrator);
    }

    /**
     * Make a deep copy of this operator.
     * @throws CloneNotSupportedException
```

The conflict is resolved by including both `pkgr.setParent(this);` and `pkgr.setIllustrator(illustrator);` after setting `this.pkgr`. This ensures the packager is properly initialized with the correct parent and illustrator references.
