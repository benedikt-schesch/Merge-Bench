To resolve this merge conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both changes. The left side (HEAD) introduced constants related to palette visibility and vibrancy, while the right side introduced a constant for a library updated action. These appear to be unrelated features, and there's no clear overlap in functionality.

Since both sets of constants seem to be adding new functionality rather than modifying existing code, the best approach is to include both sets of constants. There's no semantic conflict between the changes, and including all constants preserves the intent of both changes.

Here's the merged code:

```java
    public static final String PREFS_USER_KEY = "user";
    public static final String PREFS_PASSWORD_KEY = "password";

    public static final String VIDEO_UPDATE_ACTION = "videoUpdateAction";
    
    public static final String PALETTE_VISIBILITY = "paletteVisibility";
    public static final String PALETTE_VIBRANCY = "paletteVibrancy";
    
    public static final String LIBRARY_UPDATED_ACTION = "libraryUpdatedAction";
}
```
