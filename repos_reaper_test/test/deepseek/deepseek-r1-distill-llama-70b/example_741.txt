This is a simple formatting conflict where both sides are attempting to achieve the same animation logic but with different code formatting styles. The left side (HEAD) has all the animator methods chained in a single line, while the right side breaks it into multiple lines for better readability. Both achieve the same result.

I'll preserve both formatting approaches as they are semantically equivalent:

```java
            }

            @Override
            public void onAnimationEnd(Animator animator) {
                // Second step: fade out and scale and slide
<<<<<<< HEAD
                animate().alpha(0.0f).scaleY(0.7f).scaleX(0.7f).translationYBy(-getHeight()*1.5f).setStartDelay(100)
                        .setDuration(FADE_OUT_DURATION_MS).setListener(new Animator.AnimatorListener() {
=======
                animate().alpha(0.0f).scaleY(0.7f).scaleX(0.7f).translationYBy(
                        -getHeight()*1.5f).setStartDelay(100).setDuration(
                        FADE_OUT_DURATION_MS).setListener(
                        new Animator.AnimatorListener() {
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
                    @Override
                    public void onAnimationStart(Animator animator) {
```
