I'll present the code snippet with the conflict since the intent is ambiguous. Here's the snippet:

```java
    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getComments());
    Comments comments = exampleRating.getComments();
    assertEquals("chronological", comments.getOrder());
    assertEquals(1L, comments.getTotalCount().longValue());
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertTrue(comments.getCanComment());
=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getLikes());
    Likes likes = exampleRating.getLikes();
    assertEquals(0L, likes.getTotalCount().longValue());
    assertTrue(likes.getCanLike());
```

The conflict revolves around an assertion check `assertTrue(comments.getCanComment())` that is present in one branch (HEAD) but removed in the other (a17acec0). Without more context about whether `comments.getCanComment()` should be asserted or not, I've preserved the conflict.
