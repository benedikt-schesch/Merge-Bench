The conflict is between two ways of initializing a `HashMap`. The diamond operator (`<>`) version is preferred in modern Java for its brevity and readability when the type parameters can be inferred. Both versions are equivalent, so resolving to the diamond operator is acceptable.

```java
   *                        sent to people in the game.
   * @return This game's general information: ID, host, state, player list, etc.
   */
  @Nullable
  public Map<GameInfo, Object> getInfo(final boolean includePassword) {
    final Map<GameInfo, Object> info = new HashMap<>();
    info.put(GameInfo.ID, id);
    // This is probably happening because the game ceases to exist in the middle of getting the
    // game list. Just return nothing.
    if (null == host) {
      return null;
```
