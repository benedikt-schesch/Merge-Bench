I'll help resolve the merge conflict by examining the context and intentions of both sides. The conflict appears to be between an `@AfterEach` verification method and a new test method. Both are needed and should be combined.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
	void inContext() {
		workspace = mock(WorkspaceFacade.class);
		processor = new ClassFileChangeProcessor(workspace);
	}

	@AfterEach
	void verifyWorkspace() {
		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

	@Test
	void shouldNotRespondToPreBuildEvents() {
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, PRE_BUILD, AUTO_BUILD, null);
		assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event));
	}
```

The resolution combines both the `@AfterEach` verification method and the new test method, preserving the intended functionality of both changes while maintaining proper test structure.
