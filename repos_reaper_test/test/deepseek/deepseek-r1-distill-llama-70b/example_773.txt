Here is the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict addressed by combining both notes:

```java
  /**
   * Specifies a particular column qualifier to scan.
   * <p>
   * Note that specifying a qualifier without a family has no effect.
   * You need to call {@link #setFamily(byte[])} too.
   * @param qualifier The column qualifier.
   * <strong>This byte array will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @throws IllegalStateException if scanning already started.
   */
  public void setQualifier(final byte[] qualifier) {
```

The conflict was resolved by maintaining both notes since they both provide important information:
1. The original note about the effect of specifying a qualifier without a family
2. The additional note about needing to call setFamily() 

Both pieces of information are complementary and help clarify the proper usage of the method.
