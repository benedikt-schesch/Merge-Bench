The merge conflict appears to be mostly syntactic with different variable names and loop termination conditions. The intent in both cases is to traverse a tree to find an element that matches x.

Here is the resolved version:

```java
		return z;
	}

	protected T findEQ(T x) {
		Node u = r;
		while (u != null) {
			int comp = c.compare(x, u.x);
			if (comp < 0) 
				u = u.left;
			else if (comp > 0)
				u = u.right;
			else
				return u.x;
```

I resolved the conflict by:
1. Using `u != null` as the loop condition since that appears in both versions
2. Using `comp` as the comparison result variable name and keeping the rest of the logic intact
3. Maintaining the exact same indentation

The semantic intent of both versions is the same - to perform a comparison and traverse left/right in the tree based on the comparison result.
