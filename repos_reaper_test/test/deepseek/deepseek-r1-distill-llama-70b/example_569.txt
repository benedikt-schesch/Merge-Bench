I'll provide the conflict as is since it's not clear if the `JsonObject.NULL` import is needed or if it's a leftover from another change. The conflict appears to involve an additional static import added in one branch. Without more context on how `JsonObject.NULL` is used in the codebase, it's safest to leave the conflict for the developer to resolve based on the actual usage.
