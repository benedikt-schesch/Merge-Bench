I'll resolve this merge conflict by choosing the version with braces as it's more consistent with common Java coding standards for readability and maintainability, while preserving the exact functionality.

```java
        mWidgetRenderer.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);
        mSwitchRingPad.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);
        mSavePinger.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);
        mReviewDrawer.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);

        if (mShowcaseView != null) {
            mShowcaseView.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);
        }
    }

    public void updateCapabilities() {
        // Populate the sidebar buttons a little later (so we have camera parameters)
        mHandler.post(new Runnable() {
```
