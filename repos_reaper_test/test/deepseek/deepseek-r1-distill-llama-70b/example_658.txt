To resolve the merge conflict, we need to consider the intent of both sides. The HEAD branch introduced an additional `executePost` method that accepts headers, while the other branch didn't include this change. The goal is to preserve both the original method and the new overloaded method with headers.

```java
   */
  @Override
  public Response executePost(String url, String parameters, BinaryAttachment... binaryAttachments) throws IOException {
    return response;
  }

  @Override
  public Response executePost(String url, Map<String, String> headers, String parameters, BinaryAttachment... binaryAttachments) throws IOException {
    return response;
  }
}
```
