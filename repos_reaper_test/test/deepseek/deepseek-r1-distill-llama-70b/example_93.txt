To resolve this merge conflict, we need to combine the changes from both branches. The original code includes the `ConnectedUsers` parameter, while the other branch adds the `gameChatEnabled` parameter with its annotation. We should merge these by including all parameters in the constructor.

```java
  private final ConnectedUsers users;
  private final boolean gameChatEnabled;

  @Inject
  public GameChatHandler(final GameManager gameManager, final ChatFilter chatFilter,
                         final ConnectedUsers users, @GameChatEnabled final boolean gameChatEnabled) {
    super(gameManager);
    this.chatFilter = chatFilter;
    this.users = users;
    this.gameChatEnabled = gameChatEnabled;
  }
```
