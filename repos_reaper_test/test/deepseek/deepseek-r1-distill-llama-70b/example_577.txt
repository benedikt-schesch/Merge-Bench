The merge conflict is about the way to find the last occurrence of a file extension separator. While the intent is the same (find the dot/period in the filename), one side uses `lastIndexOf(".")` and the other uses `lastIndexOf('.')`. Both achieve the same goal since `lastIndexOf` can take either a char or String parameter. I'll preserve the conflict as they are semantically equivalent.
