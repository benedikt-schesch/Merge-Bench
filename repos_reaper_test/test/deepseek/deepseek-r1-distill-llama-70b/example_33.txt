I see a merge conflict between two import statements. The left side (HEAD) includes an import for `Quaternion` while the right side has no import. Since neither side provides additional context about which import is correct, I will preserve the conflict.

```java
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Point;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Transform;
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.util.thread.annotation.SnapshotRead;
import org.spout.api.util.thread.annotation.Threadsafe;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.spout.math.imaginary.Quaternion;

/**
 * Component that gives the owner the characteristics to be a part of a Scene. <p> A Scene consists of {@link Transform}s which represent the snapshot state, the live state, and the rendering state.
 * This component can be used to manipulate the object within the scene.
