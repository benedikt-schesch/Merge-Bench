The provided snippet contains a merge conflict between two versions of the Apache Software License - version 2.0 in the HEAD branch and version 1.1 in the other branch. The conflict occurs in the license comment block.

Since the intent of including a license is to specify under which terms the software is distributed, and both versions serve this purpose but with different terms and conditions, it's best not to assume which version is intended. The conflict should remain unresolved to allow the user to decide which version to use based on the project's specific needs.
