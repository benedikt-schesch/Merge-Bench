The merge conflict appears to be ambiguous because the context and intent of the changes are not clear. One side introduces a `serialVersionUID` while the other side introduces a comment about an `actor_id` field without actually adding the field itself. Since the intent is ambiguous, I will return the snippet with the conflict intact:

```java
/**
 * Represents the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/adcreative/">AdGroup Creative type</a>.
 */
public class AdCreative extends NamedAdsObject {

<<<<<<< HEAD
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  /**
   * The actor ID (Page ID) of this creative.
   *
   * This field is available only for mobile app ads created before 2015
   *
