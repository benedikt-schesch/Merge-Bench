The merge conflict appears to be resolving a change where `getIntermed()` was updated to return `Intermediate.class.getName()` instead of `Initial.class.getName()`. Based on the context, this change makes sense since:

1. The method name `getIntermed()` suggests it should return an intermediate value
2. There is a corresponding `Intermediate` class
3. The pattern matches `getInitial()` and `getFinal()` methods which return their respective class names

Here is the resolved code:

```java
    public String getInitial() {
        return Initial.class.getName();
    }

    public String getIntermed() {
        return Intermediate.class.getName();
    }

    public String getFinal() {
        return Final.class.getName();
    }
```
