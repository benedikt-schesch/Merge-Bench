The conflict appears to be about adding an additional field `ChannelDirectTCPIP channel` alongside the existing `Session session` field. Both fields appear to be needed for SSH functionality, and there's no semantic conflict between them.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
 * things to SSH.
 */
class SSHSocketImpl extends SocketImpl {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImpl.class);

    Session session;
    ChannelDirectTCPIP channel;


```
