I see a merge conflict in the Java import statements. The left side (HEAD) has two imports:
```java
import org.spout.engine.SpoutServer;
import org.spout.engine.world.SpoutServerWorld;
```

While the right side has removed those imports. From the context, this appears to be a simple import addition/removal conflict. Without more context about how these imports are used in the rest of the file, I cannot determine which side's intent should take precedence.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
import org.spout.nbt.StringTag;
import org.spout.nbt.stream.NBTInputStream;
import org.spout.nbt.stream.NBTOutputStream;
import org.spout.nbt.util.NBTMapper;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.spout.engine.SpoutServer;
import org.spout.engine.world.SpoutServerWorld;
=======
>>>>>>> 67bcb76a96f358fc131320b0611ffaa3bf3678c2

public class WorldFiles {

	public static final byte WORLD_VERSION = 2;
	
```

If you can provide more context about how these imports are used in the rest of the file, I may be able to help resolve the conflict.
