I'll help resolve this merge conflict by examining the changes from both branches and combining them semantically. The conflict appears to be adding different content at the same position in the code.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
   *
   * Represents the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/post#fields">Feed Targeting API type</a>.
   */
  public static class FeedTargeting extends Targeting {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * Maximum age.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
```
