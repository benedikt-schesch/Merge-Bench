To resolve this merge conflict, we need to ensure that both necessary imports are included. Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
import org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.HashCodeBuilder;
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.Client;
import org.spout.api.Platform;
import org.spout.api.Spout;
import org.spout.api.component.BaseComponentOwner;
import org.spout.api.component.Component;
import org.spout.api.component.entity.EntityComponent;
```

This ensures both `Vector3` and `Client` are imported.
