As per the instructions, I will return the same snippet with the conflict since the intent is ambiguous.

```java
     */
    public void attachInput(PigNullableWritable k, Iterator<NullableTuple> inp) {
        try {
            tupIter = inp;
            key = pkgr.getKey(k);
<<<<<<< HEAD

            keyWritable = k;

            inputAttached = true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "Error attaching input for key " + k +
                    " in " + name() + " at location " + getOriginalLocations(), e);
