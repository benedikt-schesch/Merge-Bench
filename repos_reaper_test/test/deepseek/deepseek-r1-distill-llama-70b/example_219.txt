Here is the resolved snippet after considering the intent of both sides of the merge:

```java

package org.apache.pig.test;

import static org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType.MAPREDUCE;
import org.apache.pig.PigServer;

import org.apache.pig.data.DataType;
import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;
```

The conflict was resolved in favor of maintaining the static import for `MAPREDUCE` since it appears to be used directly in the code, preserving the original intent while removing the redundant import of `ExecType`.
