The conflict is resolved by choosing `BitmapTextureAtlas` since the surrounding context suggests multiple textures are being used, making an atlas more appropriate.

```java

	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private Scene mScene;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mOnScreenControlTexture;
	private TextureRegion mOnScreenControlBaseTextureRegion;
	private TextureRegion mOnScreenControlKnobTextureRegion;

	private boolean mPlaceOnScreenControlsAtDifferentVerticalLocations = false;
