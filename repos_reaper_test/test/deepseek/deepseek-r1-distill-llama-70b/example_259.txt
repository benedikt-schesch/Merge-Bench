As an expert in semantic merge conflict resolution, I will analyze and resolve the conflict based on the intent of both sides.

The conflict is between importing `LitePackager` (from HEAD) versus `Packager` (from the other branch). The class names suggest they are related but have different implementations. `LitePackager` might be a lighter-weight version while `Packager` could be the standard or original version.

Since the intent is ambiguous without more context about which packager implementation is needed, I will preserve the conflict.
