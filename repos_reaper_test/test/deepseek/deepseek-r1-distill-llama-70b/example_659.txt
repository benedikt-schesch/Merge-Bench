To resolve the merge conflict, we need to combine the changes from both sides. Each side added a new field, so we include both fields in the final code.

```java
	@Inject
	private BuildListenerRegistry registry;

	protected AndroidBuildService buildService;
	private IProjectConfigurationManager projectConfigurationManager;

	@Override
	@SuppressWarnings("restriction")
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
	    super.setUp();
```
