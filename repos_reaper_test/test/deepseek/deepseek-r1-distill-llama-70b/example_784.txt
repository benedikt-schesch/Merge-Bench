Here is the code snippet with the conflict unresolved. It's best for the development team to decide the appropriate maximum buffer size based on their specific needs and security considerations.

```java
   * undetected corruption of an RPC on the network, which would turn a
   * an innocuous RPC into something allocating a ton of memory.
   * The Hadoop RPC protocol doesn't do any checksumming as they probably
   * assumed that TCP checksums would be sufficient (they're not).
