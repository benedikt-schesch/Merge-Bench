To resolve the merge conflict, we need to ensure the `rpc` object is correctly retrieved before it's used in the subsequent code. The HEAD version fetches `rpc` from `rpcs_inflight`, which is necessary for the following operations.

```java
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        LOG.error("WTF?  RPC #" + rpcid + ": ", e);
      }
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    final HBaseRpc rpc = rpcs_inflight.get(rpcid);
=======
    final HBaseRpc rpc = rpcs_inflight.get(rpcid);
>>>>>>> resolved
    if ((flags & HBaseRpc.RPC_ERROR) != 0) {
      return deserializeException(buf, rpc);
    }
    try {
```
