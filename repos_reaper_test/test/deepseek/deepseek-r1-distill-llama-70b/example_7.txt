The conflict is between importing `Channel` in HEAD and `ChannelGroup` in the other branch. Both imports are needed since they come from the same package and likely serve different purposes in the code. Therefore, we should include both imports.

```java
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.UUID;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

import org.jboss.netty.channel.Channel;
import org.jboss.netty.channel.group.ChannelGroup;
import org.spout.api.command.CommandSource;
import org.spout.api.command.CommandManager;
import org.spout.api.entity.Entity;
import org.spout.api.event.EventManager;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
```
