To resolve this merge conflict, we need to determine which version of the `USER_AGENT_SUFFIX` string better serves the intent of the codebase.

**Analysis:**
- The version in the `HEAD` branch uses `Strings.VERSION`, which suggests that the version is intended to be dynamic and reflect the current library version automatically.
- The version in the other branch is hardcoded to `"1.2.4-alpha"`, which would require manual updates with each version change.

**Decision:**
The `HEAD` version appears to be more maintainable as it uses a dynamic version value, which is less prone to being outdated or requiring manual updates. Therefore, the `HEAD` version should be preserved.
