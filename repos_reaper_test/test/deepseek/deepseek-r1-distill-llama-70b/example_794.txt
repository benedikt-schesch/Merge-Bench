To resolve the conflict, we should consider the intent of both code versions. The original code marks, skips, and resets the buffer index, while the new code uses ensureReadable() to verify the buffer length. EnsureReadable() likely encapsulates the same functionality but more cleanly. Thus, the new version is preferred for clarity and maintainability.

```java
      try {
        HBaseRpc.checkArrayLength(buf, length);
        // Make sure we have that many bytes readable.
        // This will have to change to be able to do streaming RPCs where we
        // deserialize parts of the response as it comes off the wire.
        buf.markReaderIndex();
        buf.skipBytes(length);
        buf.resetReaderIndex();
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        LOG.error("WTF?  RPC #" + rpcid + ": ", e);
      }
    }
```
