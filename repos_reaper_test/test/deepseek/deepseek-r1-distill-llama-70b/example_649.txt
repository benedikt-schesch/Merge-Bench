The conflict is in the comments between two branches where one side has a blank line with an asterisk and the other side has a repeated "Post-JSON-mapping" line. The core documentation content is the same, but there is a formatting difference. Both sides appear to want to document the method's purpose as a post-mapping operation for populating message tags. The conflict appears to be about comment formatting rather than substantive content.

```java
    createdTime = toDateFromLongFormat(rawCreatedTime);
  }

  /**
   * Post-JSON-mapping operation that populates the {@code messageTags} field "by hand".
   * 
   * @param jsonMapper
   *          The {@code JsonMapper} that was used to map to this type.
   */
  @JsonMappingCompleted
  protected void jsonMappingCompleted(JsonMapper jsonMapper) {
