The conflict appears to be purely a formatting difference in the condition statement. The logic is identical between both versions - it checks if the Y movement is more than half the height downward or if the X movement is more than half the width in either direction, while ensuring the listener is not null.

The only difference is that in the HEAD version the condition is written in a single line, while in the c923751 version it is split into two lines for better readability. I will preserve the version with better readability:

```java
        if (event.getActionMasked() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {
            mDownX = event.getRawX();
            mDownY = event.getRawY();
            mListener.onShutterButtonPressed();
        } else if (event.getActionMasked() == MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE) {
            if ((event.getRawY() - mDownY < -getHeight() / 2 || Math.abs(event.getRawX()
                    - mDownX) > getWidth() / 2) && mListener != null) {
                if (!mSlideOpen) {
                    mListener.onSlideOpen();
                    mSlideOpen = true;
                }
            } else {
