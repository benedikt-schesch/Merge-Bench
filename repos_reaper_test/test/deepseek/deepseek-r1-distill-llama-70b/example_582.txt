To resolve this merge conflict, we need to consider the intent of both code snippets. The left side (HEAD) maps the `picData` to a `ProfilePictureSource` object, while the right side extracts just the URL as a string. Assuming `picture` should be a `ProfilePictureSource`, the left side's approach is appropriate.

```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

    JsonObject picData = rawPicture.get("data").asObject();
    if (picData != null) {
      picture = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(picData.toString(), ProfilePictureSource.class);
    }
  }
}
```
