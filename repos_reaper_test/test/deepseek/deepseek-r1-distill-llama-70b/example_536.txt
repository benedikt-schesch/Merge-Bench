I'll help resolve the merge conflict by looking at the intent and semantics of both sides. The conflict is purely about code formatting and style:

- The left side (HEAD) has a space between `)` and `{`
- The right side (2efc89d) removes that space
- Both sides are checking for `"writeQ"` action and executing `writeQAction`

Here is the resolved code with the conflict removed, maintaining standard Java formatting conventions:

```java
        public void run() {
          writeAction(args, callbackContext);
        }
      });
      return true;
    } else if ("writeQ".equals(action)) {
=======
    } else if ("writeQ".equals(action)) {

      cordova.getThreadPool().execute(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
          writeQAction(args, callbackContext);
        }
      });

```
