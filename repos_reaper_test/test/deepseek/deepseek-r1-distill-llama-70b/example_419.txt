Here is the resolved code snippet. I've kept the commented out lines as they appear to be work-in-progress or commented out for debugging purposes, but resolved the merge conflict by keeping the uncommented line about getting the file's absolute path:

```java
        if (requestCode != TLOG_PICKER_REQUEST_CODE || resultCode != RESULT_OK) {
            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, returnIntent);
            return;
        }

//        //Get the file's absolute path from the incoming intent
        //Get the file's absolute path from the incoming intent
        final String tlogAbsolutePath = returnIntent.getStringExtra(ServiceDataContract.EXTRA_TLOG_ABSOLUTE_PATH);

        if (tlogOpener != null)
            tlogOpener.cancel(true);
        //
```

The resolution keeps the line uncommented as it appears to be the intended functionality to get the file path from the intent, while maintaining the rest of the code as it appears to be work in progress.
