I'll analyze the merge conflict and resolve it based on the intent of both sides.

```java
    }
    return info;
  }

  public final List<Player> getPlayers() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    final List<Player> copy = new ArrayList<Player>(players.size());
=======
    final List<Player> copy = new ArrayList<>(players.size());
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
    copy.addAll(players);
    return copy;
  }

  /**

```

The conflict shows two different ways to create an ArrayList with an initial capacity:

1. `new ArrayList<Player>(players.size())` (HEAD version)
2. `new ArrayList<>(players.size())` (merge version)

Both achieve the same goal of creating an empty ArrayList with the capacity set to the size of the players list. The only difference is the explicit type parameter specification.

Since there's no functional difference between the two implementations, and the diamond operator `(<>`) is a cleaner, more modern way of writing it in Java, I've chosen the merge version as the resolved conflict.
