The conflict arises from differing assertion styles between JUnit and Hamcrest. The resolution chooses JUnit's `assertEquals` for conciseness and alignment with JUnit 5 standards.

```java
      for (FacebookType type : page) {
        counter++;
      }
    }

    assertEquals(18, counter);
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_snapshot() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();
```
