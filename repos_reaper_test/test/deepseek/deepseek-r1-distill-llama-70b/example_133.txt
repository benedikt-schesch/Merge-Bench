The conflict is resolved by accepting the change to make `sJobConfInternal` final, as it aligns with good practice for ThreadLocal variables that shouldn't be reassigned.

```java
     * <pre>UdfContext.getUdfContext().getJobConf()</pre>
     */
    @Deprecated
    public static Configuration sJobConf = null;

    public static final ThreadLocal<Configuration> sJobConfInternal = new ThreadLocal<Configuration>();

    public static class Map extends PigMapBase {

        @Override
        public void collect(Context oc, Tuple tuple)
```
