The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict between two different files. The conflict shows two different versions of a file, each with different package declarations and import statements.

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD:src/org/apache/pig/impl/eval/StarSpec.java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Properties;
=======
package org.apache.pig.impl.plan;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309:src/org/apache/pig/impl/plan/NodeIdGenerator.java

import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class NodeIdGenerator {
```

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent of both versions:

1. **HEAD Version (`StarSpec.java`)**:
   - Package: `org.apache.pig.impl.eval`
   - Imports: `java.util.ArrayList`, `java.util.List`, `java.util.Properties`

2. **Other Version (`NodeIdGenerator.java`)**:
   - Package: `org.apache.pig.impl.plan`
   - Imports: `java.util.Map`, `java.util.HashMap`
   - Class: `NodeIdGenerator`

The conflict appears to be due to different files being modified in different ways. The HEAD version is modifying `StarSpec.java` with specific imports, while the other branch is modifying `NodeIdGenerator.java` with different package and import declarations.

**Recommendation:**
- Since these are two different files with different purposes, the merge conflict should be resolved by handling each file separately.
- The `StarSpec.java` file should retain its original package and imports.
- The `NodeIdGenerator.java` file should retain its new package and imports.

Therefore, the conflict should be left as is, and each file should be merged separately.
