The conflict involves setting `this.versions` in different ways. The HEAD branch directly assigns `versions` while the other branch uses bitwise operations to preserve an `EXIST_FLAG`. Since the other branch preserves existing flags while updating versions, it's preferable.

```java
  public GetRequest maxVersions(final int versions) {
    if (versions <= 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Need a strictly positive number: "
                                         + versions);
    }
    this.versions = (versions << 1) | (this.versions & EXIST_FLAG);
    return this;
  }

  /**
   * Returns the maximum number of versions to return for each cell scanned.
```
