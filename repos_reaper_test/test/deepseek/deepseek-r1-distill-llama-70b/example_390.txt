The conflict appears to be about whether the method should test for responding to post change events or not. The comment suggests that responding to post build events (after the build is finished) is more appropriate than responding to change events.

Here is the resolved code that maintains the intent while preserving the test structure:

```java
	.verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
}

@Test
public void shouldNotRespondToPostChangeEvents() {
	// Not sure why we wanted to respond to change events, seems better to respond to the post build event, once the build is finished
	IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, POST_CHANGE, AUTO_BUILD, null);
	assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event));

	verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
}
```

I've resolved the conflict by:
1. Taking the method name and access modifier from the new branch
2. Keeping the comment explaining the rationale for the change
3. Maintaining the original assertion and verification code that was common to both versions

This preserves the test structure while aligning with the intent of responding to post build events rather than change events.
