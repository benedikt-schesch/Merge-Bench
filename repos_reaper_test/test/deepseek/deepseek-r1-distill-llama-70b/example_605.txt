To resolve this merge conflict, we need to combine the intent from both sides:

1. The `@Facebook` annotation is being added
2. The field is being renamed to better reflect that it represents a list

Here is the resolved code:

```java
   * @RestFB.GraphApi.Since 2.6
   * @return The Pages that this Page Likes.
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  @Facebook("likes")
  private Likes likesList;

  /**
   * The number of likes the page has.
  *
  * @return The number of likes the page has
```
