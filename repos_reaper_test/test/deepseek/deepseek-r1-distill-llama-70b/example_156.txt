Let me analyze this merge conflict. The conflict appears to be around how the GruntParser is being instantiated:

- The original code (`HEAD`) shows: `GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));`
- The new code (`2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea`) shows: `GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);`

The difference is that the new version adds `myPig` as a second parameter to the GruntParser constructor. This likely represents an update to use a different constructor signature that accepts a PigContext object (`myPig`) in addition to the script reader.

The surrounding context shows that `myPig` is already being used later in the code to access properties. Based on this, the newer version of the code that includes `myPig` in the constructor call is likely the intended change. The GruntParser likely requires this additional parameter in the updated version of the codebase being merged.

The conflict appears to be about updating the GruntParser instantiation to match a newer API signature that requires a PigContext.

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "illustrate b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            myPig.getPigContext().getProperties().setProperty("pig.usenewlogicalplan", "true");
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
