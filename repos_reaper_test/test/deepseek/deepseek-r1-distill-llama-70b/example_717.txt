To resolve this merge conflict, we need to harmonize the access to `sMediaPlayer`. The main intent is to safely retrieve the media player and return its position. Here's the resolved code:

```java
    @Override
    public long getPosition() {
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            return sMediaPlayer.getCurrentPosition();
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

This version ensures `sMediaPlayer` is properly retrieved and checked, maintaining both correctness and style consistency.
