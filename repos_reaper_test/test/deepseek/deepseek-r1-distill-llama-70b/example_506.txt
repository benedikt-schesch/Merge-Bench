I'll preserve the context and merge the code since both operations (loading sound and texture) appear to be part of the same initialization logic. Here's the merged code:

```java
		try {
			this.mExplosionSound = SoundFactory.createSoundFromAsset(this.mEngine.getSoundManager(), this, "explosion.ogg");
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```
