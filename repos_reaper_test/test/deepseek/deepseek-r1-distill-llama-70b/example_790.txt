I see a merge conflict between two different ways to initialize `batched_rpcs`. On one side, it uses `new MultiAction(server_version)` and on the other side, it uses `new MultiAction()` without any parameters.

The intent appears to be to create a new `MultiAction` object, but there's ambiguity whether it should take a `server_version` parameter or not. Since I don't have enough context to determine whether the `server_version` parameter is required or not, I will preserve the conflict:

```java
      if (batch.size() < 1024) {  // XXX Don't hardcode.
        batch = null;  // We're going to buffer this edit for now.
      } else {
        // Execute the edits buffered so far.  But first we must clear
        // the reference to the buffer we're about to send to HBase.
