The conflict appears to be about code formatting (brace placement) rather than semantic changes. Since both versions are logically identical, I will preserve the conflict:

```java
        if (lo instanceof LOCogroup) {
            assertTrue(((LOCogroup) lo).getRequestedParallelism() == 16);
        } else {
            fail("Error: Unexpected Parse Tree output");
