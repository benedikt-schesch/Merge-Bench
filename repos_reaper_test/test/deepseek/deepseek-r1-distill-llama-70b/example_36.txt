The conflict appears to be about whether the `commandName` parameter should be included in the method signature. The branch on the left (HEAD) omits the `commandName` parameter, while the branch on the right includes it. 

Given the context, we can infer that the method's intent is to print usage information, and including a `commandName` parameter would be semantically meaningful for that purpose. Therefore, it makes sense to preserve the method signature that includes the `commandName` parameter.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
    public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, String commandName, CommandMetadata command, UsagePrinter out)
    {
        //
        // NAME
        //
        out.append("NAME").newline();
```
