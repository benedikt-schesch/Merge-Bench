The conflict arises from the order of criteria in the yt-dlp selection. The intended behavior is to first limit videos to 576p, then choose the best video codec up to h264, and finally the best audio codec up to aac. The other branch correctly reflects this by ordering the criteria as res:576, hcodec:h264, and acodec:aac.

```java
         * Download the best video with best vcodec no better than h264 and
         * the best audio with best acodec no better than aac and
         * with neither height nor width larger than 576.
