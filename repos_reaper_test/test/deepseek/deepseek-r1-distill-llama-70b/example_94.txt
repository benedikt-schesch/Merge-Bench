The conflict is due to differing constructor arguments for `Game`. The right side includes an additional `gameOptionsProvider` argument. This suggests that `Game`'s constructor was modified to accept this new parameter. To resolve this, we use the updated constructor from the right side.

```java
    // remove game 1 using its own method -- this should be how it always happens in production
    gameManager.destroyGame(1);
    // make sure it re-uses that id
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
    gameManager.getGames().put(1,
            new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
                    formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));
    assertEquals(-1, gameManager.get().intValue());

    // remove game 1 out from under it, to make sure it'll fix itself
    gameManager.getGames().remove(1);
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
```
