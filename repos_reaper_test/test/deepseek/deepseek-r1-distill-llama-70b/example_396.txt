To resolve this merge conflict, we need to combine the initialization of both `filterList` and `testNGConfigurator` using the new filter file location from the environment's working directory.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. Use the new filter file location construction from the environment's working directory.
2. Initialize `filterList` with the newly constructed filter file.
3. Initialize `testNGConfigurator` using the same new filter file location.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    {
        checkNotNull(environment, "No runtime environment is configured. Maybe because the project has no jdk.");

        runtimeEnvironment = environment;
        this.eventQueue = eventQueue;
        String filterFileLocation = environment.getWorkingDirectory().getAbsolutePath() + File.separator
                        + "infinitest.filters";
        filterList = new RegexFileFilter(new File(filterFileLocation));
        testNGConfigurator = new TestNGConfigurator(new File(filterFileLocation));
        runnerClass = MultiProcessRunner.class;
        controller = new SingleLockConcurrencyController();
    }
