The conflict is purely about indentation style (spaces vs. tab) for initializing the `hash` variable. Both sides are initializing the hash to 7, which is functionally identical. The rest of the code is unchanged. I will preserve the original indentation style from the left side (HEAD).

```java
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        int hash = 7;
        if (pkgr.getKeyTuple())
        {
            hash = hash * 31 + pkgr.getKeyAsTuple().hashCode();
        }
        else

```
