This is a merge conflict where both changes are adding different content to the Subscription class. The HEAD branch added a serialVersionUID while the other branch added documentation for a property. Since both additions are beneficial, we should incorporate both changes together.

```java
 * 
 * @author <a href="http://restfb.com">Norbert Bartels</a>
 * @since 1.5
 */
public class Subscription extends AbstractFacebookType {

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  /**
   * Indicates the object type that this subscription applies to.
   * 
   * type: user, page, permissions, payments
