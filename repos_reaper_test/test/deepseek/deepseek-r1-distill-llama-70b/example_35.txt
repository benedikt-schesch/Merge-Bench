I see a merge conflict between two different versions of the `getVersion()` method. Each side is returning a different default version ("1.4" in HEAD vs "1.2" in the other branch). Since I don't have enough context to determine which default version is more appropriate, I will return the snippet with the conflict markers preserved:

```java
    @Override
    public String getVersion() {
        String version = null;
        try {
            version = ServerInfo.class.getPackage().getImplementationVersion();
<<<<<<< HEAD
        } catch (Exception e) {
        }
        return version != null ? version : "1.4";
=======
        } catch (Exception e) {}
        return version != null ? version : "1.2";
>>>>>>> c85cbed209c6bf46d7456c18480f2de60b8652b4
    }

    @Override
    public String getStartupTime() {
        return startupTime;

```
