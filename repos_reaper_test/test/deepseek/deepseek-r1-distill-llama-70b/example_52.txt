The conflict is about two different ways to initialize a `HashMap`. The older style explicitly specifies the type parameters, while the newer style uses the diamond operator `<>`, which is more concise and relies on type inference.

Both initializations are semantically equivalent and will work the same way. The resolution uses the more modern (post-Java 7) diamond operator style, which is cleaner and more idiomatic in contemporary Java code.

```java
   *
   * @param player The player for whom to get status.
   * @return Information for {@code player}: Name, score, status.
   */
  public Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object> getPlayerInfo(final Player player) {
    final Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object> playerInfo = new HashMap<>();
    // TODO make sure this can't happen in the first place
    if (player == null) {
      return playerInfo;
    }
    playerInfo.put(GamePlayerInfo.NAME, player.getUser().getNickname());
```
