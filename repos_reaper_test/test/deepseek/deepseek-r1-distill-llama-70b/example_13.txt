To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent of both versions. The key difference is the cast to `PluginManager` in the right side. The cast is necessary if `Spout.getPluginManager()` doesn't directly return a `PluginManager` instance. Since ensuring the correct type is important, the right side is preferred.

```java
	private DateFormat dateFormat;
	private List<Widget> lines = new ArrayList<Widget>();
	private float scroll = 0;

	public DevConsole(Font font) {
		this.plugin = ((PluginManager) Spout.getPluginManager()).getMetaPlugin();
		this.font = font;
		init();
	}
	
	public void clearConsole() {
```
