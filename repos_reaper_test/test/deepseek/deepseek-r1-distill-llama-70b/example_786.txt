The conflict is resolved by using `Deferred<?> deferred` to ensure proper generics type safety. Here is the resolved code:

```java
   * @param deferred A deferred one can wait on before retrying the failed RPC.
   */
  PleaseThrottleException(final String msg,
                          final HBaseException cause,
                          final HBaseRpc rpc,
                          final Deferred<?> deferred) {
    super(msg, cause);
    this.rpc = rpc;
    this.deferred = deferred;
  }
```
