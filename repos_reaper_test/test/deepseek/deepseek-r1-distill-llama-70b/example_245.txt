Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
        // for backward compatibility
        PigInputFormat.sJob = conf;

        InputFormat inputFormat = loadFunc.getInputFormat();

        List<Long> inpLimitLists =
                (ArrayList<Long>)ObjectSerializer.deserialize(
                        conf.get("pig.inpLimits"));

        return new PigRecordReader(inputFormat, pigSplit, loadFunc, context, inpLimitLists.get(pigSplit.getInputIndex()));
    }
```

I resolved the conflict by keeping the version without the trailing space since it appears to be the only difference between the two versions and is a whitespace styling preference. The functionality remains the same in both cases.
