I cannot resolve this merge conflict because it requires knowing whether `GenericMath` is used in the code or not. The conflict shows that one side removes the import while the other keeps it, but without seeing the code that uses this import, I cannot determine which side is correct.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
import org.spout.api.material.range.EffectRange;
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.resource.SpoutModels;
import org.spout.api.util.bytebit.ByteBitSet;
import org.spout.api.util.flag.Flag;
