To resolve the merge conflict, we need to consider the necessary imports based on the project's current dependencies and usage. The HEAD version includes imports for `newArrayList` and JUnit 5's `assertEquals`, which are likely required if the code uses these methods and has migrated to JUnit 5.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
 * SOFTWARE.
 */
package org.infinitest;

import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

import java.io.File;
<<<<<<< HEAD
