To resolve this merge conflict, we need to determine which version of the method signature is correct based on the intent of the changes.

**Analysis:**

1. The **HEAD** version uses `String functionSpec` as the second parameter.

2. The other branch (1488b22) uses `FuncSpec functionSpec` as the second parameter.

3. Looking at the surrounding logic, the method appears to handle registration of function specifications.

**Resolution:**

The change to `FuncSpec functionSpec` in the other branch makes more semantic sense since:
1. It uses a typed object (`FuncSpec`) rather than a raw string, which better encapsulates the function specification
2. It aligns with the parameter being used in the method logic where it's being stored in the `definedFunctions` map along with the function name

Based on this analysis, the resolved code should use the version from the other branch:

```java
     * @param function - the new function alias to define.
     * @param functionSpec - the FuncSpec object representing the name of 
     * the function class and any arguments to constructor.
     * 
     */
    public void registerFunction(String function, FuncSpec functionSpec) {
        if (functionSpec == null) {
            definedFunctions.remove(function);
        } else {
            definedFunctions.put(function, functionSpec);
        }

```
