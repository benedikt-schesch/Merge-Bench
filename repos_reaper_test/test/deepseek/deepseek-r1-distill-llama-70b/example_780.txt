To resolve this merge conflict, we need to determine whether `EMPTY_ARRAY` or `ZERO_ARRAY` is the correct constant to use in the `GetRequest.exists` method calls.

1. **Compare the Constants**:
   - Both `EMPTY_ARRAY` and `ZERO_ARRAY` are likely constants representing empty byte arrays.
   - If they are equivalent (both `new byte[0]`), the choice between them is a matter of naming preference.

2. **Analyze the Context**:
   - The code is fetching the first region of the table, and the `GetRequest.exists` method is used to check existence.
   - The `EMPTY_ARRAY` constant is used in the HEAD version, while `ZERO_ARRAY` is used in the other branch.

3. **Determine Intent**:
   - If `ZERO_ARRAY` is a more descriptive name and part of a refactor, it might be the intended constant.
   - If the team has standardized on `ZERO_ARRAY`, it should be used for consistency.

4. **Make the Decision**:
   - Since the intent is ambiguous without more context, it's best to consult the team or leave the conflict unresolved.

Here's the original code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
                                                  final byte[] family) {
    // Just "fault in" the first region of the table.  Not the most optimal or
    // useful thing to do but gets the job done for now.  TODO(tsuna): Improve.
    final HBaseRpc dummy;
    if (family == EMPTY_ARRAY) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      dummy = GetRequest.exists(table, EMPTY_ARRAY);
    } else {
      dummy = GetRequest.exists(table, EMPTY_ARRAY, family);
=======
      dummy = GetRequest.exists(table, ZERO_ARRAY);
    } else {
      dummy = GetRequest.exists(table, ZERO_ARRAY, family);
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    }
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    final Deferred<Object> d = (Deferred) sendRpcToRegion(dummy);
    return d;
  }
```
