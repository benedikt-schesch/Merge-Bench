The merge conflict here is about the opening curly brace placement in the method signature. Both sides aim to implement the same `isNotEqualTo` method with identical functionality, differing only in code style. The brace placement is a stylistic choice, not a semantic difference. Therefore, the conflict is resolved by choosing one style.

```java
  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
```
