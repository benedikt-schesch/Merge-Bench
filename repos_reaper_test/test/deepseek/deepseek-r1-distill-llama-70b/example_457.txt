The conflict is between importing `DigestUtils` from Apache Commons Codec in one branch and no import in the other. Since the intent is ambiguous without seeing the full code, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved.

```java
import javax.annotation.Nonnull;
import javax.annotation.Nullable;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils;
