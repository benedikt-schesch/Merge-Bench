Here's the merged code snippet with the conflict resolved:

```java
        // Piggyback a version request in the 1st packet, after the payload
        // we were trying to send.  This way we'll have the version handy
        // pretty quickly.  Since it's most likely going to fit in the same
        // packet we send out, it adds ~zero overhead.  But don't piggyback
        // a version request if the payload is already a version request.
        final ChannelBuffer buf;
        if (!isVersionRequest(payload)) {
          final RegionClient client = ctx.getPipeline().get(RegionClient.class);
          final ChannelBuffer version =
            client.encode(client.getProtocolVersionRequest());
          buf = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(header, payload, version);
        } else {

```

The conflict was resolved by:
1. Making `ChannelBuffer buf` final as it should be since it's not being reassigned
2. Removing the `false &&` condition since it was preventing the piggyback version request functionality from being executed
3. Maintaining consistent code formatting between both versions

This resolution preserves the intent of piggybacking version requests while maintaining proper variable scoping and code functionality.
