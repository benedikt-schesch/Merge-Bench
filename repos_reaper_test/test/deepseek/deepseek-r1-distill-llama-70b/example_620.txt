Here's the resolved code snippet, maintaining the original structure and including the necessary import:

```java
import com.restfb.Facebook;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper.JsonMappingCompleted;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookJsonMappingException;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
import com.restfb.types.Checkin.Place.Location;
import com.restfb.util.DateUtils;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
```

The conflict was resolved by incorporating the Location import from the a17acec branch, as it's necessary for functionality, and removing the conflicting blank line.
