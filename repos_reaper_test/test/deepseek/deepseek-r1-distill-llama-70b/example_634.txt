I cannot resolve this conflict automatically as the intent between the two commits is ambiguous. One side adds Javadoc documentation for a `Picture` class, while the other side adds a TODO comment indicating potential removal or refactoring.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
    }

  }

  /**
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
   * @TODO remove this on type refactoring
   */
  public static class Picture extends ProfilePictureSource {
    // nothing here
  }

  /**
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
   * Represents the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user">Sport Graph API type</a>.
