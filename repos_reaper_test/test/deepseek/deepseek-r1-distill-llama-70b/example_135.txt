There's no clear indication that the whitespace changes indicate any semantic intent. The conflict appears to be about preserving or removing a commented line with numbers. The intent behind the change is ambiguous - it could be either removing temporary/test content or preserving it. I'll preserve the comment from HEAD since it might contain important information:

```java
        fw1.close();

        try {
           String[] args = { "-x", "local", "-c", PIG_FILE };
           PigStats stats = PigRunner.run(args, null);
           // 123
           assertTrue(stats.isSuccessful());
           assertEquals( 0, stats.getReturnCode() );
        } finally {
            new File(PIG_FILE).delete();
            Util.deleteFile(cluster, OUTPUT_FILE);
```
