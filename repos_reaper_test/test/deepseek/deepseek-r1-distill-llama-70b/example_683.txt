Here is the resolved snippet with the conflict:

```java
						+ "Consider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.";

				logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
						+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
						+ "\tFor the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for resource access permissions or node ownership during deployment.\n"
						+ "\tBecause of this ambiguity, node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported!\n\n"
						+ "\t" + ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
						+ "\n\n\tConsider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.\n"
						+ "###############################################################################"
				);
				publishWarningMessage(title, text);
			}
```

This resolution combines the:
- Detailed description of ambiguity impact
- Exclamation mark in the warning
- Sorted and properly collected ambiguous principals list
