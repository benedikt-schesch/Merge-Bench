I'll resolve the conflict by taking the version with the space as it appears to be a non-substantive formatting change while preserving the original intent of cloning the users list.

```java
				});
		return view;
	}

	public void refresh(ArrayList<User> users) {
		mUsers = (ArrayList<User>) users.clone();
		notifyDataSetChanged();
	}

	@Override
	public void refresh() {
```
