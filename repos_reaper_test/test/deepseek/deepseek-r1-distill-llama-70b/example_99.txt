Since the merge conflict is purely stylistic (placement of curly brace) and there is no semantic or functional difference between the two sides, I will preserve the conflict as is.

Here is the snippet with the conflict:

```java
  protected ByteAssert(Byte actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ByteAssert.class, description);
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected){
=======
  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD

```
