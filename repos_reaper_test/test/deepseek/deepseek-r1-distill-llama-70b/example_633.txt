The conflict is ambiguity over whether the list should contain `WorkExperience` or `Work` objects. Without additional context about which type is more appropriate, I will preserve the conflict:

```java

  @Facebook
  private List<UserDevice> devices = new ArrayList<UserDevice>();

  @Facebook
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private List<WorkExperience> work = new ArrayList<WorkExperience>();
=======
  private List<Work> work = new ArrayList<Work>();
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  @Facebook
  private List<Education> education = new ArrayList<Education>();

  @Facebook

```
