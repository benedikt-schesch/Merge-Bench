As an expert, I can see that both sides of the merge are attempting to call the same method `getDefinitionFromJaxrsSources` with the same parameters, but the formatting differs in how the method call is split across lines. This appears to be primarily a formatting conflict rather than a semantic one.

Since both versions are functionally equivalent and the intent is simply to call the method with the same arguments, I will preserve the conflict as is to allow the developer to choose the preferred formatting style.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
                    LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "Class " + defSource
                            + " is not supported");
                    System.exit(1);
                }
            } else if (!jaxRsResources.isEmpty()) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
                definition = getDefinitionFromJaxrsSources(defSource,
                        useSectionNamingPackageStrategy, applicationName,

                        endpoint, jaxRsResources);
            }
        }

        if (definition == null) {
```
