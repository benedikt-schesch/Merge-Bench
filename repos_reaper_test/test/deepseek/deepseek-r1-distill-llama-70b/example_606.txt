I'll help resolve this merge conflict by considering the intent of both changes.

The HEAD branch adds a `serialVersionUID` which is important for Java serialization compatibility, while the other branch adds a field with Javadoc and Lombok annotations for getter/setter generation. Both changes appear to be additive and can coexist.

Here's the resolved code:

```java

  }

  public static class MailingAddress extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * The mailing address ID.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter

```
