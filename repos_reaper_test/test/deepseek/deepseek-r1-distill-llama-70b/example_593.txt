To resolve this conflict, we need to determine which approach aligns better with the intended functionality and library usage.

**Analysis:**
- The code is adding key-value pairs to a `JSONObject`
- The left side (HEAD) uses `add()` and catches `ParseException`
- The right side uses `put()` and catches `JsonException`

**Resolution:**
The change from `add()` to `put()` appears to be part of an update to the JSON processing library being used. `put()` is the more commonly used method for adding key-value pairs in many JSON libraries.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
          "Provided queries must have non-blank keys and values. You provided: " + queries);
      }

      try {
        jsonObject.put(trimToEmpty(entry.getKey()), trimToEmpty(entry.getValue()));
      } catch (JsonException e) {
        // Shouldn't happen unless bizarre input is provided
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unable to convert " + queries + " to JSON.", e);
      }
    }
```
