Here's the resolved code where the merge conflict has been addressed by incorporating the `jsonFactory` parameter, likely reflecting a refactor to use the factory for creating the parser:

```java
  public final String getContentType() {
    return contentType;
  }

  public <T> T parse(HttpResponse response, Class<T> dataClass) throws IOException {
    return parserForResponse(jsonFactory, response).parseAndClose(dataClass, null);
  }

  /**
   * Returns a JSON parser to use for parsing the given HTTP response.
   * <p>
```
