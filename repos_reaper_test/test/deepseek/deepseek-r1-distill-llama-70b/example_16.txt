The conflict is over whether to include two imports (`Component` and `CameraComponent`) from the `org.spout.api.component` packages. The `HEAD` branch wants to include them while the other branch (`67bcb76a96f358fc131320b0611ffaa3bf3678c2`) does not. 

Without more context about how these imports are used in the rest of the file, it's ambiguous whether these imports are needed or not. The imports may be necessary for functionality in the `HEAD` branch that uses those classes, or they may be extraneous imports that were removed in the other branch.

Since the intent is ambiguous, I'll return the snippet with the conflict markers:

```java
