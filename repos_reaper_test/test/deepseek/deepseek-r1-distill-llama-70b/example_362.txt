To resolve this merge conflict, we need to consider the two different approaches being merged:

1. **HEAD Version**: Adds the parser first and then builds a GET request, setting the URL separately.
2. **Feature Branch Version**: Uses a factory to create the request with the URL upfront, then adds the parser.

**Decision**: The feature branch version is preferable as it uses a more explicit and type-safe approach with `GenericUrl`, making the code more maintainable. The order of operations is also more logical - creating the request with the URL first, then adding the parser.

# Resolved Code:

```java
   * @throws HttpResponseException if the authentication response has an error code
   * @throws IOException some other kind of I/O exception
   */
  public TokenInfoResponse requestTokenInfo() throws IOException {
    HttpTransport authSubTransport = this.authSubTransport;
    HttpRequest request = authSubTransport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(
        new GenericUrl("https://www.google.com/accounts/AuthSubTokenInfo"));
    request.addParser(AuthKeyValueParser.INSTANCE);
    return request.execute().parseAs(TokenInfoResponse.class);
  }

  /** Updates the authorization headers. */
  private void updateAuthorizationHeaders() {
```
