To resolve the merge conflict, we need to combine the parameters from both branches, ensuring all necessary dependencies are included in the correct order. The `Game` constructor in one branch expects additional parameters that the other branch is missing. By appending the extra parameters from the second branch after the first branch's parameters, we ensure the constructor is called correctly.

```java
  public void setUp() {
    cuMock = createMock(ConnectedUsers.class);
    gmMock = createMock(GameManager.class);
    metricsMock = createMock(Metrics.class);
    game = new Game(0, cuMock, gmMock, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider);
  }
