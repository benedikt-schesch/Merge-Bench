I cannot resolve this conflict as the intent is ambiguous. Both sides are trying to declare a set of deck IDs, but one uses `Integer` and the other uses `String` as the type parameter. Without additional context about which type is correct for the system's requirements, I cannot determine which side should take precedence. I will return the snippet with the conflict:

```java
  private final ConnectedUsers connectedUsers;
  private final GameManager gameManager;
  private final Provider<Session> sessionProvider;
  private final Object blackCardLock = new Object();
  private final GameOptions options;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private final Set<Integer> customDecksIds = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<Integer>());
=======
  private final Set<String> cardcastDeckIds = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());
