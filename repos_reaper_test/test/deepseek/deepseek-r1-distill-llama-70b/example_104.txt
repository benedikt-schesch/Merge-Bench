I'll keep the conflict markers since it's ambiguous whether the parameter type should be `short` or `Short`. Both versions need to be examined to determine which type is more appropriate based on the intended usage and surrounding code context.

```java
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

    shorts.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
