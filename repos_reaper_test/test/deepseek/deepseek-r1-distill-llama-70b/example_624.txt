Here is the resolved code snippet that combines both changes by preserving the `serialVersionUID` and incorporating the new annotations and Javadoc:

```java
    }
  }

  public static class Targeting extends AbstractFacebookType {

    /**
     * @RestFB.GraphApi.Since 2.8
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
