I see a merge conflict between two different boolean preference entries being added to the editor. Let's analyze the intent:

- The HEAD version adds "SmsReportDelivery" with the value of smsReportDelivery
- The other branch adds "MessageResultsAPIEnable" with messageResultsAPIEnable

The keys are different, suggesting these are distinct settings. It's unclear whether both should be preserved or one should replace the other. I'll preserve the conflict since the intent is ambiguous:

```java
        editor.putBoolean("EnableBlacklist", enableBlacklist);
        editor.putBoolean("EnableWhitelist", enableWhitelist);
        editor.putBoolean("EnableLog", enableLog);
        editor.putInt("BatteryLevel", batteryLevel);
        editor.putString("AlertPhoneNumber", alertPhoneNumber);
<<<<<<< HEAD
        editor.putBoolean("SmsReportDelivery", smsReportDelivery);
=======
        editor.putBoolean("MessageResultsAPIEnable", messageResultsAPIEnable);
>>>>>>> bc9125dc30f2833e4ac24ec01ecf1db7debbbf77
        editor.commit();
    }
