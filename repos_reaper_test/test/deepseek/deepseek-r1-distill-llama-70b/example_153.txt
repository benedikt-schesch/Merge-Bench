Here is the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict addressed:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "explain b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```

The conflict was resolved by taking the `GruntParser` constructor with the additional `myPig` parameter from the feature branch, as it likely provides necessary context or configuration for the parser.
