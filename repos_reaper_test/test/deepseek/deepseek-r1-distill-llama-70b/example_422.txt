To resolve this merge conflict, we need to consider the intent of both sides. The `HEAD` branch is importing `JBakeProperty` while the other branch is importing `DocumentModel`. Both imports appear to be necessary for different purposes - one related to configuration properties and the other to document modeling.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
package org.jbake.template.model;

import org.jbake.app.ContentStore;
import org.jbake.app.DocumentList;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes;
import org.jbake.template.ModelExtractor;

import java.util.Map;
```

Both imports are preserved as they serve different purposes in the codebase.
