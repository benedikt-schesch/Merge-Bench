I'll preserve the context and resolve the conflict by combining both changes, since one adds a new field and the other just has a trivial whitespace difference.

```java
 * contains the line of text.
 */
public class TextLoader implements LoadFunc{
    BufferedPositionedInputStream in;
    final private static Charset utf8 = Charset.forName("UTF8");
    long end;
    private TupleFactory mTupleFactory = TupleFactory.getInstance();

    public void bindTo(String fileName, BufferedPositionedInputStream in, long offset, long end) throws IOException {
        this.in = in;
        this.end = end;
        // Since we are not block aligned we throw away the first
```
