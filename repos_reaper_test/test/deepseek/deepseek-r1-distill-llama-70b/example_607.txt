Here is the merged code snippet that resolves the conflict by including both the `serialVersionUID` and the method documentation:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class Engagement extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * Number of people who like this.
     * 
     * @return Number of people who like this
     */
```
