The conflict is about how to set the `VERSION` constant. The `HEAD` branch sets a fixed version "1.30.5" directly, while the other branch uses a `getVersion()` method to dynamically retrieve the version. Since using a method to get the version is more flexible and maintainable, that's the better approach.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
 * @author rmistry@google.com (Ravi Mistry)
 */
public final class GoogleUtils {

  /** Current release version. */
  public static final String VERSION = getVersion();
>>>>>>> a6c6decbd4a162ff4030e2c3f74c72eb6ac9eddb

  // NOTE: Integer instead of int so compiler thinks it isn't a constant, so it won't inline it
  /**
   * Major part of the current release version.
   *

```
