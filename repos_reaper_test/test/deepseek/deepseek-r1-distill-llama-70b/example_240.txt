I'll analyze the merge conflict and attempt to resolve it based on the intent of both changes.

The merge conflict shows two different sets of imports being added:
- The left side (HEAD) adds `import java.io.IOException`
- The right side adds several new imports: `import java.io.OutputStream;`, `import java.lang.reflect.Method;`, while keeping `import java.io.IOException;`

The common intent appears to be adding necessary imports for the code to function, with the right side including additionalULK imports. Since `java.io.IOException` is common to both and the right side adds more specific imports that might be needed for the implementation, I'll preserve all imports from both sides.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
package org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collection;
```
