To resolve this merge conflict, we need to ensure that both changes are incorporated while maintaining the intended functionality. The left side (HEAD) has a concrete `start()` method, while the right side introduces an abstract `start()` method and adds a new `start(boolean)` method. The conflict arises because both sides modify the same method differently.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
@Override
public String getAPIVersion() {
    return SpoutEngine.class.getPackage().getImplementationVersion();
}

public abstract void start();

public void start(boolean checkWorlds) {
    Spout.info("Spout is starting in {0}-only mode.", getPlatform().name().toLowerCase());
    Spout.info("Current version is {0} (Implementing SpoutAPI {1}).", getVersion(), getAPIVersion());
    Spout.info("This software is currently in alpha status so components may");
    Spout.info("have bugs or not work at all. Please report any issues to");
    Spout.info("http://issues.spout.org");
```

The resolution combines both changes by making `start()` abstract and adding the new `start(boolean checkWorlds)` method, thus preserving the intended refactoring and additional functionality.
