I'll provide the entire snippet with the conflict resolved, choosing the right side's approach as it correctly sets the instance variable and uses the appropriate method.

```java
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public void onAttached() {
		this.projection = MatrixMath.createPerspective(fieldOfView, 4.0f / 3.0f, .001f, 1000f);
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public Matrix4 getProjection() {
```
