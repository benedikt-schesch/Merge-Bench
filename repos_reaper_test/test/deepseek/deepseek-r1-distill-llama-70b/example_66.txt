The conflict is about how to initialize an ArrayList with an initial capacity. The HEAD version uses `new ArrayList<>(playedCards.size())` while the other branch uses `new ArrayList<>();` The most performant approach is to use the initial capacity constructor when known. Both achieve the same functionality but the initial capacity version is more efficient.

```java
    } else {
      // getPlayerForUser synchronizes on players. This has caused a deadlock in the past.
      // Good idea to not nest synchronizes if possible anyway.
      final Player player = getPlayerForUser(user);
      synchronized (playedCards) {
        final List<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>> cardData =
            new ArrayList<>(playedCards.size());
        int faceDownCards = playedCards.size();
        if (playedCards.hasPlayer(player)) {
          cardData.add(getWhiteCardData(playedCards.getCards(player)));
          faceDownCards--;
        }
```
