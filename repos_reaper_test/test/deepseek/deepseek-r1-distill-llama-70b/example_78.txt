To resolve this merge conflict, we need to carefully consider the changes from both branches and integrate them without losing any functionality or intent.

The **HEAD** branch adds a `CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND` error related to custom decks, while the other branch adds two new Cardcast-related errors: `CARDCAST_CANNOT_FIND` and `CARDCAST_INVALID_ID`. These are distinct error cases that can coexist in the codebase.

Here is the merged code:

```java
    BAD_REQUEST("br", "Bad request."),
    @DuplicationAllowed
    BANNED(DisconnectReason.BANNED, "Banned."),
    CANNOT_JOIN_ANOTHER_GAME("cjag", "You cannot join another game."),
    CAPSLOCK("CL", "Try turning caps lock off."),
    CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND("cscf", "Cannot find custom deck with the given ID or URL or invalid JSON "
        + "was provided."),
    CARDCAST_CANNOT_FIND("ccf", "Cannot find Cardcast deck with given ID. If you just added this"
            + " deck to Cardcast, wait a few minutes and try again."),
    CARDCAST_INVALID_ID("cii", "Invalid Cardcast ID. Must be exactly 5 characters."),
    DO_NOT_HAVE_CARD("dnhc", "You don't have that card."),
    GAME_FULL("gf", "That game is full. Join another."),
    INVALID_CARD("ic", "Invalid card specified."),
    INVALID_GAME("ig", "Invalid game specified."),
    INVALID_ID_CODE("iid", "Identification code, if provided, must be between 8 and 100 characters,");
```

This resolution:
1. Preserves the `CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND` error from the HEAD branch
2. Adds the new Cardcast-related errors from the other branch
3. Maintains consistent formatting and organization
