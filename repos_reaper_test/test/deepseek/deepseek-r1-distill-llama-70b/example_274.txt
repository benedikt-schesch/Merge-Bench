To resolve this merge conflict, we need to consider both the functional change and the logging message. The other branch includes an additional operation and a more precise log message, which should be preserved.

```java
            } catch (PlanException e) {
                int errCode = 2029;
                String msg = "Error rewriting join package.";
                throw new MRCompilerException(msg, errCode, PigException.BUG, e);
            }
            mr.phyToMRMap.put(forEach, pack);
            LogFactory.getLog(LastInputStreamingOptimizer.class).info(
                    "Rewrite: POPackage->POForEach to POPackage(JoinPackager)");
        }

    }
