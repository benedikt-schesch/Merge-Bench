To resolve the merge conflict, we should preserve the static factory instance as it's essential for tuple creation in Hadoop MapReduce utilities. The HEAD branch correctly initializes TupleFactory, which is necessary for the class's functionality.

```java
 * A class of utility static methods to be used in the hadoop map reduce backend
 */
public class MapRedUtil {

    private static Log log = LogFactory.getLog(MapRedUtil.class);
    private static final TupleFactory tf = TupleFactory.getInstance();

    public static final String FILE_SYSTEM_NAME = "fs.default.name";

    /**
     * Loads the key distribution sampler file
```
