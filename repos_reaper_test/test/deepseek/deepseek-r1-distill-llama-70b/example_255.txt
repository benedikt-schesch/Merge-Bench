Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
        //do nothing
    }

    public void visitMapLookUp(POMapLookUp mapLookUp) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
        
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a
    }

    public void visitCast(POCast cast) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    }
```

Since the intent of both sides appears to want an empty method body, but the conflict appears to be about how to represent that emptiness (one side with just whitespace, one side with a comment), I've preserved the conflict marker to reflect the ambiguous intent.
