The conflict appears to be due to the removal or addition of lines in different branches. In this case, it seems both branches have added similar code but in different orders. The intent from both sides is likely to unlock camera settings after handling the image animation. The conflict can be resolved by maintaining both pieces of code while preserving the logical order.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                    flinger.setImageBitmap(info.mThumbnail);
                    flinger.doAnimation();
                }
            });

            // Unlock camera auto settings
            mCamManager.setLockSetup(false);
            mCamManager.setStabilization(false);
        }
```
