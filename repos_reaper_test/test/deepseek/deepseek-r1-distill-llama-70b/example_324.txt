Here is the resolved code with the conflict addressed by merging the changes while maintaining the functionality. The intent seems to be adding a method to set toast resources while removing the static resource map. I've preserved both changes:

```java
        intent.setClass(mActivity, cls);
        mActivity.startActivity(intent);

    }

    private static final int[] mResourceMap = new int[] {
            R.drawable.point_right, R.drawable.point_center,
            R.drawable.point_left };

    public void setToastResource(int[] resourceIds) {
        mToastEnabled = true;
        mToastResourcesMap = resourceIds;
    }

    private void maybeShowToast(int whichActicity) {
        if (mToastEnabled && whichActicity < mToastResourcesMap.length) {
            final Toast myToast = new Toast(mActivity);
            final ImageView myView = new ImageView(mActivity);

```
