Here is the resolved code, taking into account the intent of both versions:

```java
    public static JobContext sJobContext = null;

    public static class Combine
            extends Reducer<PigNullableWritable, NullableTuple, PigNullableWritable, Writable> {

        private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Combine.class);

        //HADOOP-3226 Combiners can be called multiple times in both map and reduce
        private static boolean firstTime = true;
        
        private byte keyType;

        //The reduce plan
        private PhysicalPlan cp;
```

The resolution:
1. Maintained the static log initialization from the "other" version since it aligns with the intent of handling multiple calls
2. Kept the firstTime flag from the "other" version as it appears to be part of the HADOOP-3226 fix
3. Removed the non-static log initialization from HEAD since it would be redundant with the static log
4. Maintained the rest of the code context as it was
