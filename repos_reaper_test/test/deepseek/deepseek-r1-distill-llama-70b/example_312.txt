Here is the merged code that preserves changes from both branches while maintaining semantic integrity:

```java
public static final String TAG = "TwitterApplication";
  
public static ImageManager mImageManager;
public static TwitterDbAdapter mDb; 
public static TwitterApi mApi;
public static Weibo nApi; // new API
public static DatabaseHelper mDb2;
public static Context mContext;

@Override
public void onCreate() {
  super.onCreate();
```

I've merged the changes by:
1. Keeping the existing `TwitterApi mApi` and adding the new `Weibo nApi`
2. Adding the new `DatabaseHelper mDb2` alongside the existing `TwitterDbAdapter mDb`
3. Adding the `Context mContext`
4. Preserving the original spacing and organization as much as possible

This approach assumes that both APIs and database adapters need to coexist in the merged code. If this is not the intended behavior, further clarification would be needed to understand which variables should be kept or removed.
