Here's the code snippet with the merge conflict resolved while preserving both constructors:

```java
        this.options = options;
        this.maxUriLength = maxUriLength;
        this.maxImageSize = maxImageSize;
    }

    public CSSURLEmbedder(Reader in, int options, boolean verbose, int maxUriLength) throws IOException {
        this.code = readCode(in);
        this.verbose = verbose;
        this.options = options;
        this.maxUriLength = maxUriLength;
    }

    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Get/Set verbose flag
   JAABA****************************************************************Okay, I need to resolve the merge conflict in the given Java code. Let me see what's happening here.

The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two versions. The current branch (HEAD) has a constructor that initializes options, maxUriLength, and maxImageSize. The other branch is adding a new constructor that takes a Reader, options, verbose, and maxUriLength. It also reads the code from the Reader and sets the verbose flag.

First, I should check if these constructors can coexist. Since they have different parameter lists, they can be overloaded. That means both constructors can exist in the same class without causing errors.

So, the resolution is to accept both constructors. The HEAD's constructor remains, and the new constructor from the other branch is added. This way, all functionalities are preserved, and no code is lost.

I'll present the code with both constructors, removing the conflict markers. This should maintain the intended functionality from both branches.
Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict resolved:

```java
        this.options = options;
        this.maxUriLength = maxUriLength;
        this.maxImageSize = maxImageSize;
    }

    public CSSURLEmbedder(Reader in, int options, boolean verbose, int maxUriLength) throws IOException {
        this.code = readCode(in);
        this.verbose = verbose;
        this.options = options;
        this.maxUriLength = maxUriLength;
    }

    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Get/Set verbose flag
    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    public boolean getVerbose(){
```
