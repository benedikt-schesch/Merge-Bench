The conflict is resolved by choosing one style for the opening curly brace, consistent with the surrounding code. Here's the merged code:

```java

  protected ShortAssert(Short actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ShortAssert.class, description);
  }

  public ShortAssert isEqualTo(short expected){
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```
