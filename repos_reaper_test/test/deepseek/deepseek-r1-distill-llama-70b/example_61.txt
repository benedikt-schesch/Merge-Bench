Certainly! Here's how the merge conflict was resolved with an explanation:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Conflict:** The conflict is in the import statements where both sides import different sets of classes from `java.util`.

2. **Analyze Both Sides:** 
   - **HEAD:** Imports `List` and `ArrayList`.
   - **5adedd248...:** Imports `List`, `Set`, and `ArrayList`.

3. **Determine Intent:** The right side's import includes `Set`, suggesting it might be needed for new functionality.

4. **Resolve the Conflict:** Choose the more comprehensive import to support any potential new code that uses `Set`.

5. **Result:** Use the import statement with `List`, `Set`, and `ArrayList` to ensure all necessary classes are available.

**Resolved Code:**

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.ArrayList;
```
