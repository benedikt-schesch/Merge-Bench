The conflict is between loading a single texture versus a texture atlas. Here's the preserved snippet with both options:

```java
					ModPlayerExample.this.startPlayingMod();
				}
			});
		}

<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTexture);
=======
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```

Both options have different implications:

1. `mBitmapTexture` - Loads a single texture
2. `mBitmapTextureAtlas` - Loads a texture atlas (likely for sprite sheets)

The choice between the two depends on whether you're working with individual textures or spritesheets. If you're using a texture atlas for game sprites, you should use the texture atlas version. If you're working with a single bitmap texture, use the first version.

Since I don't have enough context to know which one is more appropriate for your specific use case, I've preserved the conflict for you to resolve based on your project requirements.
