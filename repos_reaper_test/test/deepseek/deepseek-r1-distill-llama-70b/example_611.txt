Here's the resolved code:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PagePaymentOptions extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * Whether the business accepts American Express as a payment option.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
```

I've merged both changes since they appear to be adding different elements to the class:
- The `serialVersionUID` from the HEAD branch
- The new American Express payment option field with its documentation and annotations from the other branch

The changes are non-conflicting as they add separate pieces of functionality to the class.
