I cannot resolve this conflict as the intent is unclear. The conflict appears to be between using `mBitmapTexture` vs `mBitmapTextureAtlas` when creating the `SpriteBatch`. The surrounding context does not provide enough information to determine which one was intended. I will return the original snippet with the conflict:

```java
		faceSprite1.setScale(2);
		faceSprite2.setRotation(45);

		/* Create the face and add it to the scene. */
<<<<<<< HEAD
		final SpriteBatch dynamicSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTexture, 2) {
=======
		final SpriteBatch dynamicSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, 2) {
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
			@Override
			public void onDrawSpriteBatch() {
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
				this.draw(faceSprite2);
			}
```
