To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes and preserve the new functionality while maintaining existing behavior where possible.

The conflict arises in the constructor where:
1. The original code (HEAD) directly assigns the input stream to `this.in`
2. The new code adds a condition to avoid buffering CBZip2InputStream

The new code is adding specific handling to avoid issues with CBZip2InputStream while maintaining the original buffering behavior for other input streams.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    long pos;
    InputStream in;
    final int bufSize = 1024;
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in, long pos) {
		// Don't buffer a bzip stream as it will cause problems for split
		// records.
		if (in instanceof CBZip2InputStream) this.in = in;
		else this.in = new BufferedInputStream(in, bufSize);
        this.pos = pos;
    }
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in){
        this(in,0);
```
