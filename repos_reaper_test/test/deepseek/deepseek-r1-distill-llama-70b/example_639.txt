The conflict appears to be trivial as both sides contain different but non-conflicting changes. One side adds a serialVersionUID while the other adds a field with Lombok annotations. We can merge them by combining both changes:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class Thumbnail extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * The name of the thumbnail
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
```
