The conflict appears to be about whether to show a Toast message when an item is clicked in the list view. The Toast is commented out in one branch but not present in the other branch. The surrounding context shows that the more substantial functionality is about getting a User object and handling it.

Given that the Toast is commented out, it appears to be debug code that was intentionally disabled. The more important functionality is the User handling logic which should be preserved. I will keep the commented out Toast to maintain debugging capabilities while preserving the main functionality.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
        listView.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener() {
            
            @Override
            public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> parent, View view,
                    int position, long id) {
                 //Toast.makeText(getBaseContext(), "选择第"+position+"个列表",Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                User user = getContextItemUser(position);
                if (user == null) {
                    Log.w(TAG, "selected item not available");
                    specialItemClicked(position);
                } else {
```
