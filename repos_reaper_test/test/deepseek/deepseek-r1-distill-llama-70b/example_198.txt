Since both sides of the merge are identical in this context, there is no actual conflict to resolve. The code snippets are exactly the same, just keeping the same line once.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
import org.apache.pig.impl.util.WrappedIOException;

public class PigContext implements Serializable, FunctionInstantiator {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    
    private transient final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());    
        
    public static final String JOB_NAME = "jobName";
    public static final String JOB_NAME_PREFIX= "PigLatin";
    
    /* NOTE: we only serialize some of the stuff 

```
