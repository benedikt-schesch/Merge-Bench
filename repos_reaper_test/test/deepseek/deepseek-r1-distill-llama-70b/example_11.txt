The conflict appears to be adding a client-specific check to start a mesh generator thread for regions when on the client platform. The code in the HEAD branch does not include this check while the feature branch adds it before the threshold warning.

The semantic intent is to ensure that the mesh generator thread is only started on the client side. The context shows that the threshold warning is still being evaluated after this check, which suggests this is an additive change rather than a conflict.

Here is the resolved code with proper spacing and both changes:

```java
		if (current != null) {
			return current;
		}
		
		((SpoutScheduler)Spout.getScheduler()).addAsyncManager(region);

		if (Spout.getEngine().getPlatform() == Platform.CLIENT) {
			region.startMeshGeneratorThread();
		}

		int threshold = warnThreshold.get();
		if (regionsLoaded.getAndIncrement() > threshold) {
			Spout.getLogger().info("Warning: number of spout regions exceeds " + threshold + " when creating (" +
                x + ", " + y + ", " + z + ")");
```
