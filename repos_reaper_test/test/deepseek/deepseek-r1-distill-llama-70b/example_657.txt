I cannot resolve the conflict with confidence because I don't have enough context about whether `java.util.Map` is needed. I'll preserve the conflict:

```java
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.fromInputStream;
import static java.net.HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK;

import java.io.IOException;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.util.Map;

/**
 * {@link WebRequestor} implementation that loads a file from the classpath instead of hitting the web. Useful for
 * running unit tests against local JSON textfiles.
 * 
```

If you can provide more context about whether the class uses `java.util.Map` in its implementation, I can help resolve the conflict more confidently.
