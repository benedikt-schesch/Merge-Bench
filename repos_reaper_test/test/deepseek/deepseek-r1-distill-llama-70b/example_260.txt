The conflict is between two different method signatures for the `ReadOnceBag` constructor. The key differences are:

1. The type of the first parameter: `LitePackager` vs. `Packager`
2. The type of the third parameter: `Object` vs. `PigNullableWritable`

Looking at the semantics:

1. `Packager` is likely the full interface/implementation while `LitePackager` suggests a lighter version
2. `PigNullableWritable` is likely a more specific type that handles nullable values and serialization

The_CODEWNNERifetime of the codebase would likely be better served with the more specific types from the right side of the merge since:
1. `Packager` is more standard
2. `PigNullableWritable` provides better type safety and null handling

Here is the resolved code:

```java
     * copying the elements of the iterator.
     * @param pkg POPackageLite
     * @param tupIter Iterator<NullableTuple>
     * @param key Object
     */
    public ReadOnceBag(Packager pkgr, Iterator<NullableTuple> tupIter,
            PigNullableWritable keyWritable) {
        this.pkgr = pkgr;
        this.tupIter = tupIter;
        this.keyWritable = keyWritable;
    }
```
