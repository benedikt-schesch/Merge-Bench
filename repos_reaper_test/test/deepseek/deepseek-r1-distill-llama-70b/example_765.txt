The conflicting lines are:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
            if (client.server_version < 0 && !isVersionRequest(payload)) {
=======
            if (!isVersionRequest(payload)) {
>>>>>>> e7ed675fb9763b412458f905c07d274b0ffc12d9
```

The intent of both sides appears to be avoiding piggybacking a version request when either:
1. The server version is unknown (`client.server_version < 0`) AND the payload isn't already a version request
2. The payload isn't already a version request (removes the server version check)

Since the intent is ambiguous about whether the server version check is still required in the newer version, I will preserve the conflict:

```java
            // pretty quickly. Since it's most likely going to fit in the same
            // packet we send out, it adds ~zero overhead. But don't piggyback a
            // version request if the payload is already a version request or if
            // we already know the server version.
            final ChannelBuffer buf;
<<<<<<< HEAD
            if (client.server_version < 0 && !isVersionRequest(payload)) {
=======
            if (!isVersionRequest(payload)) {
>>>>>>> e7ed675fb9763b412458f905c07d274b0ffc12d9
              final ChannelBuffer version =
                client.encode(client.getProtocolVersionRequest());
              buf = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(header, payload, version);
            } else {
              buf = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(header, payload);

```
