Here is the resolved code:

```java
    } else {
      // No specific qualifier to delete: delete the entire family.  Not that
      // if `family == null', we'll delete and setting this is harmless.
      this.qualifiers = DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER;
    }
    this.lockid = lockid;
  }

  @Override
  public byte[] table() {
```

I have removed the conflicting lines from the HEAD branch since the other branch's version:
1. Follows the comment's intent to delete the entire family by setting `this.qualifiers = DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER`
2. Maintains consistent spacing
3. Preserves the original intent of the code
