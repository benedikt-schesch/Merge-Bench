To resolve this merge conflict, I'll analyze both options and choose the one that best aligns with the test's intent. The test is named "Locked: Try Long Data" and refers to authorization when locked. 

I choose the HEAD version because `ConfigUriBeacon.INSUFFICIENT_AUTHORIZATION` better reflects an authorization issue when the device is locked, fitting the test scenario.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                  BluetoothGatt.GATT_SUCCESS)
      );
      specUriBeaconTestsBuilder.add(
          new Builder()
              .name("Locked: Try Long Data")
              .reference("https://github.com/google/uribeacon/blob/master/specification/ConfigService.md#32-lock")
              .write(ProtocolV2.DATA, TestData.LONG_URI, ConfigUriBeacon.INSUFFICIENT_AUTHORIZATION)
      );
      specUriBeaconTestsBuilder.add(
          new Builder()
              .name("Locked: Try Short Flags")
              .reference("https://github.com/google/uribeacon/blob/master/specification/ConfigService.md#32-lock")
