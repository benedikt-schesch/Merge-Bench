Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
   * 
   * @author <a href="http://restfb.com">Norbert Bartels</a>
   */
  public static class UserDevice extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String hardware;


```

The merge combines both changes:
1. Keeps the `serialVersionUID` from the HEAD version
2. Adds the new `hardware` field with its annotations from the other commit
3. Maintains proper spacing and formatting
