The merge conflict appears to involve variable declarations, and the intent is to include different variables in the merge. Since the intent is not entirely clear, I'll preserve both sides of the conflict:

```java
    private String mEditTargetBody = null;
    private String mDeleteTargetKind = null;
    private boolean mShouldClearReply = false;
    private AsyncTask<?, ?, ?> mCurrentDownloadCommentsTask = null;
    private final Object mCurrentDownloadCommentsTaskLock = new Object();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private String last_search_string;
    private int last_found_position = -1;
    private int translucent_yellow;
    // ProgressDialogs with percentage bars
    private AutoResetProgressDialog mLoadingCommentsProgress;

    private boolean mCanChord = false;
    
    // override transition animation available Android 2.0 (SDK Level 5) and above
    private static Method mActivity_overridePendingTransition;
```
