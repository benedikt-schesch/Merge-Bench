I'll keep the entire snippet with the conflict since the intent is ambiguous. Here's the snippet preserved with the conflict:

```java
            if (reader != null) {
                reader.close();
                setStreamConsumed(true);
            }
        }
<<<<<<< HEAD
        return str;
=======
>>>>>>> b807edeecf20796a588b8510ceb86d80f0cad699
    }

    public JSONObject asJSONObject() throws ResponseException {
        try {
            return new JSONObject(asString());
```

The conflict appears to be about whether to include the `return str;` statement. The HEAD version includes the return statement, while the other version implies that might not be present or might be different. Since it's not clear what the intended behavior should be, I'm preserving the conflict in the snippet.
