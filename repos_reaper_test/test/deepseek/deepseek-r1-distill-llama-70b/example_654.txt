To resolve the merge conflict, we need to incorporate both changes while maintaining the intended functionality. The feature branch adds the initialization of `dataList`, which is necessary for processing the JSON data. Here is the merged code:

```java
   *           If the provided {@code json} is invalid.
   * @since 1.6.7
   */
  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  public Connection(FacebookClient facebookClient, String json, Class<T> connectionType) {
    List<T> dataList = new ArrayList<T>();

    if (json == null) {
      throw new FacebookJsonMappingException("You must supply non-null connection JSON.");
    }
```
