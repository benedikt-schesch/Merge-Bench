To resolve this merge conflict, we need to combine both changes since they serve different purposes. The serialVersionUID is necessary for serialization, while the added Javadoc provides important context about the VideoStatus class.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
   * Represents the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/video-status/">Video Status Graph
   * API type</a>.
   * 
   * Status of a video.
   * 
   * Either "ready" (uploaded, encoded, thumbnails extracted), "processing" (not ready yet) or "error" (processing
   * failed).
   */
  public static class VideoStatus extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

```
