To resolve this merge conflict, we need to consider the purpose of the `BlockUpdateEvent` class and the necessary imports.

- `BlockUpdateEvent` is used to handle block updates in a chunk within the game world
- The event requires `Chunk` to reference the chunk being updated but does not require `Point` or `Quaternion`
- `Chunk` is correctly imported from `org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk`

Here is the resolved code:

```java
package org.spout.api.protocol.event;

import org.spout.api.event.HandlerList;
import org.spout.api.event.ProtocolEvent;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;

public class BlockUpdateEvent extends ProtocolEvent {
	private static final HandlerList handlers = new HandlerList();
	private final Chunk chunk;
	private final int x, y, z;
```
