The conflict is resolved by using the version that passes `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER`, indicating the intent to delete the family. This is more accurate than passing null.

```java

   */
  public DeleteRequest(final byte[] table,
                       final byte[] key,
                       final byte[] family) {
    this(table, key, family, DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER, RowLock.NO_LOCK);
=======
    this(table, key, family, DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER, RowLock.NO_LOCK);
