Here is the merged code that resolves the conflict while maintaining the intent of both changes:

```java
	static public File createInputFile(String tmpFilenamePrefix, 
			                           String tmpFilenameSuffix, 
			                           String[] inputData) 
	throws IOException {
		File f = File.createTempFile(tmpFilenamePrefix, tmpFilenameSuffix);
		f.deleteOnExit();
		PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(f), "UTF-8"));
		for (int i=0; i<inputData.length; i++){
			pw.println(inputData[i]);
		}
		pw.close();
		return f;
```
