The conflict is about adding an additional import statement. Both sides are adding different imports. The original file (HEAD) adds two imports related to Facebook exceptions, while the other branch adds an import for `JSONException`. Since these are distinct imports from different packages, they can coexist. I will merge them by keeping all imports.

```java

import com.restfb.exception.FacebookGraphException;
import com.restfb.exception.generator.DefaultFacebookExceptionGenerator;
import com.restfb.testutils.AssertJson;
import org.json.JSONException;

public class StatusExceptionTest extends AbstractJsonMapperTests {
