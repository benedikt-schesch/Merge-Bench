Here's the code snippet with the conflict resolved, maintaining the context and spacing:

```java
				w = w.right;
			} else {
				return w.x;
			}
		}
		return z == null ? null : z.x;
	}

	public T findGE(T u) {
		if (u == null) { // find the minimum value
			Node w = r;
```

The resolution uses `z == null` as it's the correct Java syntax, matching the context and functionality intended.
