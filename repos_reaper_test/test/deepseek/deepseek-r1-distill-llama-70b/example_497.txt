The conflict is between two different field declarations. One side declares a `BitmapTexture` and the other declares a `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Without more context about how these types are used in the rest of the codebase, it's ambiguous which one should be chosen. The conflict remains unresolved:

```java
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private int mFaceIDCounter;
	private final SparseArray<Sprite> mFaces = new SparseArray<Sprite>();


```
