The merge conflict revolves around whether to include the `@Beta` annotation. Since the intent is unclear, the conflict remains unresolved.

```java
   * @param certAndKey Certificate and private key input stream. The stream should contain one
   *     certificate and one unencrypted private key. If there are multiple certificates, only the
   *     first certificate will be used.
   * @return keystore for mutual TLS.
