I'll present both versions with their pros and cons:

```java
       * This is useful if, for example, you've got a @Facebook-annotated string field that you'd like to have a numeric
       * type shoved into.
       *
       * User beware: this will turn *anything* into a string, which might lead to results you don't expect.

      return jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue);
=======
      return rawValue.toString();
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    }

    if (Integer.class.equals(type) || Integer.TYPE.equals(type)) {
      return jsonHelper.getIntegerFrom(rawValue);
    }
```

The conflict is between using `jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue)` (HEAD) versus `rawValue.toString()` (other branch). Both achieve the goal of converting rawValue to a String, but:

- `jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue)` likely provides safer handling of JSON-specific conversions and edge cases
- `rawValue.toString()` is more direct but could potentially throw NullPointerException if rawValue is null

Since the comment explicitly warns about unexpected results from converting to string, and the intent seems to be providing a JSON-specific conversion, I would recommend using the jsonHelper method as it is likely more robust for this context. However, I'll present both versions as the intent isn't 100% clear without more context about the jsonHelper implementation.
