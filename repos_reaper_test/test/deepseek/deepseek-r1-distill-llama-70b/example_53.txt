Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
          if (!roundPlayers.contains(player)) {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
            break;
          }
          final List<WhiteCard> playerCards = playedCards.getCards(player);
          if (playerCards != null && blackCard != null
              && playerCards.size() == blackCard.getPick()) {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
          } else {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.PLAYING;
          }
        }
```

The conflict was about code formatting rather than logic, as both versions had the same conditional checks. I kept the HEAD version since it maintains the same logical structure while splitting the condition across lines for better readability.
