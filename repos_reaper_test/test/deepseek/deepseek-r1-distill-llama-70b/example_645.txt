I'll analyze the merge conflict and resolve it by focusing on the semantic intent of both sides. Both tests are checking the content type of a BinaryAttachment object.

The left side (HEAD) uses:
```java
assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html");
```

The right side (a17acec) uses:
```java
assertEquals("text/html", att.getContentType());
```

Both assertions are semantically equivalent - they're checking that the content type of the attachment is "text/html". The main difference is the assertion style:

1. The left side uses fluent assertion style with assertThat() and hasContentType()
2. The right side uses the traditional assertEquals() style

Since both achieve the same goal, I'll choose the assertThat() version as it's more modern and expressive. Here's the resolved code:

```java
  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_html() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.html", attachmentData.getBytes());
    assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html");
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_fallback() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
```
