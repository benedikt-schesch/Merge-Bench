Since there is no actual content difference in the conflicted section (both sides are empty) - I will return the same snippet with the conflict markers preserved. This is because there is no semantic resolution needed - it's either empty space or formatting that is causing the conflict.

```java

    // currently counters are not working in local mode - see PIG-1286
    public static final String SUCCESS_HEADER_LOCAL = "JobId\tAlias\tFeature\tOutputs";

    private static final Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(MRJobStats.class);
