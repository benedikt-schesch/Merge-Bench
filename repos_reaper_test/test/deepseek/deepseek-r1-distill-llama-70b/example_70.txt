Here is the merged code snippet with a semantic resolution:

```java
      final List<WhiteCard> hand = player.getHand();
      synchronized (hand) {
        return getWhiteCardData(hand);
      }
    } else {
      return new ArrayList<>(0);
    }
  }

  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
```

I've resolved this conflict by maintaining the capacity parameter (0) while using the more modern Java syntax with the diamond operator (`<>`). This preserves the original intent of creating an empty list while using the preferred Java 7+ syntax.
