To resolve this merge conflict, we need to consider the intent and potential performance implications of the two approaches.

1. **Understanding the Code Context**:
   - The code is inside a loop that processes `faceDownCards`
   - The loop adds card data to `cardData`
   - Both branches are adding a single-element list containing `WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()`

2. **Performance Considerations**:
   - `Arrays.asList()` creates a mutable list backed by the array
   - `Collections.singletonList()` creates an immutable singleton list that is more lightweight
   - Since we're only adding a single element and don't need mutability, `singletonList` is more efficient

3. **Resolution**:
   - Select the more performant option (`Collections.singletonList()`) since it's better suited for this use case

Here is the resolved code:

```java
          cardData.add(getWhiteCardData(playedCards.getCards(player)));
          faceDownCards--;
        }
        // TODO make this figure out how many blank cards in each spot, for multi-play cards
        while (faceDownCards-- > 0) {
          cardData.add(Collections.singletonList(WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()));
        }
        return cardData;
      }
    }
  }
```
