Since the merge conflict involves import statements, I will resolve it by preserving the more specific imports. The conflict is between wildcard imports and specific class imports. The specific imports are generally preferred as they make the code more maintainable by clearly showing the dependencies.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
import org.infinitest.intellij.plugin.launcher.InfinitestLauncher;
import org.infinitest.intellij.plugin.launcher.InfinitestLauncherImpl;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;

import com.intellij.openapi.fileEditor.FileEditorManager;
import com.intellij.openapi.wm.ToolWindowManager;

public class WhenLaunchingInfinitest {
	private ModuleSettings moduleSettings;

	@Before

```
