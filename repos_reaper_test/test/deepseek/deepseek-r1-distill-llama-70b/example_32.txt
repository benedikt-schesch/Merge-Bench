The conflict appears to be about import statements. The left side (HEAD) is importing Vector3 from a different package, while the right side is importing both Chunk and Vector3 from different packages. The most logical resolution is to take both imports since:

1. The Vector3 import on the right appears to be from the correct "api" package
2. The Chunk import is needed for the cuboid implementation

Here is the resolved snippet:

package org.spout.api.util.cuboid;

import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;

/**
 * This class implements a Cuboid common methods for a one dimensional array Cuboid Buffer
 *
 * Elements are stored in column order and each column is +1 on the Z dimension relative to the previous one.
