To resolve this merge conflict, we need to combine the contributions from both sides. The HEAD version contains the `@param` tag, while the other side adds the `@return` and `@throws` tags, which are necessary for complete documentation.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
    }

    /**
     * Returns the length of a file in bytes which exists in the HDFS (accounts for replication).
     * @param filename
     * @return length of the file in bytes
     * @throws IOException
     */
    public long fileSize(String filename) throws IOException {
        DataStorage dfs = pigContext.getDfs();
        ElementDescriptor elem = dfs.asElement(filename);
```
