This appears to be a merge conflict where one side added a serialVersionUID field while the other side added @Facebook annotated fields. Both changes appear to be complementary rather than conflicting since they serve different purposes. The version UID is useful for serialization while the code and message fields appear to be part of a data model.

Here's the resolved version that combines both changes:

```java

  }

  class DebugTokenError extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Facebook
    private Integer code;

    @Facebook
    private String message;

```
