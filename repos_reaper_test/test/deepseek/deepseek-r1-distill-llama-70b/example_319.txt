Here's the merged code snippet:

```java
        mResponse = null;
        return is;
    }

    public String asString() throws ResponseException {
    	if (TwitterApplication.DEBUG){
    		DebugTimer.betweenStart("AS STRING");
    	}
        String str = null;
        InputStream is = asStream();
        if (null == is) {
            return str;
```

The added debug timer check at the beginning of the method preserves the intent to measure performance in debug mode while maintaining the existing logic for converting the response to a string.
