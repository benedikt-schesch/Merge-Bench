I'll preserve the conflict since the intent of whether the method should be synchronized is ambiguous. The conflict is over whether the `subscribe` method should be synchronized. Here is the code with the conflict:

```java
		} catch (WifiStateException e1) {
			mInfo = null;
		}
		mSubscribers = new HashSet<Handler>();
	}
<<<<<<< HEAD
	
	public synchronized void subscribe(Handler handler) {
		Log.i("NowPlayingPoller", "Subscribing handler " + handler.getClass().getName() + " to now playing events.");
=======
	
	public void subscribe(Handler handler) {
>>>>>>> 3714d4e47f47c4d640239dfe025a1ebf91b3b624
		// update handler on the state of affairs
		final ICurrentlyPlaying currPlaying = mControl.getCurrentlyPlaying(mManagerStub);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_PROGRESS_CHANGED, currPlaying);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_PLAYLIST_ITEM_CHANGED, currPlaying);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_COVER_CHANGED, currPlaying);
```
