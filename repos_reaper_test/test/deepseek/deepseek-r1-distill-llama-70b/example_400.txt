I'll preserve the context and help resolve the merge conflict by combining both changes since they appear to be adding different protected fields. Here's the resolved code:

```java
	protected MessageBusConnection messageBusConnection;
	protected ProjectFileIndex projectFileIndex;
	protected ProjectRootManager projectRootManager; 
	
	protected InfinitestLauncher launcher;
	protected ModuleRootManager moduleRootManager;
	protected ModuleSettings moduleSettings;
	protected RuntimeEnvironment runtimeEnvironment;
	protected ProjectTestControl control;
	protected InfinitestAnnotator annotator;
	
	@BeforeEach
	public void setupIntellijMockBase() {
```

The resolution combines both changes by including all the protected fields from both versions of the code. This maintains the functionality from both branches while preserving the original context and formatting.
