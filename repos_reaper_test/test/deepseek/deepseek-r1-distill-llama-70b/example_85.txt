The snippet contains a merge conflict between two different Set types. The HEAD branch uses `CustomBlackCard` and `CustomWhiteCard`, while the other branch uses `CardcastBlackCard` and `CardcastWhiteCard`. Without additional context, it's unclear which type is intended to be used. The conflict remains unresolved.

```java
public class CustomDeck extends CardSet {
  private final int id;
  private final String name;
  private final String watermark;
  private final String description;
<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomDeck.java
  private final Set<CustomBlackCard> blackCards = new HashSet<>();
  private final Set<CustomWhiteCard> whiteCards = new HashSet<>();

  private final Set<CardcastBlackCard> blackCards = new HashSet<>();
  private final Set<CardcastWhiteCard> whiteCards = new HashSet<>();
