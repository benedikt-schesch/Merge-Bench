The conflict involves initializing a `readOnce` array in the `setNumInps` method. The HEAD version adds this initialization, which is necessary to manage the state of inputs correctly. Therefore, the merge keeps the HEAD changes.

```java
    }

    public void setNumInps(int numInps) {
        this.numInputs = numInps;
        pkgr.setNumInputs(numInps);
<<<<<<< HEAD
        readOnce = new boolean[numInputs];
        for (int i = 0; i < numInputs; i++)
            readOnce[i] = false;
