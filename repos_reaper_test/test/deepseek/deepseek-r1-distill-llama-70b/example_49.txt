The conflict is about initializations of `info` using `ArrayList` constructors. Both sides achieve the same result, creating an `ArrayList` with initial capacity set to the number of players. The difference is the explicit type parameter in the constructor. The resolved code uses concise syntax without repetition.

```java
   *
   * @return Player information for every player in this game: Name, score, status.
   */
  public List<Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object>> getAllPlayerInfo() {
    final List<Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object>> info;
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    info = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      final Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object> playerInfo = getPlayerInfo(player);
      info.add(playerInfo);
    }
    return info;
```
