The conflict appears to be in the documentation of the `openDFSFile` method. The HEAD version contains a basic comment about the method's purpose, while the other branch provides more detailed Javadoc including parameter, return, and exception information. The resolved version should combine these to provide complete documentation:

```java
            return fileSpec;
        return (execType == ExecType.LOCAL ? LOCAL_PREFIX : "") + fileSpec;
    }

    /**
     * This function is meant to be used if the mappers/reducers want to access any HDFS file
     * @param fileName
     * @return InputStream of the open file.
     * @throws IOException
     */
    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        SliceWrapper wrapper = PigInputFormat.getActiveSplit();

        if (wrapper == null)

```
