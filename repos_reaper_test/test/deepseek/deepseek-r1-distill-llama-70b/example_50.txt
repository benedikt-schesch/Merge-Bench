The conflict is in the static initializer where both sides are initializing the `FINITE_PLAYTIMES` set with the same elements, just using slightly different syntax. The semantics are identical - both are creating an unmodifiable set of the same string elements.

I'll preserve the simpler and more modern Java syntax from the 5adedd24 side that uses the diamond operator and varargs directly:

```java
  private final static int JUDGE_TIMEOUT_PER_CARD = 7 * 1000;
  private final static int MAX_SKIPS_BEFORE_KICK = 2;
  private final static Set<String> FINITE_PLAYTIMES;

  static {
    final Set<String> finitePlaytimes = new TreeSet<>(Arrays.asList("0.25x", "0.5x", "0.75x", "1x", "1.25x", "1.5x", "1.75x", "2x", "2.5x", "3x", "4x", "5x", "10x"));
    FINITE_PLAYTIMES = Collections.unmodifiableSet(finitePlaytimes);
  }

  private final int id;
  /**
