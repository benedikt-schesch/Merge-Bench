The conflict is about a trivial difference in the error message's trailing space. Both versions are functionally the same, so we can choose the version without the trailing space for consistency.

```java
        if (language != null) {
            if ("swagger".equals(language)) {
                definition = SwaggerUtils
                        .getDefinition(defSource, ulogin, upwd);
            } else {
                failWithErrorMessage("The language " + language + " is not currently supported. ");
