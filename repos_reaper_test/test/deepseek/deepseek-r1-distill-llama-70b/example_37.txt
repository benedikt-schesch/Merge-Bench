The conflict is between two different import statements for command line interface (CLI) building in Airlift. The choice between `buildCli` and `singleCommand` depends on whether we need a multi-command CLI (`buildCli`) or a single-command CLI (`singleCommand`).

Given the context is a `HelpTest` class, we can assume we're testing help functionality which would work with either single or multiple commands. However, since the test class is empty, we can't determine the actual intent. I'll preserve the conflict:

```java
import io.airlift.command.command.CommandRemove;

import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;
