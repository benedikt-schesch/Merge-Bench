Here's the conflict resolution where both changes are merged together since they serve different purposes:

```java
    private PageStartDate date;
  }

  public static class PageStartDate extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private Integer year;
```
