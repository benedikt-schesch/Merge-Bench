The conflict is about the style of initializing a HashMap. One side uses explicit type parameters, while the other uses the diamond operator. Both achieve the same result, but the diamond operator is preferred in modern Java as it is more concise and relies on type inference.

Here is the resolve with the diamond operator style:

```java

      synchronized (roundPlayers) {
        for (final Player player : roundPlayers) {
          final List<WhiteCard> cards = playedCards.getCards(player);
          if (cards == null || cards.size() < blackCard.getPick()) {
            final Map<ReturnableData, Object> data = new HashMap<>();
            data.put(LongPollResponse.EVENT, LongPollEvent.HURRY_UP.toString());
            data.put(LongPollResponse.GAME_ID, this.id);
            final QueuedMessage q = new QueuedMessage(MessageType.GAME_EVENT, data);
            player.getUser().enqueueMessage(q);
          }
```

I chose the diamond operator style (`new HashMap<>();`) as it is the more modern Java syntax, is less verbose, and maintains type safety through the variable declaration. Both styles are semantically equivalent - they create an empty HashMap with the same types.
