To resolve this merge conflict, we need to ensure both methods are correctly incorporated into the final code. Here's how the code should be structured, maintaining both methods without conflicts:

```java
                }
            }
        }
    }

    /**
     * Used to get the compiled plan
     * @return map reduce plan built by the compiler
     */
    public MROperPlan getMRPlan() {
        // Implementation of getMRPlan method
    }

    public void randomizeFileLocalizer(){
        FileLocalizer.setR(new Random());
    }
```

Or, if the order is important, the methods can be placed in the reverse order. The key is to ensure both methods are present and the syntax is correct.
