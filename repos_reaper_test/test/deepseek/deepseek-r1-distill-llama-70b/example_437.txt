I cannot resolve this conflict as the intent is ambiguous. Both branches are trying to achieve a refresh of subcategories after an update, but they approach it differently and may have different implications for the UI state. The original context is preserved:

```java
                        if (getActivity() == null) return;

                        Toast.makeText(getActivity(), getString(R.string.update_complete),
                                Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();

<<<<<<< HEAD
                        refreshSubCategories();

                        mAdapter.notifyArrayItemRangeChanged(0, mAdapter.size());
=======
                        rebuildSubCategories();

                        reloadAdapters();

                        updateRecommendations();
                    }

                    @Override

```
