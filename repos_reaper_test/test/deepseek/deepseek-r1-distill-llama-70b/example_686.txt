The conflict appears to be about how to format and present a warning message for ambiguous principals. Both versions aim to inform users about ambiguous names that could not be resolved during deployment.

The key differences:
1. The wording in the warning message ("grants or node ownership" vs "resource access permissions or node ownership")
2. The addition of an exclamation mark in one version
3. The sorting of the ambiguous principals list in one version

The intent appears to be to warn users about ambiguous principals while presenting the information clearly. The version in the commit (83418dbb) seems preferable since:
- It uses "grants or node ownership" which may be more precise
- It sorts the list of ambiguous principals for better readability
- It adds an exclamation mark to emphasize the warning

Here is the resolved version:

```java
		}

		if (!ambiguousPrincipals.isEmpty()) {

			final String title = "Ambiguous Principal(s)";
			final String text = "For the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for grants or node ownership during <b>data deployment</b>.<br>"
					+ "Because of this ambiguity, <b>node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported</b>!"
					+ "<ul><li>" + ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>")) + "</li></ul>"
					+ "Consider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.";
