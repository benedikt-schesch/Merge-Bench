To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent and functionality behind each change. The HEAD branch uses a stream with specific offsets, which is more efficient for large content, while the other branch uses a reader but relies on an undefined `json` variable. Since `json` isn't defined, the HEAD's approach is more robust and self-contained.

```java

    public <T> T unmarshall(DBObject document, Class<T> clazz) throws MarshallingException {

        DocumentStream stream = DocumentStreamFactory.fromDBObject(document);
        try {
            return mapper.readValue(stream.getData(), stream.getOffset(), stream.getSize(), clazz);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            String message = String.format("Unable to unmarshall result to %s from content %s", clazz, document.toString());
            throw new MarshallingException(message, e);
        }
    }

    public DBObject marshall(Object obj) throws MarshallingException {
