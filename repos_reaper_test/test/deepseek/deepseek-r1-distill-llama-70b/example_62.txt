Since the visible content of the logger.info statement is identical between both versions (one is just split across two lines for readability), I will keep the version from HEAD as it maintains better code formatting practices by splitting the long string. Here is the resolved code:

```java

    synchronized (playedCards) {
      if (state == GameState.PLAYING || playersToRemove.size() == 0) {
        // not sure how much of this check is actually required
        if (players.size() < 3 || playedCards.size() < 2) {
          logger.info(String.format(
              "Resetting game %d due to insufficient players after removing %d idle players.",
              id, playersToRemove.size()));
          resetState(true);
        } else {
          judgingState();
        }
      }
```
