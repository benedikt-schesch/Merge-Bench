I cannot resolve this conflict because the intent is ambiguous. The choice between `BitmapTexture` and `BitmapTextureAtlas` depends on the specific requirements of the codebase.

Here is the preserved conflict:

```java
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private int mFaceIDCounter;
	private final SparseArray<Sprite> mFaces = new SparseArray<Sprite>();
```
