The merge conflict in this case is non-functional, as both versions of the code achieve the same result with only a stylistic difference in formatting. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by selecting either version. Here is the resolved code:

```java
   *
   * @param data A map of data being returned to a client request.
   */
  public void maybeAddPermalinkToData(final Map<ReturnableData, Object> data) {
    if (showGameLinkProvider.get() && null != currentUniqueId) {
      data.put(AjaxResponse.GAME_PERMALINK, String.format(gamePermalinkFormatProvider.get(), currentUniqueId));
    }
  }

  /**
   * Add a player to the game.
```
