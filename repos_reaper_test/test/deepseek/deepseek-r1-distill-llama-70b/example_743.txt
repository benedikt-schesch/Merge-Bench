The conflict is purely about code formatting, with both conditions being logically identical. I'll choose the version from HEAD for conciseness.

```java
                continue;
            }

            if (widget.getY() < tested.getFinalY() + tested.getMeasuredHeight()) {
                // Don't try to go before the first if we're already it
                if (isFirst && widget.getY() + widget.getHeight() < tested.getFinalY() - tested.getHeight() / 2)
                    break;

                // Move the widget in our list
                mOpenWidgets.remove(widget);
                mOpenWidgets.add(i, widget);
```
