The conflict is due to differing indentation of the same code line. Both sides are attempting to call `MapRedUtil.setupUDFContext(jConf)` but with different indentation levels. The version in HEAD (4 spaces) is correctly aligned with the surrounding context, while the other version (8 spaces) is over-indented.

```java
                    roots = rp.getRoots().toArray(new PhysicalOperator[1]);
                    leaf = rp.getLeaves().get(0);
                }

                // Get the UDF specific context
                MapRedUtil.setupUDFContext(jConf);

            } catch (IOException ioe) {
                String msg = "Problem while configuring reduce plan.";
                throw new RuntimeException(msg, ioe);
            }
```
