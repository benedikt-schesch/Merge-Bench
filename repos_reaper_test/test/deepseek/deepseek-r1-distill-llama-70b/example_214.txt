I will resolve the conflict by preserving the method name and exception handling that appears to match the test's intent. The test appears to be focused on simple counting functionality based on the code implementation.

```java
        tmpFile.delete();
        
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testSimpleCount() throws Exception {
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
        for (int i = 0; i < nullFlags.length; i++) {
            System.err.println("Testing testSimpleCount with null flag:" + nullFlags[i]);
        
            PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(tmpFile));
```
