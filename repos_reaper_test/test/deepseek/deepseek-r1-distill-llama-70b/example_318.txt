The conflict is resolved by selecting the line from the other branch, assuming that `StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED` is the correct and updated constant to use. This aligns with the project's structure where database constants are managed through the `StatusTable` class.

```java
			mSourceColumn = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_SOURCE);
			mInReplyToScreenName = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_IN_REPLY_TO_SCREEN_NAME);
			mFavorited = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED);
		} 
		mMetaBuilder = new StringBuilder();
	}

	private LayoutInflater mInflater;
