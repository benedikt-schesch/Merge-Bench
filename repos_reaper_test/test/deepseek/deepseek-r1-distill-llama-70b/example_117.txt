I'll preserve the conflict since the intent between using branch name vs commit SHA isn't clear. Here is the code snippet with the conflict:

```java
  private void openCommits() {
    if (selectedBranch != null) {
      RepoInfo repoInfo = new RepoInfo();
      repoInfo.owner = repo.getOwner().getLogin();
      repoInfo.name = repo.name;
<<<<<<< HEAD
      repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getName();
=======
      repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getCommit().getSha();
>>>>>>> 42bfc423b52bed1c5d64d35cc1100a32b48968d6
      Intent intent = BranchCommitsActivity.createLauncherIntent(this, repoInfo);
      startActivity(intent);
    }
  }
```
