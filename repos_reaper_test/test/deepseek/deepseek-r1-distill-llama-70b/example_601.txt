I cannot resolve this conflict definitively as the intent is ambiguous. Both sides appear to be trying to create a JsonObject from a string value, but they use different approaches:

1. The HEAD version uses `Json.parse().asObject()` which suggests using a JSON parsing approach
2. The commit a17acec version uses `new JsonObject(value)` which suggests a constructor-based approach

Without knowing which JSON library/implementation is being used, I cannot determine which approach is correct. I will return the snippet with the conflict:

```java
     * May throw a JsonException
     * 
     * @return
     */
    public JsonObject getValueAsJsonObject() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      return Json.parse(value).asObject();
=======
      return new JsonObject(value);
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    }
  }
