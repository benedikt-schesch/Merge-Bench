I cannot resolve this merge conflict because it appears to involve a change in the type of a class field from `BuildableBitmapTexture` to `BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas`. The naming and functionality of these classes suggest they could be related but distinct implementations, and without more context about how these classes are used in the rest of the codebase, it's ambiguous which version is correct.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;
<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BuildableBitmapTexture mBuildableTexture;
=======
	private BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas mBuildableBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private BaseTextureRegion[] mSVGTestTextureRegions;

	// ===========================================================
	// Constructors
	// ===========================================================
