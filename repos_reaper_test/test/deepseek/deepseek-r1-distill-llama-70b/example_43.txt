I will leave the snippet with the conflict unresolved since the intent is ambiguous without knowing whether the field is named `spectator` or `spectators`. Here is the code with the conflict:

```java
  }

  /**
   * Remove a spectator from the game.
   * <br/>
<<<<<<< HEAD
   * Synchronizes on {@link #spectator}.
=======
   * Synchronizes on {@link #spectators}.
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
   *
   * @param user Spectator to remove from the game.
   */
  public void removeSpectator(final User user) {
    logger.info(String.format("Removing spectator %s from game %d.", user.toString(), id));
```
