The conflict appears to resolve around differences in how the JSON response is being processed and stored. The key differences are:

1. `jsonObject.get("data").asArray()` vs `jsonObject.getJsonArray("data")`
2. Using a new `dataItem` list vs using an existing `dataList` 
3. Small differences in how the casting and conversion is being done inside the loop

Here is the reconciled version that tries to maintain the intent:

```java
    } catch (ParseException e) {
      throw new FacebookJsonMappingException("The connection JSON you provided was invalid: " + json, e);
    }

    // Pull out data
    JsonArray jsonData = jsonObject.getJsonArray("data");
    for (int i = 0; i < jsonData.size(); i++) {
      dataList.add(connectionType.equals(JsonObject.class) ? (T) jsonData.get(i)
          : facebookClient.getJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonData.get(i).toString(), connectionType));
    }

    // Pull out paging info, if present
    if (jsonObject.get("paging") != null) {
```

I chose this version because:
1. It uses `getJsonArray()` which is more direct and consistent with the following code
2. It maintains the existing `dataList` which suggests this is the intended collection to be populated
3. The casting and conversion logic is simplified
4. It removes the redundant list initialization that was only in one version

The changes maintain the core functionality while choosing the more consistent and simplified approach.
