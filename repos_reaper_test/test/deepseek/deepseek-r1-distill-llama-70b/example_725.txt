I see a merge conflict between two versions of the interface definition. The original (HEAD) version is:

```java
public interface ABActivityViewer{
```

While the other version (a4d77b017980dbe4d731dc090d4cd8cd3c2d9364) is:

```java
public interface ABActivityViewer extends TaskController{
```

The intent seems to be to have the interface extend TaskController in the new version, while the original version does not extend anything. Since this appears to be a deliberate change to add the TaskController extension, I will preserve this change in the resolution.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
 * Date: 7/17/14.
 * <p/>
 * MVP的View层，UI相关，Activity需要实现该interface
 * 它会包含一个Presenter的引用，当有事件发生（比如按钮点击后），会调用Presenter层的方法
 */
public interface ABActivityViewer extends TaskController{
    /**
     * 显示Toast信息
     *
     * @param message
     */
```
