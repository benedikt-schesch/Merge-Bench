The conflict involves whether the `deserializeObject` method should have three parameters (including `rpcid`) and be an instance method, or have only two parameters and be a static method. The parameter `rpcid` is not used within the method's implementation.

Considering that the `rpcid` parameter isn't utilized in the method's functionality, the version with fewer parameters is more appropriate. Additionally, making the method `static` aligns with it being a utility method that doesn't depend on instance state.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
   * De-serializes a "Writable" serialized by
   * {@code HbaseObjectWritable#writeObject}.
   * @return The de-serialized object (which can be {@code null}).
   */
  @SuppressWarnings("fallthrough")
  static Object deserializeObject(final ChannelBuffer buf,
                                  final HBaseRpc request) {
    switch (buf.readByte()) {  // Read the type of the response.
      case  1:  // Boolean
        return buf.readByte() != 0x00;
      case  6:  // Long
        return buf.readLong();
```
