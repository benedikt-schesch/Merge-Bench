Here is the resolved code:

```java
    private boolean fromPaginated;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        loadArguments();
        if (autoStart()) {
            executeRequest();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreateView(inflater, container, savedInstanceState);
```

The merge combines both changes since they appear to have the same intent of adding functionality to the onCreate method. The original loadArguments() call is preserved, and the additional autoStart() check with executeRequest() is included.
