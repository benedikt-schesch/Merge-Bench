Here's the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved:

```java
	private Stream resultStream;

	private Instances dataset;

	public ClassOption learnerOption = new ClassOption("learner", 'l',
<<<<<<< HEAD
			"Classifier to train.", LocalClassifierAdapter.class, SimpleClassifierAdapter.class.getName());
=======
			"Classifier to train.", LocalLearner.class, SimpleClassifierAdapter.class.getName());
>>>>>>> 40d31d67633f703171421ba4d73bb421d89a32db6
	private TopologyBuilder builder;

	private int parallelism;
```

The conflict shows a potential refactoring of the class name used in the `ClassOption` constructor. The left side uses `LocalClassifierAdapter.class` while the right side uses `LocalLearner.class`. Both versions are preserved in the code block above. Depending on which class name is correct in the current context (i.e., if `LocalLearner` is a new class that replaces `LocalClassifierAdapter`), you would choose one or the other.
