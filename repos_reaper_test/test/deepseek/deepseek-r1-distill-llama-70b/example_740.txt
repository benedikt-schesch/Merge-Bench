The conflict is due to formatting differences in the calculation of the `x` coordinate. Both versions perform the same calculation but have different code formatting for the `x` coordinate. The HEAD version is on a single line, while the other branch has improved formatting with better line breaks for readability. I'll keep the version with better formatting.

```java

            final float radAngle = (float) ((i * (180.0f / 4.0f) + 90.0f) * Math.PI / 180.0f);

            final float y = (float) (height + ringRadius * Math.cos(radAngle) - mButtonSize);
            // We remove the button edge
            final float x = (float) (width / 2 - button.mNormalBitmap.getWidth() / 2
                    - ringRadius * Math.sin(radAngle));

            canvas.save();
            canvas.translate(x + button.mNormalBitmap.getWidth() / 2,
                    y + button.mNormalBitmap.getWidth() / 2);
            canvas.rotate(mCurrentOrientation);
