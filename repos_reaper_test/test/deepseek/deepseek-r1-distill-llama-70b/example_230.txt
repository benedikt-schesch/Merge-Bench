The conflict is between two ways of constructing a load statement. The HEAD version uses `file:` protocol with `Util.encodeEscape`, while the repository version uses `Util.generateURI` without the `file:` prefix.

Looking at the intent:
1. Both sides aim to load the file in a Pig query
2. Repository version is more explicit about using the correct URI encoding
3. `file:` protocol may not be needed when using `generateURI`
4. `Util.generateURI` is likely a utility that abstracts the proper way to create URIs

Here is the resolved version using the repository's intent while preserving context:

```java
        PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(tmpFile));
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            ps.println(i+"\t"+i);
        }
        ps.close();
        //Load, Execute and Store query
        String query = "foreach (load '"+Util.generateURI(tmpFile.toString())+"') generate $0,$1;";
        System.out.println(query);
        pig.registerQuery("asdf_id = " + query);
        try {
            pig.deleteFile("frog");
        } catch(Exception e) {}
```
