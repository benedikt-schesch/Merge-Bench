In this case, the conflict is between using `textParts.size()` and `textParts.length()`. The `JSONArray` class in Java typically uses the `length()` method rather than `size()`, so the change to use `length()` is more appropriate.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml11(text);
  }

  public static String formatWhiteCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // The white cards should only ever have one element in text, but let's be safe.
    final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());
    for (final Object o : textParts) {
      final String cardCastString = (String) o;
      if (cardCastString.isEmpty()) {
        // skip blank segments
        continue;
```
