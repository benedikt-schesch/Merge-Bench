I'll preserve the context and resolve the merge by semantically combining both sides. The conflict appears to be adding a private method `getPigContext()` that was missing in HEAD. The other branch added this method with the `@Private` annotation, which likely was intended to be the `private` access modifier (note the syntax error with the @ symbol). I will fix the syntax error while preserving the intent.

```java
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    private
    public PigContext getPigContext() {
        return pigContext;
    }

    public void start() {
        startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        userId = System.getProperty("user.name");
    }
```
