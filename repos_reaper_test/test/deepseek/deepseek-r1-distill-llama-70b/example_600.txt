Here's the merged code that preserves both changes:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class Settings extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String setting;


```

I've merged the changes by:
1. Keeping the `serialVersionUID` from the HEAD branch
2. Adding the new `@Facebook` field with its annotations from the other branch
3. Preserving the original formatting and spacing
4. Maintaining the logical order of class members (metadata first, then fields)
