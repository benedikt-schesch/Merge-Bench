Okay, I need to help resolve this merge conflict in the Java code. Let me look at the code snippets.

On the HEAD branch, there's a serialVersionUID field, which is important for serialization. On the other branch, there's a Javadoc comment for the getLower() method. Both are useful, so I'll include both in the merged code.

Here's the resolved code:

```java

  }

  public static class AgeRange extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * The lower bounds of the range for this person's age.
     * 
     * @return The lower bounds of the range for this person's age.
     */

```
