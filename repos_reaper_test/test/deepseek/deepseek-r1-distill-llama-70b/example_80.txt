Here's the code snippet with the conflicting lines preserved:

```java
   */
  public interface DoubleLocalizable {
    /**
     * @return The first user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    public String getString();
=======
    String getString();
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a

    /**
     * @return The second user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     */
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

The conflict is about whether the `getString()` method should be declared as `public String getString()` (HEAD version) or `String getString()` (other version). Both versions are functionally equivalent since interface methods are implicitly public in Java. The difference is purely stylistic - whether to explicitly include the `public` keyword.
