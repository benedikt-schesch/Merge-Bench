I'll analyze the merge conflict and resolve it by preserving the changes from both sides while maintaining their semantic meaning.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
    static final int DIALOG_MESSAGE_CLICK = 25;
    static final int DIALOG_GOTO_PARENT = 28;
    static final int DIALOG_EDIT = 29;
    static final int DIALOG_DELETE = 30;
    static final int DIALOG_COMPOSE = 31;
    static final int DIALOG_FIND = 32;
    static final int DIALOG_REPORT = 33;
    static final int DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK = 34;
    static final int DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE = 35;

    // progress dialogs
    static final int DIALOG_LOGGING_IN = 1000;
    static final int DIALOG_SUBMITTING = 1004;
    static final int DIALOG_REPLYING = 1005;
```

The resolution combines both sides of the conflict by including all dialog constants. The numbering has been preserved in a continuous sequence, and all dialog identifiers from both sides have been incorporated in a single block.
