To resolve this merge conflict, we need to understand the intent of each change and determine the most appropriate solution.

**Conflict Analysis**:
- The code in the `HEAD` branch directly draws the `scene.viewport.bitmap` onto the canvas using `canvas.drawBitmap()`
- The code in the other branch instead calls `scene.draw(canvas)`
- Both approaches achieve the goal of rendering the scene, but they do so differently:
  - `canvas.drawBitmap()` is a direct bitmap drawing operation
  - `scene.draw(canvas)` suggests that the Scene class has its own drawing logic that might handle transformations, compositing, and other operations internally

**Resolution**:
Based on the code context and the likelihood that `scene.draw()` encapsulates more sophisticated rendering logic, we'll keep the `scene.draw(canvas)` version as it likely provides better encapsulation and potentially more complete rendering functionality.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
		// tell the scene to update it's viewport bitmap
		scene.update();
		
		// draw it
		scene.draw(canvas);
    	if (DEBUG){
    		long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
			double n = ((double)now)/1000L;
			double s = ((double)startTime)/1000L;
			double fps = 1L/(n-s);
```
