The conflict arises because one version includes the necessary closing brace after the return statement, while the other does not. Including the brace correctly ends the method.

```java
        if (wrapper == null)
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "can't open DFS file while executing locally");
        
        return openDFSFile(fileName, ConfigurationUtil.toProperties(wrapper.getJobConf()));
    }

    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName, Properties properties) throws IOException{
        DataStorage dds = new HDataStorage(properties);
        ElementDescriptor elem = dds.asElement(fileName);
```
