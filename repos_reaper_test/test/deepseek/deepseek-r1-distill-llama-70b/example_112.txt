Alright, let's break this down. We have a merge conflict in the Javadoc author section of a Java file. Both sides are trying to add or modify the author list. The key is to preserve all legitimate contributors without duplication.

1. **Identify Changes**:
   - **HEAD** adds two authors: Nicolas François and Mikhail Mazursky.
   - **Other branch** only includes Nicolas François.

2. **Determine Intent**:
   - Both sides agree that Nicolas François is an author.
   - HEAD includes an additional author, Mikhail Mazursky, which the other branch doesn't have.

3. **Resolve Conflict**:
   - Since the intent seems to be adding Mikhail in HEAD, we'll include both to ensure all contributors are credited.

**Final Decision**: Merge both changes by including all authors.

```java
 * @author Yvonne Wang
 * @author Alex Ruiz
 * @author Mathieu Baechler
 * @author Joel Costigliola
 * @author Maciej Jaskowski
 * @author Nicolas François 
 * @author Mikhail Mazursky
