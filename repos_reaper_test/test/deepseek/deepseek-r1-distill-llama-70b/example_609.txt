Here is the resolved merge conflict based on the intent of both sides:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageStartInfo extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String type;


```

The conflict was resolved by preserving the `serialVersionUID` from the HEAD branch and incorporating the new field with annotations from the other branch. The changes are complementary and serve different purposes, so both were preserved in the resolution.
