The conflict is about initializing an ArrayList with or without explicit type parameters. Both do the same thing, but the diamond operator is more concise. I'll keep the version with the diamond operator.

```java
      synchronized (players) {
        for (final Player player : players) {
          if (getJudge() == player) {
            continue;
          }
          final List<WhiteCard> cards = new ArrayList<>(newBlackCard.getDraw());
          for (int i = 0; i < newBlackCard.getDraw(); i++) {
            cards.add(getNextWhiteCard());
          }
          player.getHand().addAll(cards);
          sendCardsToPlayer(player, cards);
```
