To resolve the merge conflict, we need to focus on the key differences between the two versions:

1. **Access Modifier**: The original version (HEAD) uses `void` while the other version (ee2493156) uses `public void`.
2. **Typo Correction**: The original version has a typo in `prepateCore` while the other version corrects it to `prepareCore`.

The corrected version should:
- Keep the original access modifier as `void` since it's conventional for JUnit tests and works correctly.
- Fix the typo to ensure the correct method is called.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
		assertEquals(1, updates);
		verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));
	}

	@Test
	void shouldUpdateCoreOnAutoBuild() throws CoreException {
		InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 10);

		workspace.updateProjects(Collections.singleton(resource));

		assertStatusIs(findingTests(0, projects.size(), 0));
		verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));

```
