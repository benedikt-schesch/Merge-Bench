This conflict arises from two different sources for the `this.data` assignment. The correct choice is `dataList` as it's likely the intended collection.

```java
      totalCount = jsonSummary.get("total_count") != null ? jsonSummary.getLong("total_count", 0L) : null;
    } else {
      totalCount = null;
    }

    this.data = unmodifiableList(dataList);
    this.facebookClient = facebookClient;
    this.connectionType = connectionType;
  }
