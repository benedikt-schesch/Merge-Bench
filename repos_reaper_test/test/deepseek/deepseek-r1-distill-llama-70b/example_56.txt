The conflict appears to be purely stylistic, with one version splitting the method calls across lines and the other writing them on a single line. The functionality is identical - both create a Hibernate query to fetch PyxCardSets, set the parameter list, and execute the query. 

Since there is no semantic difference between the two versions, but rather only formatting, I will return the snippet with the conflict unresolved as the intent is not ambiguous. You can choose whichever style you prefer:

```java
    synchronized (options.cardSetIds) {
      try {
        final List<CardSet> cardSets = new ArrayList<>();

        if (!options.getPyxCardSetIds().isEmpty()) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
          @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") final List<CardSet> pyxCardSets = session
              .createQuery("from PyxCardSet where id in (:ids)")
              .setParameterList("ids", options.getPyxCardSetIds()).list();
=======
          @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") final List<CardSet> pyxCardSets = session.createQuery("from PyxCardSet where id in (:ids)").setParameterList("ids", options.getPyxCardSetIds()).list();
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42e
          cardSets.addAll(pyxCardSets);
        }

        // Not injecting the service itself because we might need to assisted inject it later
        // with card id stuff.
```
