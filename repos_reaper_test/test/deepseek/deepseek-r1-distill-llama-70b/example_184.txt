The conflict is between using `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`. Both classes are used for string manipulation, but `StringBuilder` is more efficient when thread safety isn't needed, which appears to be the case here. I'll choose `StringBuilder` for better performance.

```java
            return;

        case STRING: {
            // Gather up all the remaining arguments into a string and pass them into
            // grunt.
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            String remainders[] = opts.getRemainingArgs();
            for (int i = 0; i < remainders.length; i++) {
                if (i != 0) sb.append(' ');
                sb.append(remainders[i]);
            }

```
