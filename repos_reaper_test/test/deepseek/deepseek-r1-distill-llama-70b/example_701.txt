The merge conflict appears to be between two different ways of handling a browser launch intent. The original code (HEAD) uses `startActivity` with an Intent, while the merge suggestion uses a utility method `Common.launchBrowser`.

Both options are semantically equivalent - they both attempt to launch a browser with the URL from `mOpThreadInfo.getURL()`. However, the `Common.launchBrowser` version is likely a refactor that centralizes browser launching logic in a utility method.

Given this is a refactor, I will preserve the merge version as it represents the newer implementation pattern:

```java
ัคร

			});
		} else {
			linkButton.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
				public void onClick(View v) {
					dismissDialog(Constants.DIALOG_THING_CLICK);
					Common.launchBrowser(mOpThreadInfo.getURL(), RedditCommentsListActivity.this);
				}
			});
		}
		linkButton.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
	}

```
