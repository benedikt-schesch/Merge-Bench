Since there is a clear intent from both sides of the merge to add different imports, we should preserve both sets of imports. The imports from HEAD and the imports from the other commit serve different purposes (Guava's immutable collections vs Guice dependency injection and GameOptions). There is no direct conflict between them.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

import javax.servlet.ServletContext;

import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;
import com.google.inject.*;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.GameOptions;
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.hibernate.Session;

import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableSet;
import com.google.inject.assistedinject.FactoryModuleBuilder;
```
