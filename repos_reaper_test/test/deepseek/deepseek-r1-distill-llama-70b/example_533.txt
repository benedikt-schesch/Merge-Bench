The conflict is due to a typo in the class name used for converting the InputStream to a byte array. `IOUtils` is the correct class from Apache Commons IO library, while `IOUtil` is likely a typo. Here's the resolved code:

```java
	 * 
	 * @param in The Resource's contents
	 * @param href The location of the resource within the epub. Example: "cover.jpg".
	 */
	public Resource(InputStream in, String href) throws IOException {
		this(null, IOUtils.toByteArray(in), href, MediatypeService.determineMediaType(href));
	}

    /**
     * Creates a Resource that tries to load the data, but falls back to lazy loading.
     *
```
