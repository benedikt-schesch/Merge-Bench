The conflict is between initializing a `HashMap` with explicit type parameters versus using the diamond operator. Both achieve the same result, but the diamond operator is more concise and preferred in modern Java.

   */
  public HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> getEventMap() {
    final HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> data = new HashMap<>();
    data.put(LongPollResponse.GAME_ID, id);
    return data;
  }
