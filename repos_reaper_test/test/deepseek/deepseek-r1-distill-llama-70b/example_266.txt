The conflict is about code style differences in the comments. The HEAD branch uses a block comment with line continuation, while the other branch uses separate line comments. Both achieve the same documentation purpose.

To resolve this, we'll preserve the block comment style for consistency with typical Java practices:

```java
 * it does not use the index in the NullableTuple to find the bag to put a
 * tuple in.  Instead, the inputs are put in a bag corresponding to their
 * offset in the tuple.

public class CombinerPackager extends Packager {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    private boolean[] mBags; // For each field, indicates whether or not it
                             // needs to be put in a bag.
    private Map<Integer, Integer> keyLookup;

    private int numBags;
