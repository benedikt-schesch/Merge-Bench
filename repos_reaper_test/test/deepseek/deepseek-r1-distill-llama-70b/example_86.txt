The code snippet contains a merge conflict where two different parameter lists are provided for the `updateGameSettings` method. One version includes `newMaxBlanks` while the other includes `newMaxSpectators`. Both versions are trying to update game settings but with different parameters. Since it's unclear which parameter should take precedence, I will return the snippet with the conflict intact. 

```java
  public String getPassword() {
    return password;
  }

  public void updateGameSettings(final int newScoreGoal, final int newMaxPlayers,
<<<<<<< HEAD
      final Set<CardSet> newCardSets, final int newMaxBlanks, final String newPassword,
      final boolean newUseTimer) {
=======
      final int newMaxSpectators,
      final Set<CardSet> newCardSets, final String newPassword, final boolean newUseTimer) {
>>>>>>> 4584f06e2583bffe4a97884c772d3190cc6348ba
    this.scoreGoal = newScoreGoal;
    this.maxPlayers = newMaxPlayers;
    this.maxSpectators = newMaxSpectators;
    synchronized (this.cardSets) {
      this.cardSets.clear();
```
