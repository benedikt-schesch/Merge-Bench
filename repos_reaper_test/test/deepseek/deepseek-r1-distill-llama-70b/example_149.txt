Here is the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "describe b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();

```

I resolved the conflict by preserving the version from the right side of the merge (with `myPig` as the second argument to `GruntParser`) since it appears to be adding functionality to use a specific Pig context (`myPig`). The left side version was more minimal and didn't include this additional context.
