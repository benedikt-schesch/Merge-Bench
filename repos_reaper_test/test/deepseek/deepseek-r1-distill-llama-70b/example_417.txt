Here is the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved:

```java
package org.jbake.app;

import org.jbake.TestUtils;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.ConfigUtil;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.DefaultJBakeConfiguration;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
=======
import org.jbake.app.configuration.PropertyList;
>>>>>>> d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb
import org.json.simple.JSONArray;
import org.json.simple.JSONObject;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Rule;
```

The conflict appears to be about which import statements to include. The left side (HEAD) wants to import `JBakeProperty` and `DocumentModel`, while the right side wants to import `PropertyList`. Since I don't have enough context to determine which import is correct, I've preserved the conflict in the snippet. You'll need to decide which imports to keep based on the actual requirements of your code.
