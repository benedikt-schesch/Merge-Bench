The merge conflict appears to be related to differing imports for JUnit annotations. One side is importing JUnit 5 annotations while the other side is importing JUnit 4 annotations. Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.verify;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.Collections;
<<<<<<< HEAD

import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
=======
import java.util.Set;

import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586

import com.fakeco.fakeproduct.FakeProduct;

class ClassFileIndexTest {
	private ClassFileIndex index;

```

This conflict suggests that one branch may be upgrading to JUnit 5 while another branch is maintaining JUnit 4. To resolve this, you would need to decide whether to use JUnit 4 or JUnit 5 for your test class. The rest of the imports and class structure would need to be aligned with that decision.
