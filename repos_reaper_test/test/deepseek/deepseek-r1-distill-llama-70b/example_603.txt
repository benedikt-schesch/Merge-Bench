To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine which method call correctly retrieves the JSON data. The `getJsonObject` method is more appropriate when expecting a JSON object, ensuring proper data handling.

```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    String picJson = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString();
=======
    String picJson = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString();
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    picture = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(picJson, ProfilePictureSource.class);
  }

  @JsonMappingCompleted
  protected void graphApi26LikesFallback() {
```

The conflict was resolved by selecting `rawPicture.getJsonObject("data")` as it correctly retrieves the JSON object, aligning with the intent to parse structured data into `ProfilePictureSource`.
