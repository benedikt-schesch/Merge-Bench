The conflict is between two different ways of creating an empty array for the `toArray()` method and initializing an ArrayList. The core logic to collect spectator nicknames is identical in both versions.

The right side version is more idiomatic and efficient:
1. Using `new User[0]` instead of `new User[spectators.size()]` to create an empty array is more efficient as it avoids creating an intermediate array of the wrong size
2. Using the diamond operator `<>` to infer the ArrayList type is cleaner

Here is the resolved code:

```java
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      playerNames.add(player.getUser().getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.PLAYERS, playerNames);

    final User[] spectatorsCopy = spectators.toArray(new User[0]);
    final List<String> spectatorNames = new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length);
    for (final User spectator : spectatorsCopy) {
      spectatorNames.add(spectator.getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.SPECTATORS, spectatorNames);
```
