To resolve this merge conflict, we need to consider the intent and semantics of both sides. The original code has a test method `emptyFacebookMap()` while the merged branch has a test method `emptyObject()`. Both methods are testing the same functionality but with different method names. The new method name seems more generic and descriptive.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
    ListObject obj = new ListObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }

  /**
   * Can we handle the empty object?
   */
  @Test
  public void emptyObject() {
    MapObject obj = new MapObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }
```
