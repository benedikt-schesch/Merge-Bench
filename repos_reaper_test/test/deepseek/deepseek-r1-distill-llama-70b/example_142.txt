To resolve this merge conflict, we need to consider the differences between both versions of the code:

1. The method parameter type differs between the two versions:
   - `MiniGenericCluster` in HEAD
   - `MiniCluster` in the other branch

2. The other branch (8923da8) adds Windows-specific path handling that replaces backslashes with forward slashes.

The Windows path handling is a clear improvement to the functionality, so we should preserve that change. Since `MiniCluster` appears to be the newer type, we'll use that instead of `MiniGenericCluster`.

Here's the merged version:

```java
	static public void copyFromClusterToLocal(MiniCluster cluster, String fileNameOnCluster, String localFileName) throws IOException {
        if(Util.WINDOWS){
            fileNameOnCluster = fileNameOnCluster.replace('\\','/');
            localFileName = localFileName.replace('\\','/');
        }
	    File parent = new File(localFileName).getParentFile();
	    if (!parent.exists()) {
	        parent.mkdirs();
	    }
	    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(localFileName));
```
