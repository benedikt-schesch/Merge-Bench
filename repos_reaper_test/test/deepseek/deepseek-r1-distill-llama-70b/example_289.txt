The conflict appears to be about initializing variables before creating DataBags. The other branch adds `numInputs` and `readOnce` initialization, which the HEAD does not have, while the HEAD initializes `dbs` which the other branch does not have. The intention is likely to include all of these initializations together.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                if (bagType != null && bagType.equalsIgnoreCase("default")) {
                    useDefaultBag = true;
                }
            }
        }
        int numInputs = pkgr.getNumInputs(keyWritable.getIndex());
        boolean[] readOnce = new boolean[numInputs];
        for (int i = 0; i < numInputs; i++)
            readOnce[i] = false;

        if (isInputAttached()) {
            // Create numInputs bags
            DataBag[] dbs = null;
            dbs = new DataBag[numInputs];
            DataBag[] dbs = null;
            dbs = new DataBag[numInputs];
```

However, I notice that there is a duplicate initialization of `dbs`. If this is intentional, it stays. Otherwise, it should be removed.
