I'll preserve the conflict since the changes appear to be intentional and the intent is ambiguous. The main differences are:

1. `helpRequested` vs `helpNeeded` 
2. `isBake()` vs `isListConfig()`

Here is the preserved conflict:

```java
    public String getConfigValue() {
        return config;
    }

    public boolean isHelpNeeded() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        return helpRequested || !(isBake() || isRunServer() || isInit() || source != null || destination != null);
=======
        return helpNeeded || !(isListConfig() || isBake() || isRunServer() || isInit() || source != null || destination != null);
>>>>>>> d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb
    }

    public boolean isRunServer() {
        return runServer;
    }
```
