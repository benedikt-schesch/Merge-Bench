To resolve this merge conflict, we need to combine the changes from both versions. The original version ends with an assertion, while the new version adds a test method `testNumericGte()`. The changes are complementary and can coexist.

```java
            Tuple t = (Tuple)it.next();
            Double first = Double.valueOf(t.get(0).toString());
            Double second = Double.valueOf(t.get(1).toString());
            assertTrue(first.compareTo(second) < 0);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Tests numeric greater than or equal comparison
     */
    @Test
    public void testNumericGte() throws Throwable {
```
