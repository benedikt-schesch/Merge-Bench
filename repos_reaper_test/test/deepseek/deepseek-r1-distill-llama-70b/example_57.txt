The conflict is between two branches that check if `tempWhiteDeck` has enough cards. The HEAD branch uses an if statement with a return true at the end, while the other branch directly returns the result of the comparison. Both approaches have the same effect, but the latter is more concise.

```java
      if (tempBlackDeck.totalCount() < MINIMUM_BLACK_CARDS) {
        return false;
      }

      final WhiteDeck tempWhiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
      return tempWhiteDeck.totalCount() >= getRequiredWhiteCardCount();
    }
  }

  /**
   * Deal cards for this round. The game immediately then moves into the {@code PLAYING} state.
```
