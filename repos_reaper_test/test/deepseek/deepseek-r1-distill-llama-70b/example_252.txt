The code snippet shows a merge conflict in the import statements of a Java file. The imports from `java.net` are present in one version (HEAD) but are removed in the other version. Without additional context about which version should take precedence or whether these imports are required by the remaining code, it's ambiguous which set of imports is correct.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.io.SequenceInputStream;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.SocketException;
import java.net.SocketImplFactory;
import java.net.URL;
