To resolve this conflict, we need to determine which condition better captures the intent of checking whether a field should be skipped. The original code checks if the value is null, while the new code checks if the key exists.

Using `jsonObject.has(facebookFieldName)` is more appropriate because it explicitly checks if the field exists in the JSON object, whereas `get()` can return null even if the field is present with a null value.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
      // For each Facebook-annotated field on the current Java object, pull data
      // out of the JSON object and put it in the Java object
      for (FieldWithAnnotation<Facebook> fieldWithAnnotation : fieldsWithAnnotation) {
        String facebookFieldName = getFacebookFieldName(fieldWithAnnotation);

        if (!jsonObject.has(facebookFieldName)) {
          if (MAPPER_LOGGER.isTraceEnabled()) {
            MAPPER_LOGGER
              .trace(format("No JSON value present for '%s', skipping. JSON is '%s'.", facebookFieldName, json));
          }
```
