Here is the entire snippet with the conflict resolved, preserving the context and spacing from both sides. The conflict was between two identical comment blocks, so I've retained the content from both sides without modification:

```java
   * parameter is the declared field class. Declared fields of type {@link Collection} are used to
   * support repeating data key names, so each member of the collection is an additional data key
   * value. They are parsed the same as "primitive" fields, except that the generic type parameter
   * of the collection is used as the {@link Class} parameter.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
