Okay, so I'm looking at this merge conflict. It seems like on the HEAD branch, someone added an import for `TwitterDbAdapter`, while on the other branch, they added a few different imports: `StatusTable`, `Followable`, `HasFavorite`, and `Retrievable`.

Since the conflict is in the import statements, I need to determine if these imports can coexist or if one set should take precedence over the other. The code on HEAD seems to be importing a database adapter, while the other branch is importing some task-related interfaces and database table information.

Given that these are different imports and they don't directly conflict with each other, it seems possible to combine them. However, without more context about how these imports are used in the code, it's safer to present both sets of imports together.

```java
import android.database.Cursor;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.view.Menu;

import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.Tweet;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.data.db.TwitterDbAdapter;
