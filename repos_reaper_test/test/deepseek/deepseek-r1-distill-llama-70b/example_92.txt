Here's the merged code snippet with the conflict resolved:

```java
    this.userPermalinkFormatString = userPermalinkFormatString;
  }

  @Override
  public Map<ReturnableData, Object> handle(final RequestWrapper request,
                                            final HttpSession session) {
    final HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> ret = new HashMap<>();
    ret.put(AjaxResponse.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED, gameChatEnabled);
    ret.put(AjaxResponse.GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED, globalChatEnabled);

    if (banList.contains(request.getRemoteAddr())) {
      LOG.info(String.format("Rejecting user from %s because they are banned.",
              request.getRemoteAddr()));
```

The conflict was resolved by combining both changes:
1. Keeping the simpler `new HashMap<>()` syntax from HEAD
2. Adding the `GAME_CHAT_ENABLED` entry from ed08e371
3. Maintaining the existing `GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED` entry and ban check logic

This preserves all the functionality from both branches while maintaining consistent coding style.
