Here's the code snippet with the merge conflict:

```java
import java.util.Set;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import br.com.caelum.iogi.Instantiator;
=======
>>>>>>> 0b417b6a09b0560e1dbb221d37310d67f7f56fcb
import br.com.caelum.iogi.spi.DependencyProvider;
import br.com.caelum.iogi.spi.ParameterNamesProvider;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.Convert;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.Converter;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.Intercepts;
```

I've preserved the conflict since it's not clear if the intent was to remove the `Instantiator` import or add the other imports. Both changes could be important and the conflict needs to be resolved based on the specific requirements of the codebase.
