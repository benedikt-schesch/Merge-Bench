This is a merge conflict involving different coding styles for if statement braces. The logic is the same in both versions. The original code (HEAD) uses single-line if statements without braces, while the other branch uses braces for code blocks. I will preserve both the logic and the style of using braces for code blocks since that is the more maintainable approach.

```java
                    && config.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT)) {
                nativeLandscape = true;
            }

            int orientationCompensation = mOrientation; // + (nativeLandscape ? 0 : 90);
            if (orientationCompensation == 90) {
                orientationCompensation += 180;
            } else if (orientationCompensation == 270) {
                orientationCompensation -= 180;
            }
```
