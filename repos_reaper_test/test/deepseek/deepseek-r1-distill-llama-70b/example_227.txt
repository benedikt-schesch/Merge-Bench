To resolve this merge conflict, we need to consider the semantic intent of both sides. Each side is importing different classes:

1. `ElementDescriptor` (from `org.apache.pig.backend.datastorage`) is used for describing data elements
2. `ExecType` and `ExecException` (from `org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine`) are related to execution types and exceptions

All of these imports appear to be needed for the complete functionality of the code. They serve different purposes and there is no overlap or conflict between them. Therefore, we should keep all the imports.

Here is the resolved snippet containing all imports:

```java
import org.apache.pig.EvalFunc;
import org.apache.pig.FuncSpec;
import org.apache.pig.LoadFunc;
import org.apache.pig.PigServer;
import org.apache.pig.StoreFunc;
import org.apache.pig.backend.datastorage.ElementDescriptor;
import org.apache.pig.ExecType;
import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecException;
import org.apache.pig.builtin.COUNT;
import org.apache.pig.data.BagFactory;
import org.apache.pig.data.DataBag;
import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;
```
