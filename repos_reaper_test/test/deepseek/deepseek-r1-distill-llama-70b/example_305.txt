Here's the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict addressed:

```java
  }

  @Override protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();

    if (myDecoderView != null) {
      myDecoderView.startCamera();
    }
  }

  @Override protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
```

The resolution preserves the null safety check from the cb961dc3d5c704340d8ab747637d1c475bedc03d branch while maintaining the intent to start the camera when the activity resumes. This approach is more robust as it prevents potential NullPointerExceptions if myDecoderView is null.
