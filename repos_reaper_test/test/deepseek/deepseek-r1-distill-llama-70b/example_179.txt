In this case, we are dealing with a semantic merge conflict between two versions of code comments that describe the behavior of the `PlanBuilder` class. 

The original version (HEAD) provides a general comment about the `PlanBuilder` class producing a logical plan, while the other version adds more specific information about validation behavior. The intent of both comments appears to align - describing the functionality of `PlanBuilder`, but they differ in specificity.

Since the comments are complementary rather than conflicting, we can resolve this by merging both comments into a single, more comprehensive comment that retains both the general description and the specific validation detail. This approach preserves the intent of both versions while maintaining clarity for future readers.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
import java.util.Map;

import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.parser.ParseException;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.parser.QueryParser;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.OperatorKey;

/**
 * PlanBuilder class outputs a logical plan given a query String and set of ValidIDs
 * 
.semantics{
   Output: Plan
   This function doesn't validate whether all ValidIDs are used, 
   only that each operator uses at least one ValidID.
}
