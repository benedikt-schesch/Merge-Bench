The conflict appears to be about whether to close the connection (`con.close()`) after reading the response. One side of the merge is trying to close the connection while the other side removes it. The context suggests that both sides are working with network connections and proper cleanup is important. The intent seems to be to ensure the connection is properly closed after use to avoid resource leaks.

Here is the resolved version that maintains the connection closure while preserving the error handling:

```java
			jp.setCodec(mapper);
			final JsonNode ret = jp.readValueAs(JsonNode.class);
			Log.v("Connection", "Command " + command + ": " + data.toString());
		_Log.v("Connection", ret.toString());
			con.close();
			return ret;
		} catch (MalformedURLException e) {
			if(manager != null) {
				manager.onError(e);
			}
		} catch (IOException e) {
```
