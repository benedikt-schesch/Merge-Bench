I'll resolve the conflict by taking the more precise terminology and improved formatting from the commit while preserving the core warning message. Here's the merged code:

```java
			logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
					+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
					+ "\tFor the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for grants or node ownership during data deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of this ambiguity, node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported!\n\n"
					+ "\t" + ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
					+ "\n\n\tConsider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.\n"
					+ "###############################################################################"
			);
			publishWarningMessage(title, text);
		}
```
