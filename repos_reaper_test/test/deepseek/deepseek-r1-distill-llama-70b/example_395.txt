To resolve this merge conflict, we need to carefully consider the intent behind each change and the implications of each modification. 

1. **Access Modifier**: The HEAD branch removes the `public` access modifier, which is typical for test methods in JUnit as they don't usually need to be public. The other branch adds the `public` modifier, but this is unnecessary unless specifically required.
   
2. **Method Name Typo**: The HEAD branch has a typo in `prepateCore`, which should be `prepareCore` as in the other branch.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
		when(coreRegistry.getCore(projectAUri)).thenReturn(core);
		return core;
	}

	@Test
	void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun() throws CoreException {
		InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 0);

		workspace.updateProjects(Collections.singleton(resource));

		assertStatusIs(noTestsRun());
		verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));
```
