Here's the semantically merged code:
```java
   * Constructor to delete a specific family.
   * <strong>These byte arrays will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @param table The table to edit.
   * @param key The key of the row to edit in that table.
   * @param family The column family to edit in that table.
   * @since 1.1
   */
  public DeleteRequest(final byte[] table,
                       final byte[] key,
                       final byte[] family) {
```

The merge combines the Javadoc comments by retaining the original documentation and adding the `@since` tag from the other branch, indicating the API was added in version 1.1. The constructor signature is identical in both branches so it remains unchanged.
