The conflict is in the type parameter of the `EvalFunc` generic class. The `HEAD` branch uses `DataAtom` while the other branch uses `Integer`. Based on the context and semantic intent, both represent different return types for the function, but we cannot determine which is more appropriate without additional context. The conflict is preserved as is:

```java
/**
 * built-in grouping function; permits system to choose any grouping.
 */
<<<<<<< HEAD
public class GFAny extends EvalFunc<DataAtom> {
=======
public class GFAny extends EvalFunc<Integer> {
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    public static final int defaultNumGroups = 1000;
    
    int numGroups = defaultNumGroups;
    Random r = new Random();
    

```
