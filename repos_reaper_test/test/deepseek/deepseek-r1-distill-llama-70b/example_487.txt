Here is the resolved code, taking into account the intent of using a texture atlas for the font, which is more efficient for handling font textures:

```java
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d

	private TextureRegion mRadarPointTextureRegion;
	private TextureRegion mRadarTextureRegion;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mFontTexture;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private Font mFont;

	private Location mUserLocation;

	private final ArrayList<City> mCities = new ArrayList<City>();
```
