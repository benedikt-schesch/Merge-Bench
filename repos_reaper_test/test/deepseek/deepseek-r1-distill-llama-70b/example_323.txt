To resolve the merge conflict, I analyzed both versions and selected the one that appears to be the intended update, as it includes a simplified tweet text and a possibly corrected drawable resource.

```java
		}

		PendingIntent intent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0,
				MentionActivity.createIntent(this), 0);

		notify(intent, MENTION_NOTIFICATION_ID, R.drawable.notify_mention,
				Utils.getSimpleTweetText(latestTweet.text), title, text);
	}

	private static int TWEET_NOTIFICATION_ID = 0;
	private static int DM_NOTIFICATION_ID = 1;
	private static int MENTION_NOTIFICATION_ID = 2;
```
