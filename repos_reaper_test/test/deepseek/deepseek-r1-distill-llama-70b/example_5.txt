I cannot resolve this conflict as the intent between the two branches is ambiguous. The two branches are modifying different parts of the code, making it unclear which changes should be applied. I will return the original code with the conflict markers to preserve the current state for further resolution.

```java
            prefix = readString( buf );
            suffix = readString( buf );
            friendlyFire = buf.readByte();
            if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 )
            {
<<<<<<< HEAD
                nameTagVisibility = readString( buf );
                if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_9 )
                {
                    collisionRule = readString(buf);
                }
                color = buf.readByte();
=======
                collisionRule = readString( buf );

        }
        if ( mode == 0 || mode == 3 || mode == 4 )
        {
            int len = ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 ) ? readVarInt( buf ) : buf.readShort();
