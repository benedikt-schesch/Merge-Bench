I cannot resolve this conflict as the intent is ambiguous. Both sides appear to be attempting to define constants for alarm operations, but there are differences in both the naming conventions and the hex values assigned. The conflict appears to be semantic as the constants' meanings might be overlapping or conflicting.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
    private static final int MAX_SUPPORTED_VERSION = 3;

    private static final int ALARM_GET = 0x04;
    private static final int ALARM_REPORT = 0x05;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private static final int ALARM_SUPPORTED_GET = 0x06;
    private static final int ALARM_SUPPORTED_REPORT = 0x07;
=======
    private static final int ALARM_GET_SUPPORTED = 0x07;
    private static final int ALARM_SUPPORTED_REPORT = 0x08;
>>>>>>> dff01786de3c5fdc4121d54712819008777841ff

    private final Map<AlarmType, Alarm> alarms = new HashMap<AlarmType, Alarm>();

    @XStreamOmitField
    private boolean initialiseDone = false;
```
