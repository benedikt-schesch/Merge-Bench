To resolve this merge conflict, we need to determine which class to use for `mFontTexture`. Both sides are attempting to create a texture for font rendering, but they differ in the approach:

1. **BitmapTexture (HEAD)**: Used for single textures, which is appropriate for a font texture since it doesn't require atlas packing.
2. **BitmapTextureAtlas (other branch)**: Used for texture atlases, which is typically for managing multiple textures in a single image.

Since font rendering typically uses a single texture, `BitmapTexture` is the more appropriate choice here. Therefore, we will keep the HEAD version.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
		return new Engine(new EngineOptions(true, ScreenOrientation.LANDSCAPE, new RatioResolutionPolicy(CAMERA_WIDTH, CAMERA_HEIGHT), this.mCamera));
	}

	@Override
	public void onLoadResources() {
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTexture(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
		this.mFont = new Font(this.mFontTexture, Typeface.create(Typeface.DEFAULT, Typeface.BOLD), 32, true, Color.BLACK);

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mFontTexture);
		this.mEngine.getFontManager().loadFont(this.mFont);
```
