I'll help resolve this merge conflict by considering the intent of both changes. The conflict is over the naming of a `TextView` in the `ViewHolder` class.

* `followBtn` suggests this is a button for following a user (common in social media applications)
* `testBtn` suggests this is a test button (likely temporary or for debugging)

Given the context appears to be a user-centric application where users can have followers, `followBtn` is more likely the correct semantic choice.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
	private static class ViewHolder {
		public ImageView profileImage;
		public TextView screenName;
		public TextView userId;
		public TextView lastStatus;
		public TextView followBtn;
	}

	@Override
	public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
		View view;
```
