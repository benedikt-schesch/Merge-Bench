To resolve the merge conflict, we need to identify the changes made in both branches and decide which changes to keep. In this case:

- The `HEAD` branch added a new field `private SharedPreferences mSharedPreferences;`
- The other branch (commit `308db82`) does not have this field

Since the field `mSharedPreferences` appears to be a new addition in the `HEAD` branch, and there is no conflicting change in the other branch, we can incorporate the change from `HEAD` while preserving the surrounding context.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
    private Timer mBackgroundTimer;
    private String mBackgroundImageUrl;
    private ArrayObjectAdapter mAdapter;
    private CardPresenter mCardPresenter;
    private TvShowsCardPresenter mTvShowsCardPresenter;
    private SharedPreferences mSharedPreferences;

    private BroadcastReceiver videoUpdateReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
        @Override
        public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
            Bundle bundle = intent.getExtras();
```
