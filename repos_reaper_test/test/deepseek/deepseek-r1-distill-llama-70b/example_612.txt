To resolve this merge conflict, we need to combine both changes. The `serialVersionUID` from the HEAD branch and the new `rawStartTime` field from the other branch should both be included in the final code:

```java
 * @author Venil Noronha
 * @since 1.6.16
 */
public class PageRating extends FacebookType {

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  @Facebook("start_time")
  private String rawStartTime;

  /**
   * Time the rating took place
```
