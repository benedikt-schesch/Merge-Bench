The code snippet includes a merge conflict between two different declarations of `mMenuTexture`. The conflict shows that one side declares it as a `BitmapTexture` and the other as a `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Since both classes are part of the same library and serve related but different purposes (BitmapTexture for single textures, BitmapTextureAtlas for texture atlases), this could represent an intentional change in functionality. However, without more context, it's ambiguous which one is correct.

To preserve the conflict and ensure no accidental semantic changes:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mMenuTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mMenuTexture;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
