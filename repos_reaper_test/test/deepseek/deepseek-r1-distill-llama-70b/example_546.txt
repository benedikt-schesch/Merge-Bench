The snippet you've provided shows a merge conflict in Java code where both sides of the merge are performing the same check for supported languages, but with slightly different formatting. The intent on both sides appears to be the same - validating that the provided language is supported.

Since the functionality is identical but only the formatting differs, I will preserve the conflict as it appears to be purely a stylistic difference rather than a functional one. Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java

        if (StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(defSource) && jaxRsResources.isEmpty()) {
            failWithErrorMessage("You should specify the definition source to use (value no prefixed by any option). ");
        }

<<<<<<< HEAD
        if (!StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(language)
                && !SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.contains(language)) {
            failWithErrorMessage("The language " + language
                    + " is not currently supported. ");
=======
        if (!StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(language) && !SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.contains(language)) {
            failWithErrorMessage("The language " + language + " is not currently supported. ");

        }

        if (StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(serviceUrl)) {
            serviceUrl = "https://apispark.restlet.com/";
        }
