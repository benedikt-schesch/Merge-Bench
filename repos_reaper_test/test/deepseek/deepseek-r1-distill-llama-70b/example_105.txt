To resolve this merge conflict, we need to ensure that all necessary imports are included while avoiding unnecessary ones. The original code used a wildcard import for JUnit's Assert class, which brings in all static assert methods. The merged change replaces this with specific imports for assertEquals and assertSame, which may become problematic if other assert methods are used elsewhere in the code. Since the full context isn't provided, we can't determine if all methods are needed, so it's safest to present the conflict.
