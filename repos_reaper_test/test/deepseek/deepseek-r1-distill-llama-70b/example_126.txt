The snippet shows a merge conflict between two branches where the code is trying to display a commit message. The original code (HEAD) uses `commit.commit.message`, while the other branch uses `commit.message`.

Here is the conflict:

```java
  @Override
  public void onResponse(Commit commit, boolean firstTime) {

    if (commit.commit != null && commit.commit.message != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.commit.message));
=======
      commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.message));
>>>>>>> c120f1dfe1a968fce9fb82f405228d0fe13fe71c
    }

    User author = commit.author;

    if (author != null) {
```

Without additional context about the `Commit` object structure, both versions could be valid depending on the object's properties. Since the if-condition explicitly checks for `commit.commit.message`, I will preserve the original version that uses `commit.commit.message` to maintain consistency with the null-check.

```java
  @Override
  public void onResponse(Commit commit, boolean firstTime) {

    if (commit.commit != null && commit.commit.message != null) {
      commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.commit.message));
    }

    User author = commit.author;

    if (author != null) {
```
