To resolve this merge conflict, we need to consider the imports from both sides and determine if they can coexist or if one side should take precedence. Here, both sets of imports appear to be adding different types that may be needed by the code.

The left side (HEAD) is importing:
```java
import org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes;
import org.jbake.util.DataFileUtil;
```

The right side (1b5691ad2a7d734321d0382e71743a85835556b3) is importing:
```java
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.jbake.model.ModelAttributes;
```

Since these are different classes being imported, we can include both sets of imports. The resolved snippet would be:

```java
package org.jbake.app;

import org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;
import org.hamcrest.BaseMatcher;
import org.hamcrest.Description;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes;
import org.jbake.util.DataFileUtil;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.jbake.model.ModelAttributes;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.BeforeClass;
import org.junit.Test;
```
