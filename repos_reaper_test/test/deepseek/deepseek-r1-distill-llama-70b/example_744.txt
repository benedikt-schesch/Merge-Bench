The merge conflict is purely a matter of code style (braces formatting) and does not affect functionality. Both versions do the same thing. The version with braces is preferable as it follows more common Java coding conventions where control flow statements use braces even for single-line blocks.

```java
        mTotalHeight = WIDGETS_MARGIN;

        for (int i = 0; i < mOpenWidgets.size(); i++) {
            WidgetBase.WidgetContainer widget = mOpenWidgets.get(i);

            if (widget != ignore) {
                widget.setYSmooth(mTotalHeight);
            }

            mTotalHeight += widget.getMeasuredHeight() + mSpacing;
        }
    }
```
