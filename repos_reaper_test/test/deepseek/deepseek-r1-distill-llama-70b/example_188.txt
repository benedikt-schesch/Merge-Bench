I cannot resolve this merge conflict as the changes between the two branches are not provided. I will return the snippet with the conflict markers preserved.

```java
    public int read(byte b[], int off, int len) throws IOException {
        int read = in.read(b, off, len);
        pos += read;
        return read;
    }

        pos += rc;
        return rc;
