This appears to be a merge conflict where one side added a serialVersionUID and the other side added a Javadoc comment for a method. The changes are independent and don't conflict with each other. Here's the resolved version that combines both changes:

```java
   * Represents the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/video-format/">Video Format Graph
   * API type</a>.
   */
  public static class VideoFormat extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * HTML to embed the video in this format.
     * 
     * @return HTML to embed the video in this format.
     */
```

I've combined both changes since:
1. The serialVersionUID is a standard field that helps with serialization in Java
2. The Javadoc comment is needed for documenting the method
3. These are independent additions that don't conflict with each other
