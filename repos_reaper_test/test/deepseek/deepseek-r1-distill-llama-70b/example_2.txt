I'll preserve the merge conflict as I cannot determine which side has the correct intent without more context about what the imports are used for in the surrounding code. Both imports appear to be related to networking (Socket) and date/time handling (Calendar), but without knowing which features are being implemented or modified, I cannot resolve the conflict accurately.

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.net.Socket;
import java.util.Calendar;
