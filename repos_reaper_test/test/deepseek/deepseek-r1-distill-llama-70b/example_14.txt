To resolve this merge conflict, we need to carefully examine the imports being added from both sides and determine which ones are necessary.

The left side adds:
```java
import org.spout.api.protocol.CommonHandler;
```

The right side adds:
```java
import org.spout.api.protocol.CommonPipelineFactory;
import org.spout.api.protocol.PortBinding;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Protocol;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Session;
import org.spout.api.render.RenderMode;
```

Looking at these imports, they appear to be adding related classes from the protocol package, which suggests the code is working with some network or rendering protocol implementation.

Since there's no overlap between the imports being added from both sides, we can safely include all of them. The `CommonHandler` from the left and the protocol-related classes from the right appear to serve different purposes but are likely both needed by the codebase.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Point;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Transform;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector2;
import org.spout.api.protocol.CommonHandler;
import org.spout.api.protocol.CommonPipelineFactory;
import org.spout.api.protocol.PortBinding;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Protocol;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Session;
import org.spout.api.render.RenderMode;
```
