I cannot resolve this merge conflict as it's ambiguous which set of variables and formatting was intended. I'll return the snippet with the conflict markers:

```java
      } else {
        started = false;
      }
      if (started) {
        currentUniqueId = uniqueIdProvider.get();
<<<<<<< HEAD
        logger.info(String.format("Starting game %d with card sets %s, Cardcast %s, %d blanks, %d "
                + "max players, %d max spectators, %d score limit, players %s, unique %s.",
            id, options.cardSetIds, customDecksIds, options.blanksInDeck, options.playerLimit,
            options.spectatorLimit, options.scoreGoal, players, currentUniqueId));

        // do this stuff outside the players lock; they will lock players again later for much less
        // time, and not at the same time as trying to lock users, which has caused deadlocks
        final List<CardSet> cardSets;
        synchronized (options.cardSetIds) {
          cardSets = loadCardSets(session);
