I cannot resolve this merge conflict because the intent is ambiguous. The HEAD version passes `server_version` to `MultiAction` while the other version uses a no-arg constructor. Without more context, it's unclear which version is correct. Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
    MultiAction batch;
    boolean schedule_flush = false;

    synchronized (this) {
      if (batched_rpcs == null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        batched_rpcs = new MultiAction(server_version);
=======
        batched_rpcs = new MultiAction();
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
        addMultiActionCallbacks(batched_rpcs);
        schedule_flush = true;
      }
      batch = batched_rpcs;
      // Unfortunately we have to hold the monitor on `this' while we do
```
