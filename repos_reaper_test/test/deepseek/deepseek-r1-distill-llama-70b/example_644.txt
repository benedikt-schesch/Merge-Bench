The merge conflict is between two different assertion statements that achieve the same goal of verifying the content type is "image/png". The choice between them depends on the preferred assertion style:

- `assertThat` with `hasContentType()` is using Hamcrest matchers and is more descriptive
- `assertEquals` is the standard JUnit assertion

Here is the resolved code:

```java
  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_imagePng() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.png", attachmentData.getBytes());
    assertThat(att).hasContentType("image/png");
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_html() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
```
