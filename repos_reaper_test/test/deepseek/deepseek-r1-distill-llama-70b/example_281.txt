I cannot resolve this conflict with confidence. The conflicting lines appear to be accessing an index from different objects (`myKey` vs `keyWritable`). Without more context about what these objects represent and their relationship, it's ambiguous which one should be used. I will return the original snippet with the conflict.

```java
    public Result getNext() throws ExecException {
        if (bags == null) {
            return new Result(POStatus.STATUS_EOP, null);
        }

<<<<<<< HEAD
        byte origIndex = myKey.getIndex();
=======
        byte origIndex = keyWritable.getIndex();
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a

        int index = (int)origIndex;
        index &= idxPart;

        if (index >= packagers.size() || index < 0) {
```
