This is a merge conflict between two different import statements for `Vector3`:
- `org.spout.math.vector.Vector3` (HEAD)
- `org.spout.api.math.Vector3` (cc0703054530b4eeda07a2b1b619ed34e1e7d201)

The semantic intent appears to be importing the `Vector3` class from the appropriate package. Since `ReactConverter` is already being imported from `org.spout.api.math`, it is more consistent to use the `Vector3` from the same `org.spout.api.math` package.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
 * the MIT license.
 */
package org.spout.api.collision;

import org.spout.api.math.ReactConverter;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
import org.spout.physics.collision.ContactInfo;

public class SpoutContactInfo {
	private final ContactInfo wrapped;
