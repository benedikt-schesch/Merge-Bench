To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind each change. The conflict is about the formatting of a comment line. The original version in HEAD has a space after the comment delimiter, which is a common practice in Java. The other version removes the space, possibly for style reasons but against conventional Java standards. Therefore, we keep the original comment with the space.

```java
    public Result getNext() throws ExecException {
        if (bags == null) {
            return new Result(POStatus.STATUS_EOP, null);
        }

        // Create numInputs bags
        Object[] fields = new Object[mBags.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < mBags.length; i++) {
            if (mBags[i]) fields[i] = createDataBag(numBags);
        }
```
