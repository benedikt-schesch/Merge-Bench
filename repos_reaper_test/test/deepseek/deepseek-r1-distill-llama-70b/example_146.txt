To resolve this merge conflict, we need to determine the appropriate access level for the `empty` static variable. The `protected` access modifier allows subclasses to access the variable, while `private` restricts access to the declaring class only. Since the original code was `protected static Result empty;` and without clear indication that tighter access is necessary, we will retain the `protected` access level to maintain compatibility with potential subclasses.

```java

public class POStore extends PhysicalOperator {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
