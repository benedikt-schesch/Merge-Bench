The conflicting code shows two different ways of creating a GruntParser. The key difference is that one version includes an additional `myPig` parameter. This parameter likely represents a PigContext that provides important context for the parser.

The resolution prioritizes including the `myPig` parameter, assuming it adds necessary context for parsing the script correctly. Here's the resolved code:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "dump b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
