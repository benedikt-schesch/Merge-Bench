I see that there is a merge conflict between two different ways of getting a logger:

1. Using `LogManager.getLogger()` from Log4j 2
2. Using `Logger.getLogger()` which could be from SLF4J or another logging framework

Without knowing the specific logging framework used in the project, it's ambiguous which one should be chosen. I'll return the snippet with the conflict:

```java
   * be able to start.
   * <p>
   * We need 20 * maxPlayers cards. This allows black cards up to "draw 9" to work correctly.
   */
  public final static int MINIMUM_WHITE_CARDS_PER_PLAYER = 20;
