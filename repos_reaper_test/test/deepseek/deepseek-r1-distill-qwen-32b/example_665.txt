To resolve this merge conflict, we need to consider the intent of both changes. The original code (HEAD) includes three injected dependencies, while the merged code (4b0f0ad) adds an additional injection of `IMavenProjectRegistry`. Since both sets of dependencies seem necessary, we'll include all of them.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    @Inject private List<ClasspathConfigurer> classpathConfigurers;

    @Inject private AndroidProjectFactory<MavenAndroidProject, MavenProject> mavenProjectFactory;

    @Inject private AndroidProjectFactory<EclipseAndroidProject, IProject> eclipseProjectFactory;
    @Inject private IMavenProjectRegistry registry;

    public void configure(ProjectConfigurationRequest request, IProgressMonitor monitor) throws CoreException {
        markerManager.deleteMarkers(request.getPom(), AndroidMavenPlugin.APKLIB_ERROR_TYPE);

        try {

```
