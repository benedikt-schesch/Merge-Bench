To resolve the conflict, we'll adopt the change from the merged commit since it suggests a more efficient approach using an atlas for multiple textures, which is a common practice in graphics-intensive applications for performance and organization.

The resolved code snippet is:

```java

	protected Camera mCamera;

	protected Scene mMainScene;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	protected MenuScene mMenuScene;
