The snippet has a merge conflict involving multiple variables:

```java
public static final String TAG = "TwitterApplication";

public static ImageManager mImageManager;
public static TwitterDbAdapter mDb; 
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public static Weibo mApi; // new API
  public static Context mContext;
=======
  public static TwitterApi mApi;
  public static Weibo nApi; // new API
  public static DatabaseHelper mDb2; 
>>>>>>> de460f053e7948460b81e71a410d665d956db90a

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
```

The conflict involves:
1. Different API implementations (`Weibo` vs `TwitterApi`)
2. Naming differences for API variables (`mApi` vs `nApi`)
3. Database handling differences (`TwitterDbAdapter` vs `DatabaseHelper`)
4. Presence of `Context` in one version but not the other

Without knowing the specific intent of these changes, it's not possible to resolve this conflict automatically. The changes could represent parallel but conflicting approaches to refactoring the API and database handling. 

Maintaining semantic consistency would require either:

1. Choosing one API implementation and naming convention
2. Merging both APIs in a way that maintains compatibility
3. Resolving the database adapter differences
4. Deciding whether context management belongs here

Since these are potentially breaking changes, I recommend returning the conflict as-is for manual resolution by the developers involved.
