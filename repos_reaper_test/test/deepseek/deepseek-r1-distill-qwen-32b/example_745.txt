The change only affects the capitalization of the comment and the actual code after the comment is identical on both sides. Since this doesn't impact functionality but represents a style change, we'll preserve both intents by selecting the right side of the conflict.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
        mOpenWidgets.add(widget);

        // Make sure the widget is properly oriented
        widget.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientation, true);

        // Position it properly
        widget.forceFinalY(mTotalHeight - WIDGETS_MARGIN);
        widget.setY(mTotalHeight - WIDGETS_MARGIN);
        mTotalHeight += widget.getMeasuredHeight() + mSpacing;
    }
```

I resolved this by choosing the right side of the conflict since it appears to be a stylistic change rather than a functional change. The comment was simply capitalized differently but the code that follows is identical in both versions.
