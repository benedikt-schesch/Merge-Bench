The merge conflict involves a difference in the logging message where `customDecksIds` is used in one version and `cardcastDeckIds` in the other. The rest of the changes around it don't indicate which one is correct.

Without more context about whether `customDecksIds` or `cardcastDeckIds` is the intended variable to log, it's safest not to resolve the conflict automatically.

```java
      } else {
        started = false;
      }
      if (started) {
        currentUniqueId = uniqueIdProvider.get();

                + "max players, %d max spectators, %d score limit, players %s, unique %s.",
            id, options.cardSetIds, customDecksIds, options.blanksInDeck, options.playerLimit,
            options.spectatorLimit, options.scoreGoal, players, currentUniqueId));
