Since both sides of the merge conflict achieve the same semantic intent with different formatting, the conflict can be resolved by choosing one format. Given that both approaches check for null and call seekTo, the braces version is more standard for better readability.

```java
>>>>>>> ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66
    }

    @Override
    public void seekTo(long msec) {
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            sMediaPlayer.seekTo((int) msec);
        }
>>>>>>> ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66
    }

    @Override
    public void tryPrepareNext(final Query query) {
        TomahawkRunnable r = new TomahawkRunnable(1) {
