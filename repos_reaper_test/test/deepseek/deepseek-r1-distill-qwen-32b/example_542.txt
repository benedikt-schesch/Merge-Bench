To resolve this conflict, we'll keep the two callback variables as they appear on the left side since both scan and advertise callbacks are necessary for the intended functionality.

```java
        scanCallbackContext.sendPluginResult(pluginResult);
      }
    }
  };

<<<<<<< HEAD
  //API 21+ Scan and Advertise Callbacks
  private ScanCallback scanCallback = null;
  private AdvertiseCallback advertiseCallback = null;
=======
  //Scan Callback
  private ScanCallback scanCallback = null;
>>>>>>> e9e8024f1f82edc97fc8bdec6af75e81ea5b0bfa

  //TODO Is there a cleaner way to prevent this from running on KitKat
  protected void pluginInitialize() {
    if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
      return;
```

The resolution keeps both `scanCallback` and `advertiseCallback` to support the required functionality for API 21+.
