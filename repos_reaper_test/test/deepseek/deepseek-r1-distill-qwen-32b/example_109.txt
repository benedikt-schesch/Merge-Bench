I'll help resolve the merge conflict. Let me analyze the context and intent.

On line 5-6 (HEAD), we have explicit imports for Employee and Name classes:
```java
import org.fest.test.Employee;
import org.fest.test.Name;
```

On line 6-7 (other commit), there's a wildcard import:
```java
import org.fest.test.*;
```

The explicit imports are more precise, while the wildcard import is broader. The wildcard import may include additional test classes beyond what's needed.

Given the existing imports and the known usage in the class, the recommended resolution is to keep the explicit imports since they provide better clarity about which specific classes are being used.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

import java.util.*;

import org.fest.assertions.internal.PropertySupport;
import org.fest.test.Employee;
import org.fest.test.Name;
import org.junit.*;

/**
 * Tests for <code>{@link Properties#from(Object[])}</code>.
 * 

```
