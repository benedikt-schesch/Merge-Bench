To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine which variable declaration is correct based on the intended functionality. If `BitmapTextureAtlas` is the intended type, we should use that; otherwise, keep `BitmapTexture`.

```java
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private int mFaceIDCounter;
	private final SparseArray<Sprite> mFaces = new SparseArray<Sprite>();


```

Since both versions cannot coexist without causing duplication, we'll choose the `BitmapTextureAtlas` version as it's more specific.

```java
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private int mFaceIDCounter;
	private final SparseArray<Sprite> mFaces = new SparseArray<Sprite>();


```
