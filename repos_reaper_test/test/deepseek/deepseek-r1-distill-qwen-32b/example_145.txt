The conflict appears to be related to import statements where both sides are trying to import different classes from the same package (`org.apache.hadoop`). However, without seeing the full context of how these imports are being used in the rest of the file, I cannot confidently determine which imports are actually needed.

The imports from both sides seem to be valid and could potentially coexist since they're importing different classes. The HEAD side is importing `DistributedCache` and `FileStatus`, while the other side is importing `FileSystem`, `Path`, `IOUtils`, `BZip2Codec`, and `GzipCodec`.

Given the ambiguity in usage without the full file context, I'll return the snippet with the conflict unresolved.

```java
import java.util.Properties;

import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;
import org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.apache.hadoop.filecache.DistributedCache;
import org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileStatus;

import org.apache.hadoop.io.IOUtils;
