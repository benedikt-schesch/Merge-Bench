# Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Conflict Identification**: The merge conflict occurs when merging two versions of the same code, shown between the `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> 2125666c` lines.

2. **Constructors Analysis**:
   - **Head Version**: `GruntParser` is instantiated with a single argument: a `StringReader` created from the `script` variable.
   - **Commit Version**: Same `GruntParser` constructor but with an additional argument `myPig`.

3. **Potential Context**:
   - `StringReader(script)` is clear: it's providing the Pig script for parsing.
   - `myPig` might represent a Pig instance or configuration, possibly adding context or setup needed for parsing.

4. **Resolution Consideration**:
   - If `myPig` is essential for the parser's functionality (e.g., configuration), the commit version is correct.
   - If `myPig` is unnecessary or incorrectly added, the head version might be preferred.

5. **Ambiguity**:
   - Without knowing what `myPig` signifies or its role in `GruntParser`, it's impossible to definitively choose one version over the other.

6. **Conclusion**: Due to the ambiguity in semantic intent, the conflict cannot be confidently resolved without additional context.

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "explain b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";
