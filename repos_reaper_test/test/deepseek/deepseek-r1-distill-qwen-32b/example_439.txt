The code snippet shows a merge conflict in a Java file where one side (HEAD) has the method `setCreated()` and the other side (commit 308db82) has added the `isWatched()` and `setWatched()` methods. Since both changes seem to be adding new functionality without overlapping, the conflict can be resolved by accepting both sets of changes.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    }

    public void setCreated(long created) {
        this.created = created;
    }

    public boolean isWatched() {
        return isWatched;
    }

    public void setWatched(boolean isWatched) {
        this.isWatched = isWatched;
    }
}
```
