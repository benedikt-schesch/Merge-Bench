The correct code resolves the conflict by including both the `serialVersionUID` and the `name` field with its annotations. Here's the resolved code:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class Thumbnail extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * The name of the thumbnail
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
    private String name;

    // ... rest of the class
}
```

This way, the class maintains its serialization capability and adds the necessary field with proper getters and setters.
