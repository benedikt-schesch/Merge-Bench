To resolve this conflict, we'll integrate the additional documentation from the second version into the existing comment:

```java

  /**
   * Specifies a particular column qualifier to scan.
   * <p>
   * Note that specifying a qualifier without a family has no effect.
   * You need to call {@link #setFamily(byte[])} too.
   * @param qualifier The column qualifier.
   * <strong>This byte array will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @throws IllegalStateException if scanning already started.
   */
  public void setQualifier(final byte[] qualifier) {

```

The resolution combines both versions by including all the documentation provided by the second version while maintaining the overall intent and functionality of the method.
