The merge conflict involves two versions of instantiating `GruntParser`. The main difference is that one includes the `myPig` parameter and the other does not. If the additional context provided by `myPig` is necessary for the script to execute correctly, the second version is better. Otherwise, the original version suffices. Without more context, we'll adopt the version with the additional parameter for better functionality.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "dump b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```
