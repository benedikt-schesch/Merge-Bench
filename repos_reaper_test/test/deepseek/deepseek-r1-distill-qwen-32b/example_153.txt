To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the context and intent of each side of the merge:

<<<<<<< HEAD
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));
=======
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
>>>>>>> 2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea

The difference is that one version is using a 2-argument constructor for GruntParser that includes a Pig instance (`myPig`), while the other is using a 1-argument constructor.

Given that Pig needs to maintain state and context between operations, it makes sense that we would want to associate the parser with the existing Pig instance. Therefore, the more correct version is the one that includes `myPig` as a parameter.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "explain b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```
