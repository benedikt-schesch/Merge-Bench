The merge conflict involves the addition of the `@Beta` annotation in one branch compared to the original code. Here's the resolved code:

```java
  public boolean supportsMethod(String method) {
    return Arrays.binarySearch(SUPPORTED_METHODS, method) >= 0;
  }

  @Override
  @Beta
  public boolean isMtls() {
    return this.isMtls;
  }

  @Override
```

The `@Beta` annotation was added to indicate that the method is still in beta.
