```java

    public static final String PREFS_USER_KEY = "user";
    public static final String PREFS_PASSWORD_KEY = "password";

    public static final String VIDEO_UPDATE_ACTION = "videoUpdateAction";
    public static final String LIBRARY_UPDATED_ACTION = "libraryUpdatedAction";
    public static final String PALETTE_VISIBILITY = "paletteVisibility";
    public static final String PALETTE_VIBRANCY = "paletteVibrancy";
}
```

I resolved the conflict by combining both additions since they are independent constants that should coexist. The new constants from both sides of the merge (LIBRARY_UPDATED_ACTION, PALETTE_VISIBILITY, and PALETTE_VIBRANCY) are all needed in the code and don't conflict with each other semantically. They all appear to be action constants with unique names, so merging them together is safe.
