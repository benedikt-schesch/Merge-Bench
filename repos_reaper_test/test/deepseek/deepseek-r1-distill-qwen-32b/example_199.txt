I'll preserve the merge conflict as is since the intent to merge appears to be simply combining the added fields from both sides, and I'll present the combined result.

```java
    // handle to the back-end
    transient private ExecutionEngine executionEngine;
   
    private String jobName = JOB_NAME_PREFIX;    // can be overwritten by users
  
<<<<<<< HEAD
    // Pig Script Output
    private String jobOutputFile = "";
    
    // JobConf of the currently executing Map-Reduce job
    JobConf jobConf;
