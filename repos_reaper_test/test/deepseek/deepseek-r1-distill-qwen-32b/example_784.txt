To resolve the conflict, I'll choose the 256MB limit for safety.

The resolved code uses 256MB as the maximum buffer size to prevent excessive memory allocation from RPC corruption.

```java
   * undetected corruption of an RPC on the network, which would turn a
   * an innocuous RPC into something allocating a ton of memory.
   * The Hadoop RPC protocol doesn't do any checksumming as they probably
   * assumed that TCP checksums would be sufficient (they're not).
   */
  static final long MAX_BYTE_ARRAY_MASK =
    0xFFFFFFFFF0000000L;  // => max = 256MB

  /**
   * Verifies that the given length looks like a reasonable array length.
   * This method accepts 0 as a valid length.
   * @param buf The buffer from which the length was read.
```
