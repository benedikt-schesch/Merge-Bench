To resolve this merge conflict, we need to choose the version that best aligns with the intended functionality and code style.

The correct approach is to use the `KeyValue` object for better encapsulation and efficiency, as it correctly accumulates the size and serializes the object in a clean manner.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
        // Total number of bytes taken by those "KeyValues".
        buf.writeInt(0);  // We'll monkey patch this later.
      }
      nkeys_per_family++;

      final KeyValue kv = edit.kv();
      nbytes_per_family += kv.predictSerializedSize();
      kv.serialize(buf, KeyValue.PUT);
      prev = edit;
    }  // Yay, we made it!

    // Monkey-patch everything for the last set of edits.
    buf.setInt(nkeys_per_family_index, nkeys_per_family);
```
