The code snippet provided contains a merge conflict involving a `assertTrue` and `assertEquals` validation of the PigStatistics after running PigRunner in a test. The conflict appears to be between having the assert statements versus not having them.

Upon reflection:

- The assert statements validate that the Pig execution was successful and the return code was 0
- This represents important verification that the Pig job ran correctly
- The file deletion in the finally block suggests this is part of a test case cleanup

Given the purpose of this code appears to be testing/verification of the Pig execution, it would make sense to preserve the assert statements in order to maintain the test validation.

Therefore, the semantic resolution would keep the assert statements from HEAD as they provide important validation that should not be removed.

```java
        fw1.close();

        try {
           String[] args = { "-x", "local", "-c", PIG_FILE };
           PigStats stats = PigRunner.run(args, null);
           assertTrue(stats.isSuccessful());
           assertEquals( 0, stats.getReturnCode() );
        } finally {
            new File(PIG_FILE).delete();
            Util.deleteFile(cluster, OUTPUT_FILE);
        }
```
