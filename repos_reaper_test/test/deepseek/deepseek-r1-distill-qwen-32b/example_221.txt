The conflict appears to be between two versions of the same code block with slightly different spacing. Upon inspection, both versions are functionally identical but differ in whitespace. Given this, there's no semantic difference between the two versions, and either can be chosen arbitrarily.

Since this is a formatting-only difference without any functional impact, I'll resolve the conflict by choosing the first version.

Result:
```java
        if (lo instanceof LOCogroup) {
            assertTrue(((LOCogroup) lo).getRequestedParallelism() == 16);
        } else {
            fail("Error: Unexpected Parse Tree output");
        }
    }
```
