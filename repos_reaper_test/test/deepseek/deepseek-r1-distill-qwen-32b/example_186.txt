The snippet contains a merge conflict between two files that appear to be entirely different (`StarSpec.java` and `NodeIdGenerator.java`). The conflict markers indicate a situation where the same file path may have been used for two different files in different contexts.

The intent here is ambiguous because the conflicting sections belong to different packages and serve different purposes. One file appears to be related to evaluation (`org.apache.pig.impl.eval`) while the other is related to planning (`org.apache.pig.impl.plan`).

Since the conflict involves entirely different files being merged together incorrectly, the best course of action is to preserve the conflict markers as they indicate a deeper issue with the merge process itself rather than just content differences.
