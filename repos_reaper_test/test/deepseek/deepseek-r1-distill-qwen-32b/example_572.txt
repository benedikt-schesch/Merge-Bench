To resolve this merge conflict, we analyze the two approaches:

1. **HEAD Side (`jsonObject.get(facebookFieldName) == null`):**
   - Checks if the field exists by attempting to retrieve its value. If the result is `null`, it assumes the field doesn't exist.

2. **Branch Side (`!jsonObject.has(facebookFieldName)`):**
   - Directly checks if the field exists using the `has()` method, which is more precise.

The `has()` method is preferable as it accurately determines the field's presence without conflating null values. Therefore, we adopt the branch side's approach.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
      // For each Facebook-annotated field on the current Java object, pull data
      // out of the JSON object and put it in the Java object
      for (FieldWithAnnotation<Facebook> fieldWithAnnotation : fieldsWithAnnotation) {
        String facebookFieldName = getFacebookFieldName(fieldWithAnnotation);

        if (!jsonObject.has(facebookFieldName)) {
          if (MAPPER_LOGGER.isTraceEnabled()) {
            MAPPER_LOGGER
              .trace(format("No JSON value present for '%s', skipping. JSON is '%s'.", facebookFieldName, json));
          }
        }
      }
```
