The code snippet contains a merge conflict where the HEAD branch and another branch (482c393) have different implementations after the else block. The HEAD branch assigns values to both this.family and this.qualifiers, while the other branch only assigns this.lockid and then continues to another method. To resolve the conflict, we need to determine the correct behavior based on the intended purpose.

The correct behavior depends on whether both branches are correctly handling the case when there's no specific qualifier to delete and whether the family should be set accordingly. Without additional context, it's unclear, so the conflict should remain unresolved.

```java
    } else {
      // No specific qualifier to delete: delete the entire family.  Not that
      // if `family == null', we'll delete and setting this is harmless.
      this.qualifiers = DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    this.family = family;
    this.qualifiers = qualifiers == null ? DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER : qualifiers;

    this.lockid = lockid;
  }
