The conflict is between `IOUtil.toByteArray(in)` and `IOUtils.toByteArray(in)`. Both methods perform the same operation of converting an InputStream to a byte array, but they belong to different classes (`IOUtil` vs `IOUtils`). The resolution depends on which library or utility class should be used in the project.

Since I can't determine which one is correct based on the context provided, I'll keep the merge conflict as is.

```java
	 * 
	 * @param in The Resource's contents
	 * @param href The location of the resource within the epub. Example: "cover.jpg".
	 */
	public Resource(InputStream in, String href) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		this(null, IOUtil.toByteArray(in),  href, MediatypeService.determineMediaType(href));
=======
		this(null, IOUtils.toByteArray(in), href, MediatypeService.determineMediaType(href));

    /**
     * Creates a Resource that tries to load the data, but falls back to lazy loading.
     *
