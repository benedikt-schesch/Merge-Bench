The correct resolution is to keep both conditions because the comment indicates checking both server version and payload type.

```java
            // pretty quickly. Since it's most likely going to fit in the same
            // packet we send out, it adds ~zero overhead. But don't piggyback a
            // version request if the payload is already a version request or if
            // we already know the server version.
            if (client.server_version < 0 && !isVersionRequest(payload)) {
```
