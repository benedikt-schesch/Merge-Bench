The intent of both changes seems to be to return an empty list in the else block. The difference is that one version is using a raw ArrayList while the other version is explicitly specifying the generic type as Map<WhiteCardData, Object>.

Since both implementations effectively return an empty list, but the version in HEAD is more specific in its typing, we'll keep that one.

```java
      final List<WhiteCard> hand = player.getHand();
      synchronized (hand) {
        return getWhiteCardData(hand);
      }
    } else {
      return new ArrayList<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>(0);
    }
  }

  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
```
