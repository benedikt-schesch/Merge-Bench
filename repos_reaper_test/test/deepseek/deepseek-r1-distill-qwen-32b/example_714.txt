To resolve the conflict, we should ensure both pausing the media player and updating the playback state are handled. Here's the resolved code:

```java
    @Override
    public void pause() {
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            sMediaPlayer.pause();
        }
        mPlayState = PlaybackStateCompat.STATE_PAUSED;
        handlePlayState();
    }

    @Override
    public void seekTo(long msec) {
```

The above implementation first checks if the media player is available and pauses it, then updates the playback state and handles it accordingly.
