Since both sides seem to be adding imports and there's no direct code conflict, I'll merge the imports by keeping all of them.

```java
import org.andengine.input.touch.TouchEvent;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.region.ITextureRegion;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.region.TextureRegionFactory;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.render.RenderTexture;
import org.andengine.opengl.util.GLState;
import org.andengine.opengl.vbo.VertexBufferObjectManager;
import org.andengine.ui.activity.SimpleBaseGameActivity;
import org.andengine.util.modifier.ease.EaseQuadInOut;

import android.widget.Toast;
=======
```

I've merged the imports from both sides to include all the required classes. The(Vertex buffer object manager) from the remote branch and the original imports from the local branch are both included since they seem to be needed for different parts of the code.
