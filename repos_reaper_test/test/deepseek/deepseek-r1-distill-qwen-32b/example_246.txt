I resolved this conflict by keeping the version from the right side (the one with the throws clause on a separate line). The reasoning is:

1. Both versions are semantically identical - they declare the same method signature with the same throws clause

2. The only difference is formatting/styling:
   - Left side has the throws clause on the same line as the method parameters
   - Right side has the throws clause on a new line

3. The right side style is often considered better for readability, especially when the parameter list is long, as it separates the method signature from the exception specification

4. While both styles are valid, the right side version seems to follow a cleaner code formatting pattern

The resolution maintains the exact same functionality while improving code readability.
