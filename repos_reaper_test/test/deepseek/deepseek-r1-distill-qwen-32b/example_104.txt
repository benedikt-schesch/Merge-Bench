To resolve the merge conflict, both sides are defining the `isNotEqualTo` method with the same functionality but different spacing. The difference is purely stylistic. The code can be resolved by choosing one style consistently.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
public ShortAssert isNotEqualTo(short expected) {
    shorts.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
}
```

The chosen style includes the space after the method name for consistency.
