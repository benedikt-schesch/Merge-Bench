The merge conflict appears to be between two different implementations of the `isNotEqualTo` method in the `ByteAssert` class. Both implementations are attempting to assert that a byte value is not equal to an expected value, but they are using slightly different method signatures and implementations.

The key differences are:

1. The method signature in the `HEAD` branch uses a space after the comma in the parameter list (`byte expected)`), while the other branch does not (`byte expected)`).

2. The implementation in the `HEAD` branch uses `bytes.assertNotEqualTo()` with the same parameters, while the other branch appears to be using a similar method but with slightly different formatting.

Given that both implementations are trying to achieve the same semantic goal of asserting inequality between byte values, the conflict can be resolved by choosing one consistent implementation. Since the `HEAD` branch appears to have a more standard Java formatting style (with spaces after commas in parameter lists), it would be reasonable to adopt that version.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
```
