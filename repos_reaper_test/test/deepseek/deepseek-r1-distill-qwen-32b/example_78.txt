To resolve the merge conflict, I'll include both the CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND and CARDCAST- related error messages since they seem to be addressing different cases. This way, we preserve all the error handling for both custom sets and Cardcast-specific issues.

```java
    BAD_REQUEST("br", "Bad request."),
    @DuplicationAllowed
    BANNED(DisconnectReason.BANNED, "Banned."),
    CANNOT_JOIN_ANOTHER_GAME("cjag", "You cannot join another game."),
    CAPSLOCK("CL", "Try turning caps lock off."),
        "Cannot find custom deck with the given ID or URL or invalid JSON was provided.'),
    CARDCAST_CANNOT_FIND("ccf", "Cannot find Cardcast deck with given ID. If you just added this"
        + " deck to Cardcast, wait a few minutes and try again."),
    CARDCAST_INVALID_ID("cii", "Invalid Cardcast ID. Must be exactly 5 characters."),
    DO_NOT_HAVE_CARD("dnhc", "You don't have that card."),
    GAME_FULL("gf", "That game is full. Join another."),
    INVALID_CARD("ic", "Invalid card specified."),
    INVALID_GAME("ig", "Invalid game specified."),
    INVALID_ID_CODE("iid", "Identification code, if provided, must be between 8 and 100 characters,"
```
