To resolve the conflict, we should consider the intent of both changes. The left side (HEAD) uses `markReaderIndex()` and `resetReaderIndex()` to check if the buffer has enough bytes, while the right side (d543609) introduces a more efficient method `ensureReadable()` which likely achieves the same goal without modifying the reader index.

The right side's change appears to be an improvement aimed at simplifying the code without changing the functionality. Therefore, we should adopt the right side's change.

```java
      try {
        HBaseRpc.checkArrayLength(buf, length);
        // Make sure we have that many bytes readable.
        // This will have to change to be able to do streaming RPCs where we
        // deserialize parts of the response as it comes off the wire.
        ensureReadable(buf, length);
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        LOG.error("WTF?  RPC #" + rpcid + ": ", e);
      }
    }
```
