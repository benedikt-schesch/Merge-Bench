>>>>>>> The conflict is resolved by choosing the changes from the right side (commit a17acec). The reason is that `getJsonObject` is more precise for extracting a JSON object, and `User.Picture` is likely the correct target class for the picture data.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

    String picJson = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString();
    picture = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(picJson, User.Picture.class);
  }

  /**
   * The user's hometown name.
   * 
```
