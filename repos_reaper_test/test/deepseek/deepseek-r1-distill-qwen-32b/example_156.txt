To resolve the merge conflict, we'll consider the intent of both code versions. The second version passes `myPig` to `GruntParser`, ensuring proper context sharing and configuration. This maintains consistency and avoids unexpected behavior.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "illustrate b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            myPig.getPigContext().getProperties().setProperty("pig.usenewlogicalplan", "true");
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
```
