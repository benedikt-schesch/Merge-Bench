Here is the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict resolved by retaining the line from the HEAD version:

```java
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        int hash = 7;
        if (pkgr.getKeyTuple())
        {
            hash = hash * 31 + pkgr.getKeyAsTuple().hashCode();
        }
        else

```
