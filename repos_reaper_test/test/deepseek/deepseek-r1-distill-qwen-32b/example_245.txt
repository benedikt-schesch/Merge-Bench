The conflict arises from different line breaks in the assignment. Both branches agree on the code but format it differently. The resolution keeps the correct assignment with proper line breaks for readability.

```java
        // for backward compatibility
        PigInputFormat.sJob = conf;

        InputFormat inputFormat = loadFunc.getInputFormat();

        List<Long> inpLimitLists =
                (ArrayList<Long>)ObjectSerializer.deserialize(
                        conf.get("pig.inpLimits"));

        return new PigRecordReader(inputFormat, pigSplit, loadFunc, context, inpLimitLists.get(pigSplit.getInputIndex()));
    }
```
