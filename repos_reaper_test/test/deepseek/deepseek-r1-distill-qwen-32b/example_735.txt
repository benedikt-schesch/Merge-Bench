```java

        // Rotate the pictures accordingly (display is kept at 90 degrees)
        Camera.CameraInfo info =
                new android.hardware.Camera.CameraInfo();
        Camera.getCameraInfo(mCurrentFacing, info);
<<<<<<< HEAD
        orientation = (orientation + 45) / 90 * 90;

        //orientation = (360 - orientation + 45) / 90 * 90;

        int rotation = 0;
        if (info.facing == Camera.CameraInfo.CAMERA_FACING_FRONT) {
            rotation = (info.orientation - orientation + 360) % 360;
        } else {  // back-facing camera
            rotation = (info.orientation + orientation) % 360;

```

The merge conflict involves a calculation for image rotation. The intent of both sides appears to be ensuring proper image orientation based on device orientation. The conflict is between two possible approaches for adjusting the orientation. Without further context on the specific use case, I'll return the original code with the conflict preserved as is.
