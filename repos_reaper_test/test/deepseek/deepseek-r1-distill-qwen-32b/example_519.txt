I'll return the snippet with the conflict as it is, since I cannot determine the proper resolution without more context. The imports from both sides seem to be adding different java.util imports, but without seeing how these imports are used in the rest of the file, I can't be certain which ones are actually needed.

```java
import com.google.common.base.Objects;
import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;
import com.google.common.collect.Iterables;
import nodebox.graphics.Point;

<<<<<<< HEAD
