There is a merge conflict in the asString() method where one side has debug timing code (cbb20c8) and the other side doesn't. The two sides seem to be trying to:

1. Add debug timing for the asString() method execution (cbb20c8)
2. Keep the asString() implementation as is (HEAD)

The debug code is wrapped in a TwitterApplication.DEBUG check so it doesn't affect production behavior. The debug and main logic seem to coexist peacefully. I'll combine both sides by adding the debug code before the existing implementation.

```java
        mResponse = null;
        return is;
    }

    public String asString() throws ResponseException {
        if (TwitterApplication.DEBUG){
            DebugTimer.betweenStart("AS STRING");
        }
        
        String str = null;
        InputStream is = asStream();
        if (null == is) {
            return str;
```
