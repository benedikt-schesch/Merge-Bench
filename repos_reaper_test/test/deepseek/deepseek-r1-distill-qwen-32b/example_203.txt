The merge conflict arises because there are two different implementations of the `store` method:

1. The `HEAD` version returns `void` and calls another `store` method with three arguments.
2. The merged commit changes the return type to `ExecJob` and makes the method return the result of the `store` call.

Without additional context, it's unclear whether the method was intentionally modified to return an `ExecJob` or if this is an unintended change. The resolution depends on the intended functionality and whether the return value is used elsewhere in the code.

Given the ambiguity, the conflict should be preserved to allow manual resolution by the developer.

```java
     * @param id The alias to store
     * @param filename The file to which to store to
     * @throws IOException
     */

<<<<<<< HEAD
    public void store(String id, String filename) throws IOException {
        store(id, filename, PigStorage.class.getName() + "()");   // SFPig is the default store function
=======
    public ExecJob store(String id, String filename) throws IOException {
        return store(id, filename, PigStorage.class.getName() + "()");   // SFPig is the default store function
