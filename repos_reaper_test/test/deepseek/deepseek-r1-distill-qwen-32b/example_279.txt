To resolve the merge conflict, we need to integrate the validation check without disrupting existing logic.

Here is the merged code:

```java
            toPkgr.addPackager(cpkgr);
            pkCount = 1;
        }

        toPkgr.setSameMapKeyType(isSameKeyType);
        if (pkCount != total) {
            int errCode = 2146;
            String msg = "Internal Error. Inconsistency in key index found during optimization.";
            throw new OptimizerException(msg, errCode, PigException.BUG);
        }
```

Changes made:
- Removed the extra blank lines from the HEAD branch.
- Integrated the validation check which was present in the second branch.

This ensures that the validation is performed while maintaining a clean code structure.
