The conflict occurs after the closing brace of a test method, with an empty line on one side and the start of a new test method on the other. The intent appears to be adding a new testNumericGte test method, but due to the placement of the braces and empty line, it's unclear if this is simply formatting changes or if there's actual code being added or removed. Without more context, it's safer to leave the conflict as is.
