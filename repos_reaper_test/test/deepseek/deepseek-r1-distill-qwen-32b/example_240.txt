The conflict appears to be in the import statements for the Java classes. Both sides are importing different classes, but there is an overlap in `java.io.IOException`. The intent seems to be about adding additional import statements from one side to the other.

Since the imports are additive and there's no direct conflict in the imports themselves, I will merge the imports from both sides.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
package org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collection;
```

Note: I merged the imports from both sides, removing duplicates while keeping all necessary imports.
