The code contains a merge conflict where one side declares `isDistinct()` as `public abstract boolean`, and the other side as just `boolean`. I'll analyze the intent of both:

1. `public abstract boolean isDistinct();` (HEAD)
   - Makes the method public (accessible from anywhere)
   - Declares it abstract (must be implemented by subclasses)
   - Specifies return type boolean
   - This is typical for an interface or abstract class

2. `boolean isDistinct();` (branch 1488b22)
   - Package-private (not explicitly public)
   - No abstract modifier
   - Same return type
   - This might be intended for a concrete implementation

Since this appears to be a base class/abstract class context, the `public abstract` version is more likely the correct approach as it preserves the abstract contract that subclasses must implement. The other version seems too restrictive.
