The conflict involves the initialization of `GruntParser`. The original code initializes it with just the script, while the other version also passes a `Pig` instance (`myPig`). The intent of passing `myPig` is likely to ensure proper Pig context management.

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "describe b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

<<<<<<< HEAD
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));
=======
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
>>>>>>> 2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```

The resolution preserves the version that includes the Pig instance `myPig` as it's essential for proper context management.
