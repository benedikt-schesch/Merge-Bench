Both sides of the merge are attempting to set `repoInfo.branch`, but they have different approaches:

1. HEAD side is setting it to `selectedBranch.getName()` - the branch name
2. The other side is setting it to `selectedBranch.getCommit().getSha()` - the commit SHA

This appears to be a semantic conflict where one side wants to track the branch name while the other wants to track the commit identifier.

Since the intent is ambiguous and I'm unsure which approach is correct, I'll return the original snippet with the conflict:

```java
  private void openCommits() {
    if (selectedBranch != null) {
      RepoInfo repoInfo = new RepoInfo();
      repoInfo.owner = repo.getOwner().getLogin();
      repoInfo.name = repo.name;
<<<<<<< HEAD
      repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getName();
=======
      repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getCommit().getSha();
>>>>>>> 42bfc423b52bed1c5d64d35cc1100a32b48968d6
      Intent intent = BranchCommitsActivity.createLauncherIntent(this, repoInfo);
      startActivity(intent);
    }
  }
```
