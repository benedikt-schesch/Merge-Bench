To resolve the merge conflict, you should first understand the intent of both changes:

1. The `HEAD` version provides a concise one-liner animation setup
2. The commit `c923751` version breaks the animation setup into multiple lines for better readability

Both versions achieve the exact same animation behavior, they just differ in code style. Since this is a style difference rather than a functional difference, you can resolve this by:

1. Keeping the concise version if your team prefers brevity
2. Using the formatted version if your team prefers readability
3. Standardizing on one style to use throughout your codebase

Since there's no clear semantic difference, you can choose either version. For this resolution, I'll format it with the more readable multi-line version:

```java
        setTranslationX(finalX);
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideClose() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
        animate()
            .translationX(-params.leftMargin)
            .setDuration(SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS)
            .start();
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
        // Add implementation for opening animation if needed
    }
```

However, since you requested to preserve the exact conflict format if the intent is ambiguous, here's the version with the conflict preserved:

```java
        setTranslationX(finalX);
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideClose() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
<<<<<<< HEAD
        animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
=======
        animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(
                SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

This preserves the exact code and conflict markers as originally provided.
