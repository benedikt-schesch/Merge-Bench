To resolve the merge conflict, we will use the approach from the 3df3b40acb branch to construct the filter file location but also include the TestNGConfigurator initialization from the HEAD branch. This ensures both functionalities are preserved.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
    {
        checkNotNull(environment, "No runtime environment is configured. Maybe because the project has no jdk.");

        runtimeEnvironment = environment;
        this.eventQueue = eventQueue;
        String filterFileLocation = environment.getWorkingDirectory().getAbsolutePath() + File.separator
                        + "infinitest.filters";
        File filterFile = new File(filterFileLocation);
        filterList = new RegexFileFilter(filterFile);
        testNGConfigurator = new TestNGConfigurator(filterFile);
        runnerClass = MultiProcessRunner.class;
        controller = new SingleLockConcurrencyController();
    }

    /**
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Extract `filterFileLocation` from the 3df3 branch:** Construct the filter file path using the working directory and "infinitest.filters".
2. **Create a `File` object `filterFile`:** Use the constructed location to create a `File` object. This allows us to reuse it for both `filterList` and `testNGConfigurator`.
3. **Initialize `filterList`:** Pass `filterFile` to `RegexFileFilter`.
4. **Initialize `testNGConfigurator`:** Pass the same `filterFile` to `TestNGConfigurator`, as done in the HEAD branch.
5. **Retain other configurations:** Keep `runnerClass` and `controller` as they are.

This merge maintains the filter setup from both branches without duplicating or omitting necessary components.
