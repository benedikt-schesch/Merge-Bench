The code snippet contains a merge conflict where the `venue` field in one branch is of type `Location`, while in the other branch it is of type `Venue`. Both fields serve a similar purpose of representing the event's location but use different types. 

Depending on the context of the project, one type may be more appropriate than the other. If `Location` and `Venue` are interchangeable, either side can be chosen. If they serve different purposes, further analysis is needed.
