To resolve the conflict, the correct condition should check if the node `u` has at most one child, allowing proper splicing or searching for a successor.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
	/**
	 * Remove the node u from the binary search tree
	 * @param u
	 */
	protected void remove(Node u) {
		if (u.left == null || u.right == null) {
			splice(u);
		} else {
			Node w = u.right;
			while (w.left != nil) 
				w = w.left;
```
