The conflict is between using `myKey.getIndex()` and `keyWritable.getIndex()`. Without additional context, it's unclear which variable (`myKey` or `keyWritable`) is the correct one to use here. Both could potentially represent similar concepts but with different lifecycles or usages.

Since the intent is ambiguous, I'll return the snippet with the conflict unchanged.

```java
    public Result getNext() throws ExecException {
        if (bags == null) {
            return new Result(POStatus.STATUS_EOP, null);
        }

        byte origIndex = myKey.getIndex();

        byte origIndex = keyWritable.getIndex();

        int index = (int)origIndex;
        index &= idxPart;

        if (index >= packagers.size() || index < 0) {

```
