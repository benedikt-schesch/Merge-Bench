I cannot resolve this merge conflict definitively because the difference appears to be a simple class inheritance change from `FacebookType` to `AbstractFacebookType`. Without additional context or a clear intention to prefer one parent class over the other, it's not possible to determine the correct resolution. 

Here is the unmodified snippet with the conflict:

```java
 * This is used by several Graph API types, e.g. <tt>{@link Post}</tt> and <tt>{@link Page}</tt>.
