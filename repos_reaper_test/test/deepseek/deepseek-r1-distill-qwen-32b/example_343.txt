To resolve the conflict in the given Java code snippet, we'll consider the semantic intent of both branches. The branch 'fe1b8ab' marks the method as obsolete by adding a `throw` statement, while the HEAD branch may still rely on the existing functionality.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Identify the Conflict:** The method has differing access modifiers and functionality between branches.
2. **Analyze Intent:** The other branch aims to deprecate the method, while the HEAD expects it to function as before.
3. **Resolve:** Choose to keep the method functional to maintain compatibility. If deprecation is the goal, ensure callers are updated first.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
	 *            Parameters
	 * @param manager
	 *            Reference back to business layer
	 * @return Parsed JSON object, empty object on error.
	 */
	protected JsonNode query(String command, JsonNode parameters,
			INotifiableManager manager) {
		URLConnection uc = null;
		try {
			final ObjectMapper mapper = Client.MAPPER;

			if (mUrl == null) {
				throw new NoSettingsException();
```

Both changes from the other branch (deprecation and access modifier) were considered but reverted to maintain existing functionality.
