The merge conflict in the code is a formatting difference with no change in intent. Both sides are checking if `playerCards` and `blackCard` are not null and if the size of playerCards matches the pick count from blackCard. The only difference is a line break in the HEAD version. I'll merge them by removing the line break for consistency.

```java
          if (!roundPlayers.contains(player)) {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
            break;
          }
          final List<WhiteCard> playerCards = playedCards.getCards(player);
          if (playerCards != null && blackCard != null && playerCards.size() == blackCard.getPick()) {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
          } else {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.PLAYING;
          }
        }
```
