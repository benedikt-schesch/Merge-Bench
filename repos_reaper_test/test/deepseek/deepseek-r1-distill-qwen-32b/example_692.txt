To resolve this merge conflict, we need to ensure that all relevant properties related to failure notifications are included in the final code.

```java
>>>>>>> d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5

	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsProperty        = new StringProperty("failureNotifications").hint("Notifications after failed execution of action").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsPartialProperty = new StringProperty("failureNotificationsPartial").hint("CSS selector for partial to display as failure notification").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsEventProperty   = new StringProperty("failureNotificationsEvent").hint("Event to raise for failure notifications").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<Integer> failureNotificationsDelayProperty  = new IntProperty("failureNotificationsDelay").hint("Delay before hiding failure notifications").defaultValue(5000).partOfBuiltInSchema();

	public static final Property<String> successBehaviourProperty = new StringProperty("successBehaviour").hint("Behaviour after successful execution of action").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successPartialProperty   = new StringProperty("successPartial").hint("CSS selector for partial to refresh on success").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successURLProperty       = new StringProperty("successURL").hint("URL to navigate to on success").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successEventProperty     = new StringProperty("successEvent").hint("Event to raise on success").partOfBuiltInSchema();
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Conflict:** The delay property `\ failureNotificationsDelayProperty` is present in one branch but missing in another, indicating a potential removal or divergence.

2. **Determine Intent:** The delay property adds a default timeout, which is a logical enhancement to the failure notification handling. It's beneficial to retain this functionality.

3. **Combine Changes:** Since there's no overlap in the affected lines beyond the property declaration, we can safely include the delay property without disrupting other code.

4. **Result:** The merged code includes all failure notification properties, preserving functionality and configuration capabilities.

This resolution ensures that all relevant failure notification settings are present, providing a complete and functional configuration.
