Let me analyze this merge conflict:

The conflict is in the `buildPostRequest` method where there are two different implementations:

1. The HEAD version returns a new `MockLowLevelHttpRequest()` without passing any arguments
2. The f1253614 version returns a new `MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url)`

Given that the other methods like `buildGetRequest` are consistently using the url parameter and passing it to the MockLowLevelHttpRequest constructor, it makes sense that the intended implementation should also pass the url parameter.

This suggests that the correct resolution would be to use the version from f1253614 that includes the url parameter, as it maintains consistency with the surrounding code.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPostRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPutRequest(String url) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
