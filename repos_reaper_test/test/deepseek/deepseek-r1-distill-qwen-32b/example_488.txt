Based on the analysis, the conflict should be resolved by selecting the `BitmapTextureAtlas` declaration as it aligns better with the use of multiple TextureRegions. Here's the resolved code:

```java
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private Scene mScene;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mOnScreenControlTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mOnScreenControlTexture;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mOnScreenControlBaseTextureRegion;
	private TextureRegion mOnScreenControlKnobTextureRegion;

	private boolean mPlaceOnScreenControlsAtDifferentVerticalLocations = false;
```

The change to `BitmapTextureAtlas` supports efficient management of multiple texture regions, which is better suited for the existing TextureRegion variables.
