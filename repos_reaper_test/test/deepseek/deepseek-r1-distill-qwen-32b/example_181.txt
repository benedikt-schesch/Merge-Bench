Both sides of the merge conflict are trying to define the `getIntermed()` method, but with different implementation intents. The side with `Initial.class.getName()` seems to be reusing the initial class, while the side with `Intermediate.class.getName()` is introducing a new class name to match the method name.

Given the context, the more logical implementation is to return `Intermediate.class.getName()` to match the method name `getIntermed()`, as this better represents the intermediate state between initial and final states.

Let's resolve the conflict:

```java
    public String getInitial() {
        return Initial.class.getName();
    }

    public String getIntermed() {
        return Intermediate.class.getName();
    }

    public String getFinal() {
        return Final.class.getName();
    }
```
