To resolve this merge conflict, I considered the imports and the package structure. The left side doesn't import getNames, while the right side does. Since getNames could be necessary for functionality, I added the import to ensure the code compiles and functions correctly.

```java
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
 * THE SOFTWARE.
 */
package com.restfb.types;

import static com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames;
import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromLongFormat;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;

import com.restfb.Facebook;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper;
