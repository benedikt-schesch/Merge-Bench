To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine the correct approach that aligns with the intended functionality. The local changes fetch specific collections, while the remote change fetches all in one go. Considering efficiency and reduction of redundant calls, the remote approach is preferable.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
                am.setUserData(account, MANDELLA_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATIONTIME_HATCHET,
                        String.valueOf(accessTokenExpiresIn));
                ensureAccessTokens();
            }
        }
        // The remote change uses fetchAll() which is more efficient
        CollectionManager.getInstance().fetchAll();
        // Kept the broadcastConfigTestResult as it's essential for configuration
        AuthenticatorManager.broadcastConfigTestResult(getId(),
                AuthenticatorManager.CONFIG_TEST_RESULT_PLUGINTYPE_AUTHUTILS,
                AuthenticatorManager.CONFIG_TEST_RESULT_TYPE_SUCCESS);
    }
```
