To resolve this conflict, we should adopt the Fluent Assertions style which is more descriptive and commonly used in the project, as seen in surrounding tests.

```java

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_fallback() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.json", attachmentData.getBytes());
    assertThat(att).hasContentType("application/octet-stream");
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_manual() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";

```
