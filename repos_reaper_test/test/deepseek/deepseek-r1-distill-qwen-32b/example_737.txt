I agree with the above assessment. The code presents a partial implementation with an incomplete `onAnimationStart` method and an empty `onAnimationEnd` method, making the exact intended behavior unclear. Without further context or completion of the implementation, it's safest to leave the code as is with the existing merge conflict.

Here is the code snippet preserved with the conflict:

```java
     * Normally closes the review drawer (animation)
     */
    public void close() {
        mIsOpen = false;
        animate().setDuration(DRAWER_TOGGLE_DURATION).setInterpolator(new DecelerateInterpolator())
<<<<<<< HEAD
                .translationY(-getMeasuredHeight()).alpha(0.0f).setListener(new Animator.AnimatorListener() {
            @Override
            public void onAnimationStart(Animator animator) {
=======
                .translationY(-getMeasuredHeight()).alpha(0.0f)
                .setListener(new Animator.AnimatorListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onAnimationStart(Animator animator) {
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c

                    }

                    @Override
                    public void onAnimationEnd(Animator animator) {

```
