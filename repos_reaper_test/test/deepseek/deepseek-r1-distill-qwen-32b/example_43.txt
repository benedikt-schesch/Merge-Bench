The conflict is about which field the method synchronizes on - `spectator` vs `spectators`. Given the context of the method removing a spectator, it likely operates on a collection of spectators rather than a single one. Synchronizing on `spectators` makes more sense for thread safety when modifying the collection.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
  }

  /**
   * Remove a spectator from the game.
   * <br/>
   * Synchronizes on {@link #spectators}.
   *
   * @param user Spectator to remove from the game.
   */
  public void removeSpectator(final User user) {
    logger.info(String.format("Removing spectator %s from game %d.", user.toString(), id));

```
