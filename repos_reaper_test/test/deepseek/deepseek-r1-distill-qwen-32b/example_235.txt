To resolve the merge conflict, the comment needs to clearly convey that another instance is responsible for reading the first record. The correct phrasing should be definitive, indicating reliance rather than possibility.

```java

    public void bindTo(String fileName, BufferedPositionedInputStream in, long offset, long end) throws IOException {
        this.in = in;
        this.end = end;
        // Since we are not block aligned we throw away the first
        // record and count on a different instance to read it
        if (offset != 0)
            getNext();
    }

    public Tuple getNext() throws IOException {

```
