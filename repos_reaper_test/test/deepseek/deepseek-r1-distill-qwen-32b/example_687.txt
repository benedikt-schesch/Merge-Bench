To resolve the conflict, we analyze the intent of both changes. The left side has a more verbose message about resource access permissions, while the right side streamlines the message, adds sorting for clarity, and uses an exclamation mark for emphasis. Both are aiming to communicate ambiguity issues but with slightly different wording and structure.

The more precise and user-friendly approach is the right side, which sorts the ambiguous principals and uses a clearer message structure.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
    + "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
    + "\tFor the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for grants or node ownership during data deployment.\n"
    + "\tBecause of this ambiguity, node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported!\n\n"
    + "\t" + ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
    + "\n\n\tConsider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.\n"
    + "###############################################################################"
);
```
