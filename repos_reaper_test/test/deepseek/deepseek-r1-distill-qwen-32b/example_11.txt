```java
		if (current != null) {
			return current;
		}
		
		((SpoutScheduler)Spout.getScheduler()).addAsyncManager(region);
		if (Spout.getEngine().getPlatform() == Platform.CLIENT) {
			region.startMeshGeneratorThread();
		}

		int threshold = warnThreshold.get();
		if (regionsLoaded.getAndIncrement() > threshold) {
			Spout.getLogger().info("Warning: number of spout regions exceeds " + threshold + " when creating (" +
                x + ", " + y + ", " + z + ")");

```

The changes from both sides are complementary. The changes from HEAD add the `region` to the `SpoutScheduler`, while the changes from the other branch add platform-specific behavior for the CLIENT platform. Both sets of changes can be preserved as they do not conflict with each other and serve different purposes.
