The merge conflict in the import statements can be resolved by using the wildcard import as it includes all the necessary classes without explicitly listing them. This makes the code cleaner and is sufficient for the required imports.

```java
import com.restfb.types.DeviceCode;
import com.restfb.util.EncodingUtils;
import com.restfb.util.StringUtils;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.*;

import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
