The code has a merge conflict where one side uses `BitmapTexture` and the other uses `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Given that the surrounding code declares multiple `TiledTextureRegion` fields, which are typically managed by a `BitmapTextureAtlas`, it's appropriate to merge the change to `BitmapTextureAtlas`.

```java

	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;

	private TiledTextureRegion mBoxFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mCircleFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mTriangleFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mHexagonFaceTextureRegion;

```
