To resolve this conflict, we should preserve the intent of both implementations. Both `Arrays.asList()` and `Collections.singletonList()` create an immutable list containing a single element. 

However, the difference lies in their usage:
- `Arrays.asList()` is typically used for wrapping arrays.
- `Collections.singletonList()` is more explicit for creating a single-element list.

In this context, since we're creating a new list with one element, `Collections.singletonList()` might be more appropriate.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
          cardData.add(Collections.singletonList(WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()));
```

The change preserves the intended functionality while making the code more explicit about creating a single-element list.
