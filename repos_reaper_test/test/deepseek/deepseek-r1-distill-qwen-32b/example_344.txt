The code appears to have a merge conflict related to exception handling and logging. The conflict arises between the HEAD version and another commit (fe1b8ab28f6b9e6d70825a39c04c0384351cd5a8). The intent of both sides seems to be around handling exceptions from the URL connection and JSON processing.

The merge conflict is somewhat ambiguous as to which side represents the correct code path after the logging and return statement. However, the return statement after logging (`return ret;`) suggests that it was meant to terminate the method, but the surrounding context suggests that the exception handling should follow after.

Given the ambiguity, I will try to resolve this by preserving the proper exception handling and cleaning up the debug/log statements:

Here's the resolved code:

```java
			jp.setCodec(mapper);
			final JsonNode ret = jp.readValueAs(JsonNode.class);
			Log.v("Connection", "Command " + command + ": " + data.toString());
			Log.v("Connection", ret.toString());
			return ret;
		} catch (MalformedURLException e) {
			if(manager != null) {
				manager.onError(e);
			}
		} catch (IOException e) {
			if(manager != null) {
				manager.onError(e);
			}
		}
```

The key changes:
- Removed debug prints (`manage Misc` is removed)
- Added proper exception handling for IOException
- Maintained consistent manager error reporting
- Kept the return statement after proper logging

The resolution assumes that the intent was to:
1. Attempt the JSON parsing and logging
2. Return the result if successful
3. Handle exceptions appropriately and report errors through the manager

If this resolution doesn't align with the intended functionality, please provide additional context or clarify the requirements.
