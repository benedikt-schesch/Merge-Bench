To resolve this merge conflict, we should consider the test framework being used.

Since this appears to be a standard JUnit test, we should use `assertEquals` rather than `assertThat...isEqualTo`.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
      for (FacebookType type : page) {
        counter++;
      }
    }

    assertEquals(18, counter);
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_snapshot() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();
```
