To resolve the merge conflict, we analyze the intent of both changes. The first version keeps `ABActivityViewer` as a standalone interface, while the second adds `TaskController` as a super interface. Extending `TaskController` likely adds necessary methods for task management. 

Since both methods are compatible and beneficial, the correct approach is to have `ABActivityViewer` extend `TaskController` to leverage its functionalities.

```java
 * Date: 7/17/14.
 * <p/>
 * MVP的View层，UI相关，Activity需要实现该interface
 * 它会包含一个Presenter的引用，当有事件发生（比如按钮点击后），会调用Presenter层的方法
 */
public interface ABActivityViewer extends TaskController {

    /**
     * 显示Toast信息
     *
     * @param message
```
