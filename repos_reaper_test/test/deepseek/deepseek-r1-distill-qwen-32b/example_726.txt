The merge conflict arises from two separate changes to the `CardStack` class: one introducing constants and a margin variable, and the other adding rotation and gravity flags. To resolve this, we'll merge both additions while preserving all existing fields. The result includes all variables without conflicts.

```java

import java.util.ArrayList;


public class CardStack extends RelativeLayout {

    public static final int DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN = 20;

    private int mStackMargin = DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN;
    private boolean mEnableRotation;
    private int mGravity;
    private int mColor = -1;
    private int mIndex = 0;
    private int mNumVisible = 4;
    private boolean canSwipe = true;
    private ArrayAdapter<?> mAdapter;

```
