```java
                    LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "Class " + defSource
                            + " is not supported");
                    System.exit(1);
                }
            } else if (!jaxRsResources.isEmpty()) {
                definition = getDefinitionFromJaxrsSources(defSource, useSectionNamingPackageStrategy, applicationName,
                        endpoint, jaxRsResources);
            }
        }
