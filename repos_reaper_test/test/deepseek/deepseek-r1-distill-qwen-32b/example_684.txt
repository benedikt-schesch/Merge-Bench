I'll help resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intent of both changes.

The main purpose of the code is to display a warning about missing principals during data deployment. Both versions are trying to accomplish this, but there are two key differences:

1. The first version (HEAD) describes the issue as being related to "resource access permissions" while the second version (83418db) uses the term "grants". The term "grants" is more precise in this context.

2. The second version adds a stream-sort to the missingPrincipals list before joining them, which makes the displayed list more readable by sorting the entries first.

Here's how the conflict should be resolved to combine the best of both changes:

```java
		applyConfigurationFileIfExists(context, source.resolve("post-data-deploy.conf"), DEPLOYMENT_DATA_IMPORT_STATUS);

		if (!missingPrincipals.isEmpty()) {

			final String title = "Missing Principal(s)";
			final String text = "The following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during <b>data deployment</b>.<br>"
					+ "Because of these missing grants/ownerships, <b>node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported</b>!"
					+ "<ul><li>" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>")) + "</li></ul>"
					+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf\">pre-data-deploy.conf</a> and re-importing.";

			logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
					+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
```

The final version keeps the clearer "grants" language from the second version while also incorporating the stream-sort for better readability.
