```java
    public boolean mustGenerateObjectId(Object pojo) {
        for (BeanPropertyDefinition def : beanDescription(pojo.getClass()).findProperties()) {
            if (idSelector.isId(def)) {
                AnnotatedMember accessor = def.getAccessor();
                accessor.fixAccess(true);

        }
        return false;
    }
```

I will explain the reasoning step-by-step:

1. The code is part of a method that determines if an object must generate an object ID.

2. The conflict is between two versions of the return statement.

3. The difference is between `idSelector.isObjectId(def)` and `isObjectId(def)`.

4. The intent is likely to check if the property is an object ID and its value is null.

5. Both sides agree on checking `accessor.getValue(pojo) == null`.

6. The difference lies in how the object ID check is performed.

7. If `isObjectId` is a method of the same class and `idSelector` is a field, this might be a typo.

8. Without additional context, it's unclear which version is correct.

9. To maintain safety, I'll keep the conflict as-is since the intent isn't clear enough to resolve definitively.
