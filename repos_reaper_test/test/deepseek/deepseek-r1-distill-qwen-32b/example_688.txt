The conflict was in the import statements section. Both sides were trying to import necessary classes for the code to compile and function properly.

- `java.io.InputStream` is needed for handling input streams
- `java.net.URI` is needed for URI handling
- `java.util.Map` is needed for working with key-value pairs
- `static org.structr.rest.common.HttpHelper.getAsStream` is needed for the static import of the getAsStream method

Both sets of imports are necessary for the code to compile and work correctly, so I've merged them together to include both. This ensures all required functionality remains available while maintaining access to the static utility method.
