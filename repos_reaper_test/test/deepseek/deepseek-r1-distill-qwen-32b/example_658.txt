The conflict appears to be about adding an additional overloaded `executePost` method that accepts a `Map<String, String>` headers parameter. Both methods are valid and serve different purposes, with the second one providing more flexibility by allowing custom headers to be passed. 

Since both methods serve different use cases and don't conflict semantically, I've retained both methods in the merged code. The first version without headers can be used when no custom headers are needed, while the second version allows for more flexibility when headers are required.
