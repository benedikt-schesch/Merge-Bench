The code snippet contains a merge conflict where both sides are attempting to modify the same anonymous `ResourceServlet` class. The two main changes are:

1. Adding a `serialVersionUID` field on the local branch (HEAD)
2. Setting properties `applyLastModified` and `contentType` on the remote branch (b26c4f8)

These two changes are independent and can be safely combined to maintain both the serialization version and the configuration settings.

Here's the resolved code combining both changes:

```java
        return new DefaultResourceLoader();
    }

    private ResourceServlet concreteResourceServlet(final String location) {
        return new ResourceServlet() {
            private static final long serialVersionUID = 4602656496188884537L;
			{
                setApplyLastModified(true);
                setContentType("image/png");
            }
```
