To resolve this merge conflict, I analyzed the intent of both sides. Both branches are checking if the response is a `VersionMismatchException` and if `server_version` is unknown, then setting it to `SERVER_VERSION_092_OR_ABOVE`. The conflict arises due to differing indentation. Since the logic is identical, I'll resolve by choosing one branch's formatting for consistency.

```java
    public ProtocolVersionCB(final Channel chan) {
      this.chan = chan;
    }

    public Long call(final Object response) throws Exception {
      if (response instanceof VersionMismatchException) {
        if (server_version == SERVER_VERSION_UNKNWON) {
          // If we get here, it's because we tried to handshake with a server
          // running HBase 0.92 or above, but using a pre-0.92 handshake.  So
          // we know we have to handshake differently.
          server_version = SERVER_VERSION_092_OR_ABOVE;
        }
      }
    }
```
