To resolve this conflict, we analyze the semantic intent of both versions. Both aim to inform about ambiguous principals affecting deployment. The key difference is in wording, formatting, and punctuation. The second version sorts the principals and adds a more emphatic punctuation. Choosing the latter improves clarity and emphasis.

Resolved snippet:

```java
			}

			if (!ambiguousPrincipals.isEmpty()) {

				final String title = "Ambiguous Principal(s)";
				final String text = "For the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for grants or node ownership during <b>deployment</b>.<br>"
						+ "Because of this ambiguity, <b>node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported</b>!"
						+ "<ul><li>" + ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>")) + "</li></ul>"
						+ "Consider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.";

				logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
						+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
```
