The conflict in the `isHelpNeeded()` method involves different conditions and variable names. The correct resolution combines both sides' logic by using `helpNeeded` and including `isListConfig()` for a comprehensive check.

```java
    public String getConfigValue() {
        return config;
    }

    public boolean isHelpNeeded() {
        return helpNeeded || !(isListConfig() || isBake() || isRunServer() || isInit() || source != null || destination != null);
    }

    public boolean isRunServer() {
        return runServer;
    }
```
