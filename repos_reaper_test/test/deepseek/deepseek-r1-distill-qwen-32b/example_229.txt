The two versions of the code have slightly different approaches to creating the temp file:
- The HEAD version uses a fixed "test.txt" filename
- The commit version derives the filename from the test name with ".txt" extension

Since both approaches achieve the same goal of creating a temp file but with different naming strategies, and there's no clear indicator of which approach is better without more context, I'll keep the commit version since it provides more context about which test created the file through the test name.

```java
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }

    @Test
    public void testBigGroupAll() throws Throwable {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        int LOOP_COUNT = 4*1024;
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
=======
        int LOOP_COUNT = 4*1024;
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile(this.getName(), ".txt");
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(tmpFile));
        for(int i = 0; i < LOOP_COUNT; i++) {
            ps.println(i);
        }
        ps.close();
