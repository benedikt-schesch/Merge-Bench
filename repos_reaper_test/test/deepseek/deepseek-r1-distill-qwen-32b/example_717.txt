The merge conflict in the `getPosition()` method involves the placement of the `MediaPlayer` declaration relative to its null check. 

- **HEAD (current branch):** Declares and initializes `sMediaPlayer` before checking if it is null.
- **Other branch:** Removes the declaration but retains the null check, which would cause a compilation error because `sMediaPlayer` isn't declared.

To resolve this, we keep the declaration and check as in the HEAD side to ensure correct functionality.

```java
        }
    }

    @Override
    public long getPosition() {
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null)
            return sMediaPlayer.getCurrentPosition();
        return 0;
    }
```
