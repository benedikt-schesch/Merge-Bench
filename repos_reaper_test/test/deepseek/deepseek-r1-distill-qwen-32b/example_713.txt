To resolve this merge conflict, we need to determine the intent behind both changes.

The first change (HEAD) implements direct MediaPlayer control by starting playback if the player exists and isn't currently playing. The second change (ab8ddfc) updates the play state and handles it, possibly for UI or state management purposes.

Both pieces of functionality seem important and complementary rather than conflicting. The resolution should preserve both semantic intentions.

Here's the combined resolution that maintains both playback control and state management:

```java
        EventBus.getDefault().register(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void play() {
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null && !sMediaPlayer.isPlaying())
            sMediaPlayer.start();
        mPlayState = PlaybackStateCompat.STATE_PLAYING;
        handlePlayState();
    }

    @Override
    public void pause() {
```
