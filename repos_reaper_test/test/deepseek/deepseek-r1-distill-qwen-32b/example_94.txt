I recommend resolving the conflict by updating the Game constructor call to use the newer version with 14 parameters, as it likely reflects the current state of the Game class. This change preserves the test's intent while ensuring compatibility with the updated code.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
    // remove game 1 using its own method -- this should be how it always happens in production
    gameManager.destroyGame(1);
    // make sure it re-uses that id
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
    gameManager.getGames().put(1,
        new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));
    assertEquals(-1, gameManager.get().intValue());

    // remove game 1 out from under it, to make sure it'll fix itself
    gameManager.getGames().remove(1);
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
```

Note: The assertion after adding the game may still need review for correctness, as the expected value appears inconsistent with the ID set.
