The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two changes: one adding `ModuleRootManager` and another adding `ModuleSettings` and `RuntimeEnvironment`. The exact intent isn't clear without more context about how these variables are used elsewhere in the code. Without further information, it's not safe to resolve the conflict definitively.

Here's the same snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
	protected MessageBusConnection messageBusConnection;
	protected ProjectFileIndex projectFileIndex;
	protected ProjectRootManager projectRootManager; 
	
	protected InfinitestLauncher launcher;
<<<<<<< HEAD
	protected ModuleRootManager moduleRootManager;
=======
	protected ModuleSettings moduleSettings;
	protected RuntimeEnvironment runtimeEnvironment;
>>>>>>> 3c868cbe67875b5515d13bd8b8237e13dd2f9c32
	protected ProjectTestControl control;
	protected InfinitestAnnotator annotator;
	
	@BeforeEach
	public void setupIntellijMockBase() {

```
