The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two branches where the intent of both sides is ambiguous. On one side, it is deserializing the JSON object into a ProfilePictureSource class, while the other side is extracting a URL from the JSON object. Since the intent is unclear, the conflict remains unresolved.

```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

<<<<<<< HEAD
    JsonObject picData = rawPicture.get("data").asObject();
    if (picData != null) {
      picture = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(picData.toString(), ProfilePictureSource.class);
    }
  }

=======
    JsonObject picData = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data");
    if (picData != null) {
      picture = picData.getString("url");
    }
  }
