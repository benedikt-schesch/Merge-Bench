The merge conflict involves the initialization of `contentType`. Both parties agree on the field but differ on whether to initialize it to `null`. Since instance variables in Java are default-initialized to `null`, initializing here is redundant. However, initializing explicitly can clarify intent. Let's keep the explicit initialization.

```java

  private byte[] data;

  private InputStream dataStream;

  private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

  /**

```
