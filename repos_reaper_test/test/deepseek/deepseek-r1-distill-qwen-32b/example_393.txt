To resolve the merge conflict, we need to address both the typo correction and the addition of the public modifier. Here's the resolved code:

```java
		assertStatusIs(noTestsRun());
		verify(coreRegistry).addCore(eq(projectAUri), any(InfinitestCore.class));
	}

	@Test
	public void shouldFireAnEvent() throws CoreException {
		InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 10);

		workspace.addUpdateListeners(new UpdateListener() {
			@Override
			public void projectsUpdated() {
				updates++;
```

Changes made:
1. Corrected the typo `prepateCore` to `prepareCore`.
2. Added the `public` modifier to the method as per the merged commit.

This resolves the merge conflict by incorporating both changes from the conflicting branches.
