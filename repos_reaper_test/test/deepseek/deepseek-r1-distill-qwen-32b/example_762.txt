I'll analyze the conflict to determine the correct resolution based on intent and semantics.

The conflict is in the DeleteRequest constructor where there's a difference in how the fourth argument is passed:

- The HEAD version passes `null`
- The conflicting commit passes `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER`

Given the context of a DeleteRequest and the parameter names, this appears to be related to handling column families in deletions. Typically in HBase:

1. `null` might indicate deleting all columns in the family
2. `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER` (a constant typically defined elsewhere) is specifically used for deleting the entire column family

Since both changes seem to be trying to accomplish the same semantic goal of deleting a column family, but using different approaches, I'll resolve the conflict by choosing the more specific `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER` value.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
>>>>>>> 2d0abace41a98eccdcd180deee15181c7238898d
   */
  public DeleteRequest(final byte[] table,
                       final byte[] key,
                       final byte[] family) {
    this(table, key, family, DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER, RowLock.NO_LOCK);
=======
    this(table, key, family, DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER, RowLock.NO_LOCK);
>>>>>>> 2d0abace41a98eccdcd180deee15181c7238898d
  }

  /**

   * <strong>These byte arrays will NOT be copied.</strong>
