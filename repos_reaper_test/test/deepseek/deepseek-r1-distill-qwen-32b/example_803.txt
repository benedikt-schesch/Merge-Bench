The provided code snippet includes a merge conflict within the `serialize` method. The conflict is between an empty block in the HEAD version and additional version-checking logic in the d543609 branch. To resolve this conflict, we need to integrate both changes while maintaining the intended functionality.

Here's the conflict-resolution:

```java
    return size;
  }

  /** Serializes this request.  */
  ChannelBuffer serialize(final byte server_version) {
    if (server_version >= RegionClient.SERVER_VERSION_095_OR_ABOVE) {
      throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Row locks are not supported with"
                                              + " this version of HBase ("
                                              + server_version + ").");
    }
    final ChannelBuffer buf = newBuffer(server_version,
                                        predictSerializedSize());
    buf.writeInt(2);  // Number of parameters.

    writeHBaseByteArray(buf, region.name());
```

The solution integrates the version check from the d543609 branch before proceeding with the existing serialization logic, ensuring that both intent and functionality are preserved.
