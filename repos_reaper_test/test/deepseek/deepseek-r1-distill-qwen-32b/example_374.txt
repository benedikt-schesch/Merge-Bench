The snippet shows a merge conflict where the `@Beta` annotation is present in one branch and not in the other. The method `trustCertificates` takes a trustStore, mtlsKeyStore, and mtlsKeyStorePassword and sets a flag if mtlsKeyStore is present.

Since the intent of whether the method should be annotated as `@Beta` is ambiguous, the conflict cannot be resolved without additional context. Therefore, the snippet is returned with the conflict preserved.

```java
     *     or {@link SecurityUtils#loadKeyStoreFromCertificates})
     * @param mtlsKeyStore key store for client certificate and key to establish mutual TLS. (use
     *     for example {@link SecurityUtils#createMtlsKeyStore(InputStream)})
     * @param mtlsKeyStorePassword password for mtlsKeyStore parameter
