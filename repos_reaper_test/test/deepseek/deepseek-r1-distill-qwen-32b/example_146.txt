It appears both sides of the merge conflict are modifying the access level of the `empty` variable in the `POStore` class. 

On one side, the access was changed to `protected` while the other side kept it as `private`. 

Given the surrounding code context, it's unclear whether the `empty` variable should be protected or private. Without additional context about how `empty` is used in other classes, it's best to preserve both changes by keeping one of them as private.

Here is the preserved code:

```java
 *
 */
public class POStore extends PhysicalOperator {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private static Result empty = new Result(POStatus.STATUS_NULL, null);
    transient private StoreFuncInterface storer;
    transient private POStoreImpl impl;
    transient private String counterName = null;
    private FileSpec sFile;
    private Schema schema;

```
