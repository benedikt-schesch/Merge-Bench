The conflict arises in how to convert `(rawValue)` to a string. The left side uses a helper method `jsonHelper.getStringFrom()`, while the right side uses `rawValue.toString()`.

The intent of the left side is likely to use a helper method for string conversion, possibly to handle nulls or specific formatting. The right side simplifies the conversion using `toString()`, but may not handle edge cases as gracefully.

Given the comment's caution about `toString()`, the safer approach is to use the helper method on the left.

```java
       * This is useful if, for example, you've got a @Facebook-annotated string field that you'd like to have a numeric
       * type shoved into.
       *
       * User beware: this will turn *anything* into a string, which might lead to results you don't expect.
