Both `OutputStream` and `PrintStream` might be necessary for the code's functionality. Since they are related but serve different purposes, it's safer to include both imports to cover all bases.

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.io.SequenceInputStream;
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.SocketException;
import java.net.SocketImplFactory;
```
