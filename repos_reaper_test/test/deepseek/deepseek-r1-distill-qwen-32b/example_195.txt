To resolve the conflict, we'll use the version from the other side of the merge that properly initializes the variables and uses the correct types.

```java
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }
    
    
    public Class getClassForAlias(String alias) throws IOException{
<<<<<<< HEAD
        String className, funcSpec = null;
=======
        String className = null;
        FuncSpec funcSpec = null;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        if (definedFunctions != null) {
            funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias);
        }
        if (funcSpec != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

It appears that both sides are trying to declare two variables (`className` and `funcSpec`) but with slightly different initialization strategies. The main difference is in how `className` is handled:

1. The first version (HEAD) initializes only `funcSpec` to null, leaving `className` uninitialized
2. The second version properly initializes both variables to null

Given the context, the version from the other side of the merge (the second version) is likely the correct one as it properly initializes both variables, making the code safer and more predictable. This is the version that should be used to resolve the conflict.
