The merge conflict involves import statements in the Java code. Both imports are related but serve different purposes. 

The original import `ExecType` is needed to refer to the class, while the static import allows direct access to `MAPREDUCE` without the class name. If the code requires both forms, we'll merge the imports.

Here's the resolved code:

```java

package org.apache.pig.test;

import static org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType.MAPREDUCE;
import org.apache.pig.ExecType;
import org.apache.pig.PigServer;
import org.apache.pig.data.DataType;
import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;
```
