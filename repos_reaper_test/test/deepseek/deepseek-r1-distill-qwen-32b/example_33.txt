/**
 * Component that gives the owner the characteristics to be a part of a Scene. <p> A Scene consists of {@link Transform}s which represent the snapshot state, the live state, and the rendering state.

The `Quaternion` import appears to be necessary for functionality related to 3D rotations and transformations, which would align with the use of `Transform` and `Vector3`. Since it's only present in the HEAD version, I have preserved it as the intended import.
