As a semantic merge conflict resolution expert, I analyzed the intent and found that both sides are declaring a synchronized set with different names (`customDecksIds` vs `cardcastDeckIds`) and different types (`Set<Integer>` vs `Set<String>`). Since the intent of both sets appears to diverge and they serve different purposes, I will keep both in the merged result. However, the name difference and type difference could suggest potential ambiguities in the codebase that would need to be resolved.
