The merge conflict involves two versions of initializing an ArrayList. The left side explicitly specifies the type parameter, while the right side uses the diamond operator for type inference. Both achieve the same result, so choosing the cleaner syntax with the diamond operator is appropriate.

```java
    }
    return info;
  }

  public final List<Player> getPlayers() {
    final List<Player> copy = new ArrayList<>(players.size());
    copy.addAll(players);
    return copy;
  }
