```java

    /**
     * Returns the length of a file in bytes which exists in the HDFS (accounts for replication).
     * @param filename the name of the file
     * @return length of the file in bytes
     * @throws IOException
     */
    public long fileSize(String filename) throws IOException {
        DataStorage dfs = pigContext.getDfs();
        ElementDescriptor elem = dfs.asElement(filename);
``` 

I've merged the intent of both sides by:
1. Keeping the method documentation as it was
2. Including the @param description that was added in one branch
3. Preserving the @return and @throws documentation from the other branch
4. Maintaining the function signature

This combines the best of both changes while maintaining the semantic meaning of the documentation.
