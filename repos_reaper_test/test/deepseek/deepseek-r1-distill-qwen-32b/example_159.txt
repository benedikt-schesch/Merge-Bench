I'll remove the conflict markers and decide to preserve both methods as both seem to serve different purposes. The randomizeFileLocalizer() method is likely used for testing or randomizing file localization, while getMRPlan() is part of the core functionality for retrieving the compiled MapReduce plan.

The final resolved code will include both methods:

```java
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public void randomizeFileLocalizer(){
        FileLocalizer.setR(new Random());
    }

    /**
     * Used to get the compiled plan
     * @return map reduce plan built by the compiler
     */
    public MROperPlan getMRPlan() {
```
