I will return the snippet with the full context, keeping it exactly as is:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Locale;
<<<<<<< HEAD

import com.google.android.gms.games.Games;

import de.j4velin.pedometer.background.SensorListener;
import de.j4velin.pedometer.util.Logger;
import android.app.AlertDialog;
import android.app.Dialog;
import android.content.Context;
```

The conflict appears to be between an import from Google Play Games Services (`com.google.android.gms.games.Games`) and a set of imports related to pedometer functionality and Android UI components.

From a semantic perspective, these imports appear to serve different purposes:
- The Google import is related to game services
- The other imports are related to sensor data collection and UI dialog management

Since these imports appear to be complementary rather than conflicting, the merge conflict could be resolved by keeping both sets of imports. However, since I'm instructed not to make changes unless I'm certain, I'll return the snippet as-is with the conflict markers.
