To resolve the merge conflict, we should retain the `Session session;` field as it is essential for the class's functionality. The conflict arises because one branch removes the field while the other keeps it. Keeping the field ensures that any code referencing it remains functional.

```java
 *
 */
public class SSHSocketImplFactory implements SocketImplFactory, Logger {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImplFactory.class);

    Session session;

    public static SSHSocketImplFactory getFactory() throws JSchException, IOException {
        return getFactory(System.getProperty("ssh.gateway"));
```
