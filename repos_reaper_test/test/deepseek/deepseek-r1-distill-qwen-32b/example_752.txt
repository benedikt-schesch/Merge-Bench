The provided code snippet does not contain a meaningful merge conflict as the same code is present on both sides of the conflict markers. Therefore, the merge can be resolved by simply removing the conflict markers and keeping the line as it is.

Here is the cleaned-up code:

```java
		if(result.isLastEvent()){
			this.concludeMeasurement();		
			return true;
		}
		
		evaluator.addResult(result.getInstance(), result.getClassVotes());
		
		totalCount += 1;
		
		if(totalCount == 1){
			sampleStart = System.nanoTime();
			experimentStart = sampleStart;
```
