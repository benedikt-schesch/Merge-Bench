To resolve this merge conflict, both imports should be preserved because they import different types from the `java.util` package. The `ArrayList` and `Iterator` are both part of the Java Collections Framework but are different interfaces/classes with distinct functionalities.

Here is the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict resolved by including both imports:

```java
import com.restfb.util.DateUtils;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;

import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;
```
