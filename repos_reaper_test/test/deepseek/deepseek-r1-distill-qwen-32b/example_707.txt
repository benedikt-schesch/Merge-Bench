The conflict appears to be between an empty method implementation and a new implementation that adds the playlist retrieval functionality. Since the new implementation (`=======
...`) provides a complete solution, I will adopt that as it seems to be the intended change.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
		}
	}

	@Override
	public PlaylistRemote[] getUserPlaylist(String user) throws JSONException, WSError {
		try {
			user = URLEncoder.encode(user, "UTF-8");
			String jsonString = doGet("id+name+url+duration/playlist/json/playlist_user/?order=starred_desc&user_idstr="+user);
			return PlaylistFunctions.getPlaylists(new JSONArray(jsonString));
		} catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
```
