The conflict arises from differing return type expectations based on HBase versions. The correct approach is to return a type that accommodates both scenarios, so changing to `Deferred<Object>` is appropriate.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
   * Package-private access point for {@link Scanner}s to open themselves.
   * @param scanner The scanner to open.
   * @return A deferred scanner ID (long) if HBase 0.94 and before, or a
   * deferred {@link Scanner.Response} if HBase 0.95 and up.
   */
  Deferred<Object> openScanner(final Scanner scanner) {
    num_scanners_opened.increment();
    return sendRpcToRegion(scanner.getOpenRequest()).addCallbacks(
      scanner_opened,
      new Callback<Object, Object>() {
        public Object call(final Object error) {
```
