The conflict revolves around the intent of the test method. The original method named `shouldRespondToPostChangeEvents()` suggests testing if the processor responds to post-change events. However, the other side renames it to `shouldNotRespondToPostChangeEvents()` with a comment indicating that responding to post-change events isn't desired, preferring post-build events instead.

The test logic inside checks if the processor can process a POST_CHANGE event and expects it to return false, then verifies no interactions with the workspace. This aligns with the renamed method's intent of not responding to post-change events.

```java

		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

	@Test
<<<<<<< HEAD
	void shouldRespondToPostChangeEvents() {
=======
	public void shouldNotRespondToPostChangeEvents() {
		// Not sure why we wanted to respond to change events, seems better to respond to the post build event, once the build is finished
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, POST_CHANGE, AUTO_BUILD, null);
		assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event));

		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}
```
