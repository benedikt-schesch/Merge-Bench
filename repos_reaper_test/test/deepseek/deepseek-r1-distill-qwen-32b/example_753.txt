I need to resolve the conflict between the two versions of the learnerP field declaration.

Upon examining the context, it appears both sides are declaring a private field named learnerP, but with different class types: LocalClassifierProcessor vs LocalLearnerProcessor.

The intent is to determine which class is appropriate for the learnerP field in the SingleClassifier class.

Given that SingleClassifier implements Learner and AdaptiveLearner interfaces, it makes more sense to use LocalLearnerProcessor as it aligns with the learning functionality.

Therefore, I will choose the version from the 40d31d6 commit that uses LocalLearnerProcessor.
