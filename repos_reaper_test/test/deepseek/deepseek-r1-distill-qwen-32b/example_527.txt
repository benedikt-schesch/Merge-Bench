To resolve this conflict, we need to identify which side correctly parses the message payload. The original code in HEAD had a comment about an incrementing number at offset+1, which isn't used. The other side removed this comment and parsed sceneId and time from offset+3 and offset+2. Assuming the latter correctly reflects the payload structure, we adopt those changes.

```java
    public void handleApplicationCommandRequest(SerialMessage serialMessage, int offset, int endpoint) {
        logger.debug("NODE {}: Received central scene command (v{})", this.getNode().getNodeId(), this.getVersion());
        int command = serialMessage.getMessagePayloadByte(offset);
        switch (command) {
            case SCENE_SET:
                int sceneId = serialMessage.getMessagePayloadByte(offset + 3);
                int time = serialMessage.getMessagePayloadByte(offset + 2);
                if (time > 127) {
                    // Values of 128 and above are in minutes (128 = 1 minute)
                    time = (time - 127) * 60;
```
