The conflict involves a test method comparing FanCount and LikesCount/Likes. Both branches assert the same value (3L) but use different field accessors. One side uses `getLikesCount()` while the other uses `getLikes()`. 

The intent seems to verify the correct count value, but the field names suggest a structural change in how likes are represented - possibly moving from a direct count field to a nested object.

Given that both assertions check the same semantic value (the count of likes fans), and considering that the field name changed from `likes_count` to `likes`, the appropriate resolution would be to use the more precise accessor method based on the object structure.

```java
  @Test
  public void checkV2_5_fanCount() {
    Page page = createJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonFromClasspath("v2_5/page-with-likes"), Page.class);
    assertNotNull(page);
    assertEquals(3L, page.getFanCount().longValue());
    assertEquals(3L, page.getLikes().longValue());
  }

  @Test
  public void checkV2_6_adminNotes() {
    Page page = createJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonFromClasspath("v2_6/page-with-admin_notes"), Page.class);
```

The conflict is resolved by using the more precise accessor `getLikes()`, consistent with how the data structure is likely modeled.
