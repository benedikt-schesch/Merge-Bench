        this(k, -1, null);
    }

```

I don't see a way to merge these changes semantically as they are adding different fields to the class. The two sides are adding different instance variables: one is adding a boolean array `readOnce` while the other is adding a `PigNullableWritable keyWritable`. These are separate concepts and would need to coexist in the final merged code. To resolve this, I would keep both additions as they serve different purposes. The final code should include both instance variables:

```java
    private boolean useDefaultBag = false;

    protected Packager pkgr;

    private boolean[] readOnce;
    private PigNullableWritable keyWritable;

    public POPackage(OperatorKey k) {
        this(k, -1, null);
    }
```
