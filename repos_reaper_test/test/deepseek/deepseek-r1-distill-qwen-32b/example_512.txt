To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the differences and determine the correct approach:

1. The main difference is between `BitmapTexture` and `BitmapTextureAtlas`.

2. Looking at the AndEngine documentation, `BitmapTexture` is used for raw texture data while `BitmapTextureAtlas` is a helper class for managing multiple textures.

3. Since we're working with a single font texture, `BitmapTexture` is the appropriate choice here.

4. Additionally, calling `loadTexture()` after creating the font is unnecessary since it's already loaded during font creation.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
	}

	@Override
	public void onLoadResources() {
		/* Load Font/Textures. */
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTexture(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);

		FontFactory.setAssetBasePath("font/");
		this.mFont = FontFactory.createFromAsset(this.mFontTexture, this, "Plok.ttf", 48, true, Color.WHITE);
		this.mEngine.getFontManager().loadFont(this.mFont);
	}
```

This solution:
- Uses `BitmapTexture` for proper texture loading
- Removes redundant texture loading call
- Maintains proper resource management
