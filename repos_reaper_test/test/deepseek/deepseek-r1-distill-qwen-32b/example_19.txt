I will return the exact code snippet with the merge conflict as provided, since the intent behind the changes is unclear and the conflict involves method signatures that are semantically different between the two branches (abstract method declaration vs concrete implementation with parameters). Manually resolving this conflict would require knowledge of the system's API design intentions and how the start method is used across the codebase.

```java
	@Override
	public String getAPIVersion() {
		return SpoutEngine.class.getPackage().getImplementationVersion();
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	public void start() {
=======
	public abstract void start();

	public void start(boolean checkWorlds) {
