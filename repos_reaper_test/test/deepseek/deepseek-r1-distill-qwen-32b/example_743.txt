To resolve this merge conflict, we should recognize that both sides have the same functionality but differ in formatting. 

On one side, the code is written as a single line:

```java
                if (isFirst && widget.getY() + widget.getHeight() < tested.getFinalY() - tested.getHeight() / 2)
```

On the other side, it's split across multiple lines for better readability:

```java
                if (isFirst && widget.getY() + widget.getHeight() < tested.getFinalY()
                        - tested.getHeight() / 2)
```

Both versions perform the exact same check but differ in code style. Since they are functionally equivalent, the choice between them depends on coding style preferences.

However, the second version with line wrapping is generally more readable, especially when lines are longer. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by keeping the version that wraps the condition for better readability.

Here is the resolved version:

```java
                continue;
            }

            if (widget.getY() < tested.getFinalY() + tested.getMeasuredHeight()) {
                // Don't try to go before the first if we're already it
                if (isFirst && widget.getY() + widget.getHeight() < tested.getFinalY()
                        - tested.getHeight() / 2)
                    break;

                // Move the widget in our list
                mOpenWidgets.remove(widget);
                mOpenWidgets.add(i, widget);
```

The intent of both sides was the same, and we've resolved the conflict by choosing the version that improves readability.
