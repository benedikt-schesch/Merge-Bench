The merge conflict is due to differences in code formatting (line breaks and braces), but the semantic intent is the same. Here's the resolved code with consistent formatting:

```java
  protected LongAssert(Long actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, LongAssert.class, description);
  }

  public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected) {
    longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
```
