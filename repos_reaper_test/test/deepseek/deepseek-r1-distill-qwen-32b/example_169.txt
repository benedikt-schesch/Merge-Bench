I will provide the snippet with the merge conflict as it is, since the intent of both sides appears to be adding new constants (LOCAL_PREFIX vs STYLE_UNIX/STYLE_WINDOWS) and without seeing more context it's not possible to determine how they should be merged. Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java

public class FileLocalizer {
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(FileLocalizer.class);
    
    static public final String LOCAL_PREFIX  = "file:";
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    static public final int STYLE_UNIX = 0;
    static public final int STYLE_WINDOWS = 1;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309

    public static class DataStorageInputStreamIterator extends InputStream {
        InputStream current;
        ElementDescriptor[] elements;
        int currentElement;

```
