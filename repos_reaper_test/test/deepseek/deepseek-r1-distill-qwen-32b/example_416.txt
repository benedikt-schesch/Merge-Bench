The merge conflict involves import statements. The intent of both sides seems to be to include necessary imports for the code to compile. However, without knowing the full context of the codebase and what classes are actually used, it's unclear whether all the imports are needed or if some can be safely removed. Therefore, it's safer to keep both sets of imports to ensure that all necessary classes are properly imported.
