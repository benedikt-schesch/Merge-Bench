The merge conflict is resolved by including the necessary check to prevent overwriting an existing ScriptState.

```java

        addJarsFromProperties();
        markPredeployedJarsFromProperties();

        PigStats.start(pigContext.getExecutionEngine().instantiatePigStats());
        // ScriptState may have been initialized in Main. In that case, we
        // should not overwrite it.
        if (ScriptState.get() == null) {
            // If Pig was started via command line, ScriptState should have been
            // already initialized in Main. If so, we should not overwrite it.
            ScriptState.start(pigContext.getExecutionEngine().instantiateScriptState());
        }
```
