The code snippet shows a merge conflict around how the line setting `pkgr.setKeyType()` is formatted. One version keeps it as a single line while the other splits it for better readability. Both versions have the same semantic meaning, but splitting it into two lines improves readability.

Here's the resolution using the more readable multi-line format:

```java
        }

        POPackage pkg = new POPackage(new OperatorKey(scope,
                nig.getNextNodeId(scope)));
        LitePackager pkgr = new LitePackager();
        pkgr.setKeyType((fields == null || fields.length > 1) ? DataType.TUPLE
                : keyType);
        pkg.setPkgr(pkgr);
        pkg.setNumInps(1);
        mro.reducePlan.add(pkg);

        PhysicalPlan ep = new PhysicalPlan();
```
