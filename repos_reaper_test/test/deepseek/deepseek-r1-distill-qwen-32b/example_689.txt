The merge conflict involves conflicting values for the node count and relationship count variables in a test method. Both sides are updating these counts, and their intent might be to reflect different states or expected results in the test. Without additional context, I cannot determine which set of values is correct. I'll return the conflict as it is.

```java
	@Test
	public void testRebuildCommand() {

		final Console console = new Console(securityContext, ConsoleMode.JavaScript, Collections.emptyMap());

<<<<<<< HEAD
		final int nodeCount           = 1834;
		final int relCount            = 2840;
