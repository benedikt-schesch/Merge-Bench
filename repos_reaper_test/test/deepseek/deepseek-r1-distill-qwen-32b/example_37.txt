The merge conflict is between two import statements related to building command-line interfaces. The test class `HelpTest` is likely testing the help functionality of a command-line interface. The intent is to build and test the CLI, so the correct import is `Cli.buildCli`.

The resolution is to keep the import from `Cli.buildCli` and remove the alternative import.

```java
import io.airlift.command.command.CommandRemove;

import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

import static io.airlift.command.Cli.buildCli;

@Test
public class HelpTest
{
```
