The code snippet has a merge conflict, but upon examining both sides, the content is identical. Therefore, there is no actual conflict to resolve.

```java
        // For each indexed tup in the inp, split them up and place their
        // fields into the proper bags.  If the given field isn't a bag, just
        // set the value as is.
        for (Tuple tup : bags[0]) {
            int tupIndex = 0; // an index for accessing elements from
            // the value (tup) that we have currently
            for(int i = 0; i < mBags.length; i++) {
                Integer keyIndex = keyLookup.get(i);
                if(keyIndex == null && mBags[i]) {
                    // the field for this index is not the
                    // key - so just take it from the "value"
```
