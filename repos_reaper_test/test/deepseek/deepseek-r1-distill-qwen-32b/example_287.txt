            inputAttached = true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "Error attaching input for key " + k +
                    " in " + name() + " at location " + getOriginalLocations(), e);
```

The conflict appears to involve adding the assignment `keyWritable = k` from the 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a commit while preserving the original line `key = pkgr.getKey(k)`. 

The change from the other commit (88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a) adds the assignment of `keyWritable = k` which suggests the intent to track the original writable key in addition to the processed key from `pkgr.getKey(k)`. The original code sets `key` to a processed value, while the new code adds tracking of the raw `PigNullableWritable` in `keyWritable`.

I will resolve this by keeping both assignments to satisfy both intents:

```java
     */
    public void attachInput(PigNullableWritable k, Iterator<NullableTuple> inp) {
        try {
            tupIter = inp;
            key = pkgr.getKey(k);
            keyWritable = k;
            inputAttached = true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "Error attaching input for key " + k +
                    " in " + name() + " at location " + getOriginalLocations(), e);
```

The merge resolution preserves both the original processing of `pkgr.getKey(k)` into `key` and adds the new `keyWritable` assignment to track the raw input writable.
