To resolve the conflict, we'll choose the assertion style from the HEAD side:

```java
@Test
public void checkContentTypeBytes_html() {
  String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
  BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.html", attachmentData.getBytes());
  assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html");
}

@Test
public void checkContentTypeBytes_fallback() {
  String attachmentData = "this is a short string";

  // ... rest of the code
}
```

Both changes aim to verify the content type, so selecting either approach maintains the test's purpose.
