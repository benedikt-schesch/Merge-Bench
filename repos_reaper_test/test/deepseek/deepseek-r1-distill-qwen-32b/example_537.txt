This merge conflict appears to be a formatting change rather than a functional change. The only difference is the spacing after the `else` keyword. Both implementations have the same semantic meaning.

Since this is just a formatting change, I'll resolve it by keeping the version with consistent spacing that follows standard Java coding conventions.

```java
        public void run() {
          writeQAction(args, callbackContext);
        }
      });
      return true;
    } else if (readDescriptorActionName.equals(action)) {
      cordova.getThreadPool().execute(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
          readDescriptorAction(args, callbackContext);
        }
      });
```
