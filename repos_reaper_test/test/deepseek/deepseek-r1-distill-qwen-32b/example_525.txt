[WARNING] The merge conflict appears to have overlapping conditions that could be simplified. Both sides are checking for the same condition but with different messages. The intent seems to be about skipping adding the URL if it's too long. However, the semantics of the measurements (bytes vs characters) might differ if maxUriLength was meant for bytes but uriString.length() is characters. Since this is unclear, I'll leave it unresolved to clarify the intent.

```java
                        
                        if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength) {
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                            }

                            builder.append(url);
                        } else if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength){
                            if (verbose) {
                                System.err.println("[INFO] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI longer than " + maxUriLength + " characters. Skipping.");
                            }
