The conflict is between a class that accepts constructor parameters or not.

The correct resolution would create the request with the url parameter as the HttpMethod.PATCH suggests that the URL is important for the request. The original implementation passes no parameters but the new commit passes the URL.

```java
  public EnumSet<HttpMethod> supportedOptionalMethods =
      EnumSet.of(HttpMethod.HEAD, HttpMethod.PATCH);

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildDeleteRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildGetRequest(String url) throws IOException {
```
