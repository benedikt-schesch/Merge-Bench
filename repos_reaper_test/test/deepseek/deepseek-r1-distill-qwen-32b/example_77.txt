The code contains a merge conflict in the import statements related to logging. The HEAD side is importing Logger from `org.apache.logging.log4j` while the other side is importing from `org.apache.log4j`. These are two different versions of the Log4j logging framework, with `org.apache.logging.log4j` typically being used for Log4j 2.x and `org.apache.log4j` being used for Log4j 1.x.

To resolve this conflict, we would need additional context to determine which version of Log4j the codebase is using and whether the intended import is for Log4j 1.x or Log4j 2.x. This includes looking at:
1. How the Logger is being used elsewhere in the code
2. Whether LogManager.getLogger() (Log4j 2.x) is being used
3. Whether Logger.getLogger() (Log4j 1.x) is being used

Without seeing how the logger is being used in the rest of the codebase, it's unclear which import is semantically correct. Therefore, this conflict should be resolved by choosing one version of Log4j to use consistently throughout the codebase and removing the conflicting imports.

The conflict remains unresolved as the intent is ambiguous based on the provided code snippet alone.
