The merge conflict involves two ways to initialize a list. The correct resolution is to use the diamond operator for clarity and conciseness.

```java
    } else {
      // getPlayerForUser synchronizes on players. This has caused a deadlock in the past.
      // Good idea to not nest synchronizes if possible anyway.
      final Player player = getPlayerForUser(user);
      synchronized (playedCards) {
        final List<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>> cardData = new ArrayList<>(playedCards.size());
        int faceDownCards = playedCards.size();
        if (playedCards.hasPlayer(player)) {
          cardData.add(getWhiteCardData(playedCards.getCards(player)));
          faceDownCards--;
        }
```
