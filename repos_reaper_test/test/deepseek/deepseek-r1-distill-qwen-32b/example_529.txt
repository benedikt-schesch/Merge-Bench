To resolve the merge conflict, the correct approach is to use the loop condition from the left side, which uses `null` instead of the invalid `nil`. The variable name change from `comp` to `res` doesn't affect functionality, but since `comp` is used on the left, it's consistent to keep it. Thus, the resolved code uses the left side's loop condition and variable name.

```java
		return z;
	}

	protected T findEQ(T x) {
		Node u = r;
		while (u != null) {
			int comp = c.compare(x, u.x);
			if (comp < 0) 
				u = u.left;
			else if (comp > 0)
				u = u.right;
			else
				return u.x;
```
