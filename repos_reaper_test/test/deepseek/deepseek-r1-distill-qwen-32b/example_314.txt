To resolve the merge conflict, we need to decide which TextView declaration to keep based on the intended functionality.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identify the conflicting lines:**
   - HEAD branch has `public TextView followBtn;`
   - Branch 66827e9 has `public TextView testBtn;`

2. **Determine the intended purpose:**
   - 'followBtn' suggests a button for following.
   - 'testBtn' could be a test version or a different function.

3. **Resolve based on intent:**
   - If 'testBtn' is a temporary addition or intended to replace 'followBtn', it should take precedence.

**Final resolved code:**

```java
	private static class ViewHolder {
		public ImageView profileImage;
		public TextView screenName;
		public TextView userId;
		public TextView lastStatus;
		public TextView testBtn;
	}

	@Override
	public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
		View view;
```
