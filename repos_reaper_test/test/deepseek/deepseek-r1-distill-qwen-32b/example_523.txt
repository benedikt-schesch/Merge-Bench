The merge conflict involves adding a new variable declaration in one branch that's absent in another. The correct resolution is to include the new variable as it's a new feature without impacting existing code.

```java
    private String code = null;
    private int options = 1;
    private String mhtmlRoot = "";
    private String outputFilename = "";
    private int maxUriLength = DEFAULT_MAX_URI_LENGTH;  //IE8 only allows dataURIs up to 32KB
    private int maxImageSize;
    
    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------
