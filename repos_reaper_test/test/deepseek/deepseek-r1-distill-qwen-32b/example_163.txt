To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine which import statement aligns with the intended functionality of the code. 

- If the code relies on `BufferedReader` for reading text efficiently, we should choose `BufferedReader`.
- If it relies on `BufferedInputStream` for buffering input streams, we should choose that.

Given the ambiguity without additional context, both possibilities are presented. Therefore, the conflict remains unresolved.
