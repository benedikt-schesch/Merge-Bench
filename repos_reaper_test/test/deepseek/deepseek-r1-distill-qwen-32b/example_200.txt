The conflict appears to be between an empty section in HEAD and a section in another commit adding two new fields. Since both additions are new lines added in one commit and empty space in another, there's no conflicting intention. We'll keep both additions.

```java
    /**
     * a table mapping names to streaming commands.
     */
    private Map<String, StreamingCommand> definedCommands = 
        new HashMap<String, StreamingCommand>();
    
    private static ArrayList<String> packageImportList = new ArrayList<String>();

    public boolean debug = true;
    
    // List of paths skipped for automatic shipping
```
