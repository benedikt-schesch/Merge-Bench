To resolve the merge conflict, we need to include the `serialVersionUID` from the HEAD branch while preserving the other changes from the a17acec branch. Here's the resolved code:

```java

  }

  public static class MailingAddress extends AbstractFacebookType {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * The mailing address ID.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
```
