To resolve the conflict, both versions correct, but the right side (5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a) optimizes array creation. The improved code uses `new Player[0]` which is more efficient as it avoids potential array resizing. Both correctly initialize the `users` list with the array length.

```java
  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
   */
  private List<User> playersToUsers() {
    final List<User> users;
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    users = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      users.add(player.getUser());
    }
    synchronized (spectators) {
      users.addAll(spectators);
    }
    return users;
  }
```

Answer: The conflicts were resolved by selecting the right side's more efficient array initialization, which avoids unnecessary array allocation while maintaining the correct list capacity.

```java
  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
   */
  private List<User> playersToUsers() {
    final List<User> users;
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    users = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      users.add(player.getUser());
    }
    synchronized (spectators) {
      users.addAll(spectators);
    }
    return users;
  }
```
