The merge conflict involves a method name change and return type change. One branch renames the method to use "CustomDeck" with Integer return type, while the other branch renames it to "CardcastDeck" with String return type. Since these methods provide different functionality (one for integer deck IDs and another for string deck IDs), both methods would need to coexist or one would need to be renamed to avoid ambiguity. Based on the context of the class and the database definition, the name `getCardcastDeckIds()` with `String` return type is likely the correct one.

```java
  public void updateGameSettings(final GameOptions newOptions) {
    this.options.update(newOptions);
    notifyGameOptionsChanged();
  }

  public Set<String> getCardcastDeckIds() {
    return cardcastDeckIds;
  }
