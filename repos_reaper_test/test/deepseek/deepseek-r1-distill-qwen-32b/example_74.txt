To resolve the merge conflict, we'll examine the context and intent of each change:

1. **Left Side (HEAD)**: Uses `Provider<CustomCardsService>`
2. **Right Side**: Uses `Provider<CardcastService>` with commit message hinting at "cardcast"

Since the intent to use `CardcastService` seems more recent and specific, it likely supersedes the older `CustomCardsService`.

The resolved code will use `Provider<CardcastService>`:

```java
  /**
   * Lock to prevent missing timer updates.
   */
  private final Object roundTimerLock = new Object();
  private final ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor globalTimer;
  private final Provider<CardcastService> cardcastServiceProvider;
  private final Provider<String> uniqueIdProvider;
  private Player host;
  private BlackDeck blackDeck;
  private BlackCard blackCard;
  private WhiteDeck whiteDeck;
```
