```java
        //do nothing
    }

    public void visitMapLookUp(POMapLookUp mapLookUp) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub

    }

    public void visitCast(POCast cast) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    }
```

The conflict appears to be non-substantive as both sides seem to contain the same empty method implementation. There is no clear semantic intent difference to resolve, so I will return the snippet as-is.
