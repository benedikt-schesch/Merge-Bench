The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two different event classes (`PositionSendEvent` and `BlockUpdateEvent`) that were incorrectly merged into a single file. The imports and class structures are incompatible because they serve different purposes. The left side imports geometric and imaginary math classes, while the right side imports chunk-related classes. 

This appears to be an accidental merge conflict where two different files were mistakenly combined. Since the files are meant to be separate and serve different purposes (one for position/rotation data and the other for chunk updates), the correct resolution is to split them back into their respective files rather than trying to reconcile them in a single class.

Therefore, I will return the original conflicted snippet as it should not be merged into a single file.
