To resolve this merge conflict, we need to analyze the intent behind the two versions. In both cases, the code is defining a class `POPackageTupleBuffer` that implements the `AccumulativeTupleBuffer` interface. The difference is in the access level - one version defines it as `public` while the other does not specify access level (default package-private access).

Given the context of the code, we should ensure proper encapsulation and scoping for the class. If the class needs to be accessible outside its package, `public` is needed. If it's meant to stay internal to the package, package-private (no access specifier) is sufficient.

However, without more context, it's safer to preserve the original access level. Here are the options:

```java
public class POPackageTupleBuffer implements AccumulativeTupleBuffer {
```

OR

```java
class POPackageTupleBuffer implements AccumulativeTupleBuffer {
```

基于常见做法，如果这个类是作为内部类，则第2个版本可能更好。但如果需要外部可见性，建议使用第1个版本。

建议请根据项目上下文选择合适的版本。
