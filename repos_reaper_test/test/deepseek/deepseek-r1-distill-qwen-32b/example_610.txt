To resolve the merge conflict, we'll include both changes. The left side initializes the `serialVersionUID`, which is necessary for serialization. The right side adds the `year` field with its annotations, enhancing the class's functionality. Combining both ensures that both functionalities are preserved.

```java
    private PageStartDate date;
  }

  public static class PageStartDate extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private Integer year;

  }
```
