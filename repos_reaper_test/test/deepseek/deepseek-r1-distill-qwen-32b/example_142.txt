To resolve this merge conflict, we need to reconcile the differences between the two versions while preserving the intended functionality.

1. **Parameter Type Consideration**: The HEAD branch uses `MiniGenericCluster`, which might be necessary for accepting a broader range of cluster types. This suggests it's a generic method that shouldn't be restricted to a specific cluster implementation.

2. **OS Compatibility Handling**: The other branch includes code to handle Windows-specific path separators. This is essential for ensuring the method works correctly across different operating systems.

**Solution**: Retain the `MiniGenericCluster` parameter from the HEAD branch to maintain flexibility and incorporate the Windows path handling to ensure compatibility.

```java
            throw new IOException(e);
        }

    }
