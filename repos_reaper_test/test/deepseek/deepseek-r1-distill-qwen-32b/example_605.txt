To resolve the conflict, we'll adopt the right side's changes because it correctly maps the field to the Facebook API and uses a more descriptive name.

```java
   * @RestFB.GraphApi.Since 2.6
   * @return The Pages that this Page Likes.
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  @Facebook("likes")
  private Likes likesList;

  /**
   * The number of likes the page has.
   *
   * @return The number of likes the page has
```
