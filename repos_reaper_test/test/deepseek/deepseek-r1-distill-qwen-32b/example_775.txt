To resolve the merge conflict, we need to integrate the changes from both branches while preserving the necessary imports and class structure. Here is the conflict-free code:

```java
import org.hbase.async.KeyValue;
import org.hbase.async.PutRequest;
import org.hbase.async.RowLock;
import org.hbase.async.RowLockRequest;
import org.hbase.async.Scanner;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.hbase.async.test.Common;

/**
```

This resolution combines the imports from both branches and ensures the class comment follows immediately afterward.
