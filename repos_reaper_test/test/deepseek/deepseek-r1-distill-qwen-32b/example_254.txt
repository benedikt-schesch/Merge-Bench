The merge conflict involves adding a new method `visitPOForEach` to an existing class that implements a visitor pattern. Both sides of the merge agree on the original `visitPackage` method, but only one side adds the new `visitPOForEach` method. The correct resolution is to include both methods as they serve different purposes.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
    }

    public void visitPackage(POPackage pkg) throws VisitorException {
        //do nothing
    }

    public void visitPOForEach(POForEach nfe) throws VisitorException {
        List<PhysicalPlan> inpPlans = nfe.getInputPlans();
        for (PhysicalPlan plan : inpPlans) {
            pushWalker(mCurrentWalker.spawnChildWalker(plan));
            visit();
        }
    }
```
