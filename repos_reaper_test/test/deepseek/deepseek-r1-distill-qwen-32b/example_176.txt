The conflict is in the import statements for PigMapReduce. The original HEAD branch imports from `mapreduceExec`, while the other branch imports from `mapReduceLayer` and comments out the old import.

The intent seems to be refactoring the import location for PigMapReduce. Given that both paths are attempting to import the same class from different packages, and based on the import hygiene in software development, we should preserve only the correct import location.

Assuming the `mapReduceLayer` is the correct and newer location for the PigMapReduce class, I will resolve the conflict by keeping that import and removing the commented-out one.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
import java.util.jar.JarEntry;
import java.util.jar.JarInputStream;
import java.util.jar.JarOutputStream;
import java.util.zip.ZipEntry;

import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.PigMapReduce;
import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;

public class JarManager {
