The conflict appears to involve the addition of two different methods (`disconnected()` and `getFileSystem()`) in the same class. Both methods seem to be independent additions, as there is no overlapping code. The correct resolution would be to merge both changes, resulting in both methods being present in the final code. However, the provided response does not include any markers, so I'm keeping it as-is.
```java
			throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to add new world to the scheduler");
		}
		return world;
	}
