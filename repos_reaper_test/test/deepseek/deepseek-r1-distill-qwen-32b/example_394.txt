The merge conflict revolves around two changes:

1. The test method `shouldUpdateCoreOnAutoBuild()` in the HEAD branch is missing the `public` access modifier, while the merged branch adds it. Since JUnit test methods should be public to be executable, we should include the public modifier.

2. The method name has a typo ("preparateCore") which is fixed in the merged branch to "prepareCore". Fixing the typo is essential for the test to run without errors.

Here is the merged code incorporating both fixes:

```java
assertEquals(1, updates);
verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));
}

@Test
public void shouldUpdateCoreOnAutoBuild() throws CoreException {
    InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 10);
    
    workspace.updateProjects(Collections.singleton(resource));

    assertStatusIs(findingTests(0, projects.size(), 0));
    verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));
}
```
