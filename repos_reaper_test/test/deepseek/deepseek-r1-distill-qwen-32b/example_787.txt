To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine which version of the super constructor call is correct. The left side includes 'PUT' while the right side does not. Given that 'PUT' is likely a necessary parameter for the superclass constructor, we should retain it to ensure the code functions correctly.

Here is the resolved code:

```java

  /** Private constructor.  */
  private PutRequest(final byte[] table,
                     final KeyValue kv,
                     final long lockid) {
    super(PUT, table, kv.key(), kv.family(), kv.timestamp(), lockid);
    this.qualifiers = new byte[][] { kv.qualifier() };
    this.values = new byte[][] { kv.value() };
  }

  /** Private constructor.  */

```

The conflict is resolved by keeping the version from HEAD that includes the 'PUT' parameter in the super constructor call.
