```java
        public int compare(JobStats o1, JobStats o2) {
            return o1.getJobId().compareTo(o2.getJobId());
        }
    }

    public void setBackendException(String jobId, Exception e) {
        if (e instanceof PigException) {
            LOG.error("ERROR " + ((PigException)e).getErrorCode() + ": "
                    + e.getLocalizedMessage());
        } else if (e != null) {
```

In this case, the intent of the conflict is to add the `@Private` annotation to the `setBackendException` method. The `@Private` annotation is likely a custom annotation used for access control or logging purposes. 

The correct resolution is to merge the `@Private` annotation from one side with the method definition from the other side. The final resolved code should include both the annotation and the method definition for proper encapsulation and logging of exceptions.
