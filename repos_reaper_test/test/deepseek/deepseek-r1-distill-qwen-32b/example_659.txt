To resolve the merge conflict, we need to consider the intent of both changes:

1. The local change (HEAD) adds a `protected AndroidBuildService buildService` field
2. The remote change adds a `private IProjectConfigurationManager projectConfigurationManager` field

These are two distinct fields with different purposes and do not conflict with each other. The best resolution is to include both fields to preserve the functionality from both branches.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
	@Inject
	private BuildListenerRegistry registry;

	protected AndroidBuildService buildService;
	private IProjectConfigurationManager projectConfigurationManager;

	@Override
	@SuppressWarnings("restriction")
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
	    super.setUp();
```
