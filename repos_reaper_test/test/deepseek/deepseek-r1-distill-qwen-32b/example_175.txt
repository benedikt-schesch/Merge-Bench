The conflict arises due to differing indentation levels within the try block. Both versions contain the same code but with varying spaces. The correct approach is to ensure consistent indentation. Given that the catch block and surrounding code are indented once, we'll adopt that indentation for the try block.

```java
        parser.parseContOnError();
    }

    public void exec() throws Throwable {
        try {
        parser.setInteractive(false);
        parser.parseStopOnError();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Exception pe = Utils.getPermissionException(e);
            if (pe != null)
                log.error("You don't have permission to perform the operation. Error from the server: " + pe.getMessage());
