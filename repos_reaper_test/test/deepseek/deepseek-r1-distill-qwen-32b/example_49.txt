To resolve this conflict, I'll analyze both sides:

<<<<<<< HEAD
This side:
- Uses players.toArray(new Player[players.size()])
- Explicitly types the ArrayList with Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object>

=======
This side:
- Uses players.toArray(new Player[0]), which is a common idiom to let toArray determine the correct array size
- Uses diamond operator for ArrayList and doesn't specify generic types explicitly

Both approaches accomplish the same goal of converting the players collection to an array and creating a list with appropriate capacity. The difference is in style and explicitness.

Since both sides are trying to achieve the same outcome but with slightly different approaches, I'll keep the more modern Java style using the concise diamond operator.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
   *
   * @return Player information for every player in this game: Name, score, status.
   */
  public List<Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object>> getAllPlayerInfo() {
    final List<Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object>> info;
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    info = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      final Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object> playerInfo = getPlayerInfo(player);
      info.add(playerInfo);
    }
    return info;
  }
```
