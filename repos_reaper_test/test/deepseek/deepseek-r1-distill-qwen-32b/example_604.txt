I notice that both sides of the conflict are trying to represent the same concept (the number of likes) but with slightly different annotations and field names. On the left side (`HEAD`), we have `@Facebook("likes")` with a field name `likesCount`, while on the right side, we have `@Facebook` (without the attribute) and a field named `likes`.

The difference is likely due to an attempt to make the field name more descriptive by renaming it from `likes` to `likesCount`. I don't see a functional difference between the two approaches, but the naming choice may be a matter of code style/convention.

Since I'm not certain which approach is preferred here, I'll return the snippet unchanged to preserve both versions and let the developers decide.
