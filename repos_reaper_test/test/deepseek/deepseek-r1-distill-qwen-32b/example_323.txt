To resolve this conflict, we'll fix the drawable resource and process the tweet text properly. Here's the merge result:

```java
		}

		PendingIntent intent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0,
				MentionActivity.createIntent(this), 0);

		notify(intent, MENTION_NOTIFICATION_ID, R.drawable.notify_mention,
				Utils.getSimpleTweetText(latestTweet.text), title, text);

	}

	private static int TWEET_NOTIFICATION_ID = 0;
	private static int DM_NOTIFICATION_ID = 1;
	private static int MENTION_NOTIFICATION_ID = 2;
```

I resolved this conflict by:
1. Using the more accurately named `notify_mention` drawable instead of `notify_mentions`
2. Using the processed tweet text with `Utils.getSimpleTweetText()` for better display in notifications

The change from `notify_mentions` to `notify_mention` provides a more accurate resource name since we're showing a single mention notification at a time. Using `Utils.getSimpleTweetText()` ensures we show a clean version of the tweet text in the notification rather than the raw tweet text.
