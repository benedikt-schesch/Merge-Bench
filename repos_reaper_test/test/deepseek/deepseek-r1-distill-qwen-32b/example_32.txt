To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine the correct imports based on the package structure and dependencies. The class is in the org.spout.api.util.cuboid package, so it should import from the api packages. The right side correctly imports Vector3 from org.spout.api.math and adds Chunk from org.spout.api.geo.cuboid, which seems necessary if the class uses it. Therefore, we'll keep both imports from the right side.

```java
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
```
