The conflict arises because both sides are trying to ensure safe parsing of the "data" field from `rawLabels`. The HEAD version checks if `rawLabels` is an object before accessing it, making it safer. The alternative version directly accesses the field, which could cause errors if `rawLabels` isn't an object. Hence, the HEAD version is chosen for safety.

Resolved code:

```java
    return labels.remove(label);
  }

  @JsonMappingCompleted
  protected void convertLabels(JsonMapper jsonMapper) {
    if (rawLabels != null && rawLabels.isObject()) {
      String innerLabelsString = rawLabels.get("data").toString();
      labels = jsonMapper.toJavaList(innerLabelsString, PageLabel.class);
    }
  }
```
