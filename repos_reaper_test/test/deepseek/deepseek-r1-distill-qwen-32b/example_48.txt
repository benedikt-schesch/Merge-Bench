```java
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      playerNames.add(player.getUser().getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.PLAYERS, playerNames);

    final User[] spectatorsCopy = spectators.toArray(new User[0]);
    final List<String> spectatorNames = new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length);
    for (final User spectator : spectatorsCopy) {
      spectatorNames.add(spectator.getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.SPECTATORS, spectatorNames);
```

The changes made are:
1. Changed `spectators.toArray(new User[spectators.size()])` to `spectators.toArray(new User[0])` as this is a safer way to convert a collection to an array
2. Changed `new ArrayList<String>(spectatorsCopy.length)` to the diamond operator shorthand `new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length)`  

Both changes are semantic improvements and don't conflict with each other, so I've integrated them together.
