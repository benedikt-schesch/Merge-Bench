The merge conflict is between two versions of the `retryGetRootRegionLater` method. The `HEAD` version includes a `DataCallback cb` parameter that isn't used in the method body, while the `d54360905` branch removes this parameter. Since the parameter isn't used, it's safe to adopt the branch version for simplicity.

```java
        zk = null;
      }
    }

    /** Schedule a timer to retry {@link #getRootRegion} after some time.  */
    private void retryGetRootRegionLater() {
      newTimeout(new TimerTask() {
          public void run(final Timeout timeout) {
            if (!getRootRegion()) {  // Try to read the znodes
              connectZK();  // unless we need to connect first.
            }
```
