The conflict is in the Javadoc comment section where line breaks and spacing differ. Since both versions contain the same semantic content, just formatted slightly differently, the resolution is to choose one format. The version from the commit with the hash "a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe" seems to remove an extra line break which was present in the HEAD version. The intent is likely about maintaining consistent Javadoc formatting.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
    createdTime = toDateFromLongFormat(rawCreatedTime);
  }

  /**
   * Post-JSON-mapping operation that populates the {@code messageTags} field "by hand".
   * @param jsonMapper
   *          The {@code JsonMapper} that was used to map to this type.
   */
  @JsonMappingCompleted
  protected void jsonMappingCompleted(JsonMapper jsonMapper) {
```
