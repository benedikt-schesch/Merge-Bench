To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine which approach is correct. The HEAD version assumes `Spout.getPluginManager()` returns a `PluginManager` directly, while the other version explicitly casts it. Given potential changes in method return types, casting might be necessary. 

The correct resolution is to adopt the version with the cast to ensure compatibility.

```java
	private DateFormat dateFormat;
	private List<Widget> lines = new ArrayList<Widget>();
	private float scroll = 0;

	public DevConsole(Font font) {
		this.plugin = ((PluginManager) Spout.getPluginManager()).getMetaPlugin();
		this.font = font;
		init();
	}
	
	public void clearConsole() {
```
