To resolve the conflict, we'll use the more efficient and idiomatic approach of `toArray(new Player[0])`.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
   * @return The {@code Player} object representing {@code user} in this game, or {@code null} if
   * {@code user} is not in this game.
   */
  @Nullable
  public Player getPlayerForUser(final User user) {
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      if (player.getUser() == user) {
        return player;
      }
    }
  }
```
