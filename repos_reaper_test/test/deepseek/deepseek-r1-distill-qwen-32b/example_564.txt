The conflict occurs in a test method `checkInvalidJson()` that expects to throw `FacebookJsonMappingException` when creating a `Connection` with invalid JSON. One side of the conflict removes the exception check, while the other keeps it. Since the test's purpose is to validate exception handling, we should preserve the exception check.

Here is the resolved code with the exception check preserved:

```java
  }

  @Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)
  public void checkInvalidJson() {
    new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST), "{", User.class);
    failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(FacebookJsonMappingException.class);
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_reachAllElements() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();
```
