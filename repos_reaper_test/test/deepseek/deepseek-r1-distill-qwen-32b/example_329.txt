The merge conflict is over the condition for checking the position index in the `if` statement. The intent appears to be ensuring 
the position is a valid index for the adapter. Both sides are checking `position < mUserListAdapter.getCount()` but there's a 
difference in whether to also check `position >= 0`. 

I will resolve the conflict by using the bounds check from the other branch since it's more complete.

```java
	@Override
	protected User getContextItemUser(int position) {
		// position = position - 1;
		Log.d(TAG, "list position:" + position);
		// 加入footer跳过footer
		if (position >=0 && position < mUserListAdapter.getCount()) {

			User item = (User) mUserListAdapter.getItem(position);
			if (item == null) {
				return null;
			} else {

```
