The merge conflict in the `checkIterator_withCursor` test method involves two different assertion styles: `assertThat` with `isEqualTo` and `assertEquals`. Both lines are functionally equivalent but use different assertion syntaxes.

Given the intent appears to be simply testing the cursor values, either approach is valid. However, since the change appears to be stylistic rather than functional, I'll keep the original `assertThat` style from the local version to maintain consistency with the existing codebase.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_withCursor() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = createCursorConnection();
    assertThat(connection.getAfterCursor()).isEqualTo("NzU1MjI1MjU0");
    assertThat(connection.getBeforeCursor()).isEqualTo("MTY1MTAyNjUxNg==");
  }

  private Connection<FacebookType> createCursorConnection() {
    FakeWebRequestor fakeWebRequestor = new FakeWebRequestor() {
      @Override
```
