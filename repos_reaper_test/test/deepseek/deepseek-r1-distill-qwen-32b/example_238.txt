The merge conflict appears to be around the license header. On one side (HEAD), the license text is slightly different, and on the other side (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309), the correct Apache Software License header is added.

Since both sides seem to be related to license text, but one side adds the proper Apache Software License header while the other side appears to have a malformed version, we should resolve this by keeping the proper Apache Software License header.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java

 * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
 * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
 * limitations under the License.
 */
/*

```

Wait, I realize now that the HEAD side doesn't actually have any content; it's just empty lines, while the other side adds the proper license header. So the correct resolution is to include the proper license header.
