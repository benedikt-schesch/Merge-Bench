The code snippet involves a merge conflict between two versions of a comment. Both comments are identical except for the spacing after the comment delimiter. Since the functional intent is the same, the conflict can be resolved by choosing one comment style.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java
    public Result getNext() throws ExecException {
        if (bags == null) {
            return new Result(POStatus.STATUS_EOP, null);
        }

        // Create numInputs bags
        Object[] fields = new Object[mBags.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < mBags.length; i++) {
            if (mBags[i]) fields[i] = createDataBag(numBags);
        }
    }
```

The conflict was resolved by selecting the comment from one side, removing the merge conflict markers, and presenting the code cleanly.
