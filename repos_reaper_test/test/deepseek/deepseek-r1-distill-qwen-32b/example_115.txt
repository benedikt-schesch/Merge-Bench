The merge conflict in the imports needs to be resolved by choosing the correct package for ExpectedException and including Fail if necessary. The newer import from the other branch is likely correct.

```java
import static org.fest.util.ExpectedException.none;

import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.fest.assertions.api.Fail;
import org.fest.assertions.test.ExpectedException;

/**
 * Tests for <code>{@link Fail#failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(Class)}</code>.
 * 
 * @author Joel Costigliola
