**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Conflict:** Both sides declare `private boolean[] mBags;` with the same purpose but differ in comment formatting.

2. **Evaluate Intent:** The purpose of `mBags` is clear in both comments, indicating no functional change, only formatting.

3. **Resolve Stylistic Difference:** Choose one comment format without affecting functionality.

4. **Final Choice:** Opt for the concise comment style from the HEAD as it is equally clear and maintains code brevity.

Here is the merged code:

```java
 * it does not use the index in the NullableTuple to find the bag to put a
 * tuple in.  Instead, the inputs are put in a bag corresponding to their
 * offset in the tuple.
 */
public class CombinerPackager extends Packager {
    private boolean[] mBags; // For each field, indicates whether or not it
                             // needs to be put in a bag.

    private Map<Integer, Integer> keyLookup;

    private int numBags;
