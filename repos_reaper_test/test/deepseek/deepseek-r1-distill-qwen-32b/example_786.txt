To resolve the merge conflict, we should choose the version that adds generic type safety, as it improves code quality by preventing raw type usage and potential runtime errors.

```java
   * @param deferred A deferred one can wait on before retrying the failed RPC.
   */
  PleaseThrottleException(final String msg,
                          final HBaseException cause,
                          final HBaseRpc rpc,
                          final Deferred<?> deferred) {
    super(msg, cause);
    this.rpc = rpc;
    this.deferred = deferred;
  }
```
