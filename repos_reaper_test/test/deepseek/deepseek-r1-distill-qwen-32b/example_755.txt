Based on the intent analysis, here's the resolution:

```java
        ((EditText) view.findViewById(R.id.passwordText)).setTypeface(monoTypeface);

        builder.setPositiveButton(getResources().getString(R.string.dialog_ok), new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
                EditText edit = (EditText) callingActivity.findViewById(R.id.crypto_password_edit);
                EditText generate = (EditText) view.findViewById(R.id.passwordText);
                edit.append(generate.getText());
            }
        });

        builder.setNegativeButton(getResources().getString(R.string.dialog_cancel), new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
```

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identified Conflicting Code Sections:**
   - The conflict was within the `onClick` method of the positive button in a dialog.
   - Both sides were attempting to access two views (` crypto_password_edit` and `passwordText`).

2. **Analyzed View Types:**
   - LEFT: Both views were declared as `TextView`.
   - RIGHT: Both views were declared as `EditText`.

3. **Determined Correct View Types:**
   - Since `passwordText` is used as an `EditText` earlier in the code (`(EditText) view.findViewById(R.id.passwordText)`), the right side's `EditText` declaration is correct.

4. **Resolved View Access Methods:**
   - Right side correctly used `callingActivity.findViewById()` instead of `getActivity().findViewById()`.
   - Used `view.findViewById()` for the dialog's view.

5. **SELECTED RIGHT SIDE Changes:**
   - Properly typed views as `EditText`.
   - Correctly referenced the views via `callingActivity` and `view`.

6. **Resulting Code:**
   - Incorporates the right side's correct view declarations and access methods.
   - Maintains the intended functionality of appending password text.
