The code snippet shows a merge conflict between a class `PageRestaurantSpecialties` in the HEAD branch and another commit. The HEAD branch includes a `serialVersionUID`, while the other commit introduces a `breakfast` field. The goal is to resolve this conflict by including both contributions.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageRestaurantSpecialties extends AbstractFacebookType {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private Boolean breakfast;

```
