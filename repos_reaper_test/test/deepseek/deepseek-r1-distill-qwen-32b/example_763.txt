The merge conflict appears to be around the condition for checking if we should piggyback a version request. From the HEAD side, the code has a condition that is effectively always false due to the `false &&` part. From the other side (commit 8063e77), the code correctly uses the `!isVersionRequest(payload)` condition. The intent seems to be to only skip piggybacking the version request if the payload is already a version request.

Given that the intent is clear, we'll adopt the simpler and correct condition from the other side.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
        // Piggyback a version request in the 1st packet, after the payload
        // we were trying to send.  This way we'll have the version handy
        // pretty quickly.  Since it's most likely going to fit in the same
        // packet we send out, it adds ~zero overhead.  But don't piggyback
        // a version request if the payload is already a version request.
        final ChannelBuffer buf;
        if (!isVersionRequest(payload)) {
          final RegionClient client = ctx.getPipeline().get(RegionClient.class);
          final ChannelBuffer version =
            client.encode(client.getProtocolVersionRequest());
          buf = ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(header, payload, version);
        } else {
```
