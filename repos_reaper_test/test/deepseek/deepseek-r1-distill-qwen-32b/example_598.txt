The code snippet provided contains a merge conflict where one side introduces a `serialVersionUID` field while the other side adds a `catering` field with annotations. Since these changes are independent and non-overlapping, both should be retained.

Here is the resolved snippet with both changes included:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageRestaurantServices extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private Boolean catering;

```
