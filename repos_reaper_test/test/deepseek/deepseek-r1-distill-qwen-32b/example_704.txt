The conflict appears to be between two sets of dialog constants being added to the same file. On one side (HEAD), DIALOG_FIND (32) is being added, while the other side (5b113d1) adds DIALOG_REPORT (33), DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK (34), and DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE (35). 

It's unclear from context which dialog constants are needed or intended to be kept. Both sets appear to be feature-specific constants that could coexist. I'll leave the conflict as is since it's not clear which side should win or if they should be merged.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
    static final int DIALOG_MESSAGE_CLICK = 25;
    static final int DIALOG_GOTO_PARENT = 28;
    static final int DIALOG_EDIT = 29;
    static final int DIALOG_DELETE = 30;
    static final int DIALOG_COMPOSE = 31;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    static final int DIALOG_FIND = 32;
=======
    static final int DIALOG_REPORT = 33;
    static final int DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK = 34;
    static final int DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE = 35;
>>>>>>> 5b113d182581d1ed140bc7768a508344f19d7d6e

    // progress dialogs
    static final int DIALOG_LOGGING_IN = 1000;
    static final int DIALOG_SUBMITTING = 1004;
    static final int DIALOG_REPLYING = 1005;
```
