To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. The original code directly assigns the `versions` value. The conflicting change introduces bitwise operations, which likely aims to preserve certain flags while setting the maximum versions.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
  public GetRequest maxVersions(final int versions) {
    if (versions <= 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Need a strictly positive number: "
                                         + versions);
    }
    this.versions = (versions << 1) | (this.versions & EXIST_FLAG);
    return this;
  }

  /**
   * Returns the maximum number of versions to return for each cell scanned.
```
