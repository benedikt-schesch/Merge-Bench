To resolve the merge conflict, we consider the intent of both changes. The line initializing `batched_rpcs` without `server_version` might be an oversight if that parameter is required. Therefore, using the parameterized constructor is likely the correct approach.

```java
    MultiAction batch;
    boolean schedule_flush = false;

    synchronized (this) {
      if (batched_rpcs == null) {
        batched_rpcs = new MultiAction(server_version);
        addMultiActionCallbacks(batched_rpcs);
        schedule_flush = true;
      }
      batch = batched_rpcs;
      // Unfortunately we have to hold the monitor on `this' while we do
```
