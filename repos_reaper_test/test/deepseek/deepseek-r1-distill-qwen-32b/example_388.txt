Here is the resolved code snippet with both the `@AfterEach` verification and the new test case. I've merged them together since they both serve different but valid purposes in the test context.

```java
	void inContext() {
		workspace = mock(WorkspaceFacade.class);
		processor = new ClassFileChangeProcessor(workspace);
	}

	@AfterEach
	void verifyWorkspace() {
		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

	@Test
	void shouldNotRespondToPreBuildEvents() {
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, PRE_BUILD, AUTO_BUILD, null);
		assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event));
	}
```
