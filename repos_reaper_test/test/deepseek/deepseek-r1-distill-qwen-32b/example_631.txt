The code snippet has a merge conflict in the Javadoc comment's @return statement. The goal is to resolve this conflict by considering the intent of both sides.

```java
   * The user's picture, if provided.
   * 
   * To force Facebook to fill the <code>picture</code> field you have to fetch the user with the
   * <code>fields=picture</code> parameter, otherwise the picture is <code>null</code>.
   * 
   * @return the user's picture as ProfilePictureSource object
   * @since 1.6.16
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
```

The conflict is in the `@return` line. The original version specifies the return type as `ProfilePictureSource` object, which is more precise and informative than just "picture object." Since `ProfilePictureSource` is the correct return type, we should use that version.

```java
   * The user's picture, if provided.
   * 
   * To force Facebook to fill the <code>picture</code> field you have to fetch the user with the
   * <code>fields=picture</code> parameter, otherwise the picture is <code>null</code>.
   * 
   * @return the user's picture as ProfilePictureSource object
   * @since 1.6.16
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
```
