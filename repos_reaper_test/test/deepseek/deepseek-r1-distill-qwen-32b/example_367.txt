To resolve the merge conflict, we need to include both the `addHeader` method and the `execute` method. The `addHeader` method adds functionality to handle headers, which is essential. The resolved code should maintain the proper structure with correct method placements.

```java
  public MockLowLevelHttpRequest(String url) {
    this.url = url;
  }

  @Override
  public void addHeader(String name, String value) {
    headers.put(name, value);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpResponse execute() throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpResponse();
  }
```
