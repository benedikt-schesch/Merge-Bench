I'll help resolve this merge conflict. Looking at the context, this appears to be a merge conflict in the import statements of a Java file. The conflicting changes are around the `GenericMath` import.

Since both `GenericMath` and the physics-related imports (`ReactDefaults` and `CollisionShape`) seem relevant to block characteristics, we should preserve both sets of imports.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import org.spout.api.material.range.EffectRange;
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.resource.SpoutModels;
import org.spout.api.util.bytebit.ByteBitSet;
import org.spout.api.util.flag.Flag;
import org.spout.math.GenericMath;
import org.spout.physics.ReactDefaults;
import org.spout.physics.collision.shape.CollisionShape;

/**
 * Defines the specific characteristics of a Block
```

The merge combines the imports from both branches since they all appear necessary for the class's functionality.
