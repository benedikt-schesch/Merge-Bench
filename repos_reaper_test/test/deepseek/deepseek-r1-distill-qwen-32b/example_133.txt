To resolve this conflict, we need to determine whether adding the `final` modifier to the `sJobConfInternal` field is appropriate given the intent of both sides of the merge.

The change from both sides:
- The `HEAD` side declares `sJobConfInternal` as a mutable `ThreadLocal`.
- The other side (`57eb1bac`) declares `sJobConfInternal` as a `final` immutable `ThreadLocal`.

Since both changes are relatively simple and the only difference is the addition of the `final` modifier, we can resolve this by taking the version that adds `final`, as immutability is generally a safer and better practice.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
     * <pre>UdfContext.getUdfContext().getJobConf()</pre>
     */
    @Deprecated
    public static Configuration sJobConf = null;

    public static final ThreadLocal<Configuration> sJobConfInternal = new ThreadLocal<Configuration>();

    public static class Map extends PigMapBase {

        @Override
        public void collect(Context oc, Tuple tuple)

```
