To resolve this merge conflict, we need to determine which version correctly accesses the commit message.

The conflict arises because:
- One side (`HEAD`) accesses `commit.commit.message`
- The other side (`c120f1d`) accesses `commit.message`

The intent is clearly to display the commit message, so both sides agree on that. The difference is whether the message is nested under another commit object or accessible directly.

Since modern APIs typically flatten such structures, `commit.message` is likely the correct and more direct access.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
@Override
public void onResponse(Commit commit, boolean firstTime) {

    if (commit.commit != null && commit.commit.message != null) {
        commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.message));
    }

    User author = commit.author;

    if (author != null) {

    }
}
```
