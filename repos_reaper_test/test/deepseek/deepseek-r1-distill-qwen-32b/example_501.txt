To resolve the conflict, we should adopt the change to `BitmapTextureAtlas` as it aligns with the intention to improve font rendering efficiency using a texture atlas, as indicated by the commit message. This approach is suitable for handling multiple font textures efficiently.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```java

	private Rectangle mBall;
	private final SparseArray<Rectangle> mPaddleMap = new SparseArray<Rectangle>();
	private final SparseArray<ChangeableText> mScoreChangeableTextMap = new SparseArray<ChangeableText>();
	
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mScoreFontTexture;
	private Font mScoreFont;

	private float mPaddleCenterY;
