The code should be resolved by using the diamond operator without explicit type parameters to align with modern Java practices and maintain consistency. Here's the resolution:

```java
   *                        sent to people in the game.
   * @return This game's general information: ID, host, state, player list, etc.
   */
  @Nullable
  public Map<GameInfo, Object> getInfo(final boolean includePassword) {
    final Map<GameInfo, Object> info = new HashMap<>();
    info.put(GameInfo.ID, id);
    // This is probably happening because the game ceases to exist in the middle of getting the
    // game list. Just return nothing.
    if (null == host) {
      return null;

```
