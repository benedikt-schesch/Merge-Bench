To resolve this conflict, we need to ensure that the constructor of `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` is appropriately utilized.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Understand the Constructors**: Check the constructors available for `MockLowLevelHttpRequest`. If only a parameterless constructor exists, use `new MockLowLevelHttpRequest()`. If a constructor that accepts a `String url` is available and intended for use, that should be preferred.

2. **Determine the Correct Intent**: If the method `buildGetRequest` is supposed to utilize the provided URL, then including the URL parameter is appropriate. If not, omitting it is correct.

3. **Choose Based on Context**: If the mock requires the URL to function correctly, pass it as in the other commit. Otherwise, revert to the original.

**Resolution:**
```java
>>>>>>> f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b
}
  
  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildGetRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }
  
  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildHeadRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    if (!supportsHead()) {
>>>>>>> f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b
```

Thus, the correct line is `return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);`.
