The given Java code snippet contains a merge conflict where both sides are trying to instantiate a class with parameters. The conflict arises from different ways of checking the number of arguments. One side uses `args.size()` (assuming `args` is a collection), while the other uses `args.length` (assuming `args` is an array). Both aim to get the parameter types correctly, but their approaches differ based on the type of `args`.

Since the conflict is about the nature of `args`, the correct resolution depends on whether `args` is an array or a collection. Without additional context, the safest approach is to preserve the conflict and request clarification on the intended type of `args`.

```java
            throw new RuntimeException("Cannot instantiate:" + className, ioe) ;
        }

        try {
            // Do normal instantiation

                    paramTypes[i] = String.class;
                }
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(paramTypes);
