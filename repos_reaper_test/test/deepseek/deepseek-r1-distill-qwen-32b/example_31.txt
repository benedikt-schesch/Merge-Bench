To resolve the merge conflict, we need to decide between two versions of the code. The main differences are:

1. The import or utility class used: Matrix4 vs MatrixMath.
2. The use of 'this.' to qualify the projection field.

Given that the method `getProjection()` returns a Matrix4, and assuming that `projection` is a Matrix4 field, both lines aim to assign a perspective matrix. However, the choice between Matrix4 and MatrixMath depends on which utility is correct for the current project setup.

If MatrixMath is the intended utility for creating perspectives, then using it with 'this.' would be correct. Therefore, the resolved code should take the version from the cc070305... commit.

**Resolved code:**

```java
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public void onAttached() {
		// TODO: Get FOV
		this.projection = MatrixMath.createPerspective(fieldOfView, 4.0f / 3.0f, .001f, 1000f);
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public Matrix4 getProjection() {
```
