I'll help resolve this merge conflict by considering the intent and semantics of both changes.

The left side (HEAD) shows:
- Constructor parameter types: `LitePackager`, `Iterator<NullableTuple>`, `Object`
- Field assignments remain consistent with these types

The right side shows:
- Constructor parameter types: `Packager`, `Iterator<NullableTuple>`, `PigNullableWritable`
- Field assignments remain consistent with these types

The key differences are:
1. `Packager` vs `LitePackager`
2. `Object` vs `PigNullableWritable` for the key parameter
3. Field name changes from `key` to `keyWritable`

Given that `Packager` is a more general type than `LitePackager`, and `PigNullableWritable` is likely a more specific type than `Object`, I'll resolve this by taking the more specific types from both sides.

Here's the resolved version:

```java
     * copying the elements of the iterator.
     * @param pkg POPackageLite
     * @param tupIter Iterator<NullableTuple>
     * @param key Object
     */
    public ReadOnceBag(Packager pkgr, Iterator<NullableTuple> tupIter,
            PigNullableWritable key) {
        this.pkgr = pkgr;
        this.tupIter = tupIter;
        this.key = key;
    }
```

I've:
1. Used `Packager` instead of `LitePackager` as it's likely a supertype
2. Used `PigNullableWritable` for the key type
3. Kept the field assignments consistent
4. Maintained the existing field naming convention (`key` vs `keyWritable`)
