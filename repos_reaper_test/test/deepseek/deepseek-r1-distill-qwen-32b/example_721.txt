The merge conflict is between two changes within the `onFinished` method of an anonymous class. On one side (HEAD), there's a logging statement being added, while on the other side (2d5250293...), that logging statement is removed in favor of posting a `ReloadMessagesEvent`.

Semantically, the intent appears to be about handling a failed message deletion. The original code included posting a reload event after deleting a failed message. The HEAD commit adds a logging statement for debugging, while the other commit removes that logging in favor of keeping only the reload logic.

Both changes seem valid but serve different purposes:
1. Logging provides debugging information
2. Reloading messages updates the UI to reflect the deletion

To resolve this, we can merge both changes by including both the log and the reload event for comprehensive handling.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                            @Override
                            public void onFinished(Void result) {
                                UiThread.getInstance().post(new Runnable() {
                                    @Override
                                    public void run() {
                                        Logger.log(SmsSentReceiver.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed message deleted ");
                                        App.bus.post(new ReloadMessagesEvent());
                                    }
                                });
                            }
```
