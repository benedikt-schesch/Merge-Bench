To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine the correct code intent.

**Analysis:** 
- The conflict appears between initializing `myGestureListener` and attaching it to `getTweetList()`. Both changes are about gesture detection but occur in different places.
- The line `getTweetList().setOnTouchListener(myGestureListener);` is essential for attaching the listener to the view hierarchy, ensuring gestures are detected.

**Resolution:** 
Include both lines to ensure the gesture listener is properly initialized and attached.

```java
    // use it in _onCreate
    private void registerGestureListener() {
        if (useGestrue) {
            myGestureListener = new FlingGestureListener(this,
                    MyActivityFlipper.create(this));
            getTweetList().setOnTouchListener(myGestureListener);
        }
    }

}
```
