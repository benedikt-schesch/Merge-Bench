To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine the proper placement of the `@Private` annotation and the `getPigContext()` method while ensuring both the intent and semantics of both sides are respected.

## Analysis of the Conflict
- **HEAD Branch**: This appears to be the resolution after a failed attempt to start the Pig server. It includes catching exceptions, breaking out of loops, and closing resources.
- **Other Branch (f6a8f7aa)**: Introduces a new method `getPigContext()` annotated with `@Private`, which suggests it's intended to be accessed internally but not externally. This method likely allows controlled access to the `pigContext` variable.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Intent of `getPigContext()`**: The addition of this method suggests there's a need internally to access the Pig context. The `@Private` annotation indicates it's meant to be used within the package or by specific classes.
2. **Purpose of `@Private` Annotation**: This annotation is often used to control visibility in frameworks or libraries, ensuring that methods aren't exposed publicly unless intended.
3. **Conflict Source**: The conflict arises because one version includes this method, while the other does not.

### Possible Resolutions:
- **Option 1**: Include the `getPigContext()` method if it serves a valid internal purpose and aligns with the class's responsibilities.
- **Option 2**: Omit the method if it's unnecessary or if access to `pigContext` should remain encapsulated.

### Final Decision:
Given the `@Private` annotation and assuming the method is needed for internal operations, the method should be included. If it's determined that exposing `pigContext` this way is unnecessary, the method should be omitted.

## Merged Code
```java
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    @Private
    public PigContext getPigContext() {
        return pigContext;
    }

    public void start() {
        startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        userId = System.getProperty("user.name");
    }
```

### Explanation:
- The `getPigContext()` method has been added before the `start()` method. This placement keeps related methods together, improving code readability and maintainability.

Note: If the inclusion of `getPigContext()` is deemed unnecessary, this method should be removed, and the context should revert to its original state.
