The intent of both changes is unclear without additional context about why the `PullToRefreshListView` was replaced with a standard `ListView`. 

HEAD side seems to be using a PullToRefreshListView which suggests support for pull-to-refresh functionality, while the other side uses a standard ListView. Both options are valid depending on whether pull-to-refresh functionality is needed.

I will leave the conflict unresolved because the intent behind the change is ambiguous.

```java

	@Override
	protected void setupState() {
		setTitle(getActivityTitle());

<<<<<<< HEAD
		mUserList = (PullToRefreshListView) findViewById(R.id.follower_list);
=======
		mUserList = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.follower_list);
>>>>>>> 5f1eecd58485bc3b7c0bc8e0b479d0b2d40f344b

		setupListHeader(true);

		mUserListAdapter = new UserArrayAdapter(this);
		mUserList.setAdapter(mUserListAdapter);

```
