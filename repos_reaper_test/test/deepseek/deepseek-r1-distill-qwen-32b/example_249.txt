To resolve this conflict, we observe that both versions are semantically identical, differing only in formatting. The goal is to maintain consistent code style while preserving functionality.

Here is the resolved code snippet, consolidating both into a single clean version:

```java
     * @throws IOException on failure
     */
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    static void passLoadSignature(LoadFunc loadFunc, int inputIndex,
            Configuration conf) throws IOException {
        List<String> inpSignatureLists =
                (ArrayList<String>) ObjectSerializer.deserialize(
                        conf.get("pig.inpSignatures"));
        // signature can be null for intermediate jobs where it will not
        // be required to be passed down
        if (inpSignatureLists.get(inputIndex) != null) {
            loadFunc.setUDFContextSignature(inpSignatureLists.get(inputIndex));
            conf.set("pig.loader.signature", inpSignatureLists.get(inputIndex));
        }
    }
```

The resolution combines the best of both formatting styles, using proper indentation and line breaks for readability while keeping the same functionality.
