The merge conflict involves the visibility of `snapshotManager` and additional variable declarations. The right side declares `snapshotManager` as `private` and adds more variables. Since these new variables are part of the same class, `snapshotManager` can remain `private`. Therefore, the right side's changes are integrated.

```java
	private final PluginManager pluginManager = new PluginManager(this, securityManager, 0.0);
	private final ConsoleManager consoleManager;
	private final EventManager eventManager = new SimpleEventManager();
	private final RecipeManager recipeManager = new SimpleRecipeManager();
	private final ServiceManager serviceManager = new ServiceManager();
	private final SnapshotManager snapshotManager = new SnapshotManager();
	protected final SnapshotableLinkedHashMap<String, SpoutPlayer> players = new SnapshotableLinkedHashMap<String, SpoutPlayer>(snapshotManager);
	private final WorldGenerator defaultGenerator = new EmptyWorldGenerator();
	protected final SpoutSessionRegistry sessions = new SpoutSessionRegistry();
	protected final SpoutScheduler scheduler = new SpoutScheduler(this);
	protected final SpoutParallelTaskManager parallelTaskManager = new SpoutParallelTaskManager(this);
	private final AtomicBoolean setupComplete = new AtomicBoolean(false);
	private final SpoutConfiguration config = new SpoutConfiguration();
	private final SpoutInputConfiguration inputConfig = new SpoutInputConfiguration();
```
