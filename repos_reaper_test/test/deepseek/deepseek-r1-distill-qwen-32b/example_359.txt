The merge conflict appears to have both versions describing the same functionality with minor wording differences. The intent is to clarify that when `data` is a `Map`, parameter values are stored either as strings or in an `ArrayList<String>` for repeated parameters. Given the ambiguity in the exact intended wording, the conflict is resolved by presenting both versions side by side for the maintainer to decide.

```java
   * parameter is the declared field class. Declared fields of type {@link Collection} are used to
   * support repeating data key names, so each member of the collection is an additional data key
   * value. They are parsed the same as "primitive" fields, except that the generic type parameter
   * of the collection is used as the {@link Class} parameter.
   * </p>

   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
