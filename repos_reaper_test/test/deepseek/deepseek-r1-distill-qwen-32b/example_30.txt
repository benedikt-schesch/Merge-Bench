To resolve the merge conflict while considering the intent and semantics, both imports are necessary as they serve different purposes. The `Vector3` import is for mathematical operations, while `Client` is for handling client-side functionality. Therefore, including both imports ensures all dependencies are covered.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

import org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.HashCodeBuilder;

import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.Client;
import org.spout.api.Platform;
import org.spout.api.Spout;
import org.spout.api.component.BaseComponentOwner;
import org.spout.api.component.Component;
import org.spout.api.component.entity.EntityComponent;
