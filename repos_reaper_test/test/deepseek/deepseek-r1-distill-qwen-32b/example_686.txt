I've resolved the conflict by:
1. Using the more precise wording from the second version ("grants" instead of "resource access permissions")
2. Keeping the exclamation mark at the end of the warning message for emphasis
3. Using the sorted stream version of joining the ambiguousPrincipals list
4. Adding the missing text variable to the logger.info call

The changes maintain the same overall intent while improving clarity and consistency.
