To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the correct initialization of the `SpriteBatch` in the context of handling multiple sprites.

The correct version uses `mBitmapTextureAtlas` because it's properly managing the sprites for the SpriteBatch.

```java
		
		faceSprite1.setScale(2);
		faceSprite2.setRotation(45);

		/* Create the face and add it to the scene. */
		final SpriteBatch dynamicSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, 2) {
			@Override
			public void onDrawSpriteBatch() {
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
				this.draw(faceSprite2);
			}

```
