To resolve the merge conflict, we choose the version that uses the diamond operator for conciseness and modern Java practices. The lines are functionally equivalent, differing only in syntax.

```java
      synchronized (players) {
        for (final Player player : players) {
          if (getJudge() == player) {
            continue;
          }
          final List<WhiteCard> cards = new ArrayList<>(newBlackCard.getDraw());
          for (int i = 0; i < newBlackCard.getDraw(); i++) {
            cards.add(getNextWhiteCard());
          }
          player.getHand().addAll(cards);
          sendCardsToPlayer(player, cards);
