To resolve this conflict, we should merge the changes to include both assignments from the right side while keeping the original assignment from the left side. This ensures the Packager instance is properly initialized with its parent and illustrator.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
        return pkgr;
    }

    public void setPkgr(Packager pkgr) {
        this.pkgr = pkgr;
        pkgr.setParent(this);
        pkgr.setIllustrator(illustrator);
    }

    /**
     * Make a deep copy of this operator.
     * @throws CloneNotSupportedException
```
