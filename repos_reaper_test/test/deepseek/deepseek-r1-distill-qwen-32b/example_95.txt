To resolve this merge conflict, we need to reconcile the two versions of creating a `Game` object while preserving all necessary constructor arguments.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:
1. Both versions aim to create a `Game` object with similar parameters
2. The main difference is the number of arguments - one version has 13 parameters, the other has 15
3. The context shows this is part of a test that verifies game state after adding/removing games

Since the Game constructor appears to have changed, we should preserve all parameters to ensure proper initialization.

Resolved code:

```java

    // remove game 1 out from under it, to make sure it'll fix itself
    gameManager.getGames().remove(1);
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
    gameManager.getGames().put(1,
        new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));
    assertEquals(-1, gameManager.get().intValue());

    gameManager.destroyGame(2);
    gameManager.destroyGame(0);
    assertEquals(2, gameManager.get().intValue());

```
