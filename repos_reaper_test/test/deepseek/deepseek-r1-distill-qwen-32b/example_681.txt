The merge conflict involves differences in the logger message and the way principals are displayed. Both sides aim to inform about missing principals but use "permissions" vs "grants" and different joining methods. Here's the resolved code incorporating the more descriptive terms and a sorted list:

```java
						+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf\">pre-deploy.conf</a> and re-importing.";

				logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
						+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
						+ "\tThe following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during deployment.\n"
						+ "\tBecause of these missing grants/ownerships, the functionality is not identical to the export you just imported!\n\n"
						+ "\t" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
						+ "\n\n\tConsider adding these principals to your 'pre-deploy.conf' (see https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf) and re-importing.\n"
						+ "###############################################################################"
				);
				publishWarningMessage(title, text);
			}
```
