I've analyzed the merge conflict and determined the appropriate resolution.

The code in HEAD is simpler but less safe as it directly calls `startCamera()` without a null check. 
The conflicting code added a null safety check using `myDecoderView` instead of `qrCodeReaderView`.
The correct approach is to keep the null safety check but use the correct view variable name.

Here is the resolved code:

```java
  }

  @Override protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();

    if (qrCodeReaderView != null) {
      qrCodeReaderView.startCamera();
    }
  }

  @Override protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
```
