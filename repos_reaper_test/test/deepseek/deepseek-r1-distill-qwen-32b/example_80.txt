The conflict in the `getString()` method is resolved by removing the redundant `public` keyword since it's implicit in interface methods. The second method's conflict remains unresolved due to incomplete context.

```java
   */
  public interface DoubleLocalizable {
    /**
     * @return The first user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     */
    String getString();

    /**
     * @return The second user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     */
