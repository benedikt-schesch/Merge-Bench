Based on the context and the potential intent of both sides of the merge, here's how I would resolve the conflict:

```java
            // with the new indexed key
            addShiftedKeyInfoIndex(initial, fromPkgr);
        }

        int total = current - initial;

        MultiQueryPackager toPkgr = (MultiQueryPackager) ((POPackage) to
                .getRoots().get(0)).getPkgr();
        int pkCount = 0;
        if (fromPkgr instanceof MultiQueryPackager) {
            List<Packager> pkgs = ((MultiQueryPackager) fromPkgr)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
1. I assumed that the intent of both changes was to maintain the calculation of `total` and to include the additional logic related to `MultiQueryPackager`.
2. Kept the `int total = current - initial;` line from the HEAD version as it seems important for the calculation.
3. Included the additional logic related to `MultiQueryPackager` from the other branch since it appears to be necessary for functionality.

However, if the calculation of `total` is not essential or if the `MultiQueryPackager` logic is conflicting, the same snippet with the conflict should be preserved. More context would be needed to make a definitive resolution.
