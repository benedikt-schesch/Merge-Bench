>>>>>>> The merge conflict involves how the GruntParser is initialized. One side uses `new GruntParser(new StringReader(script))` while the other uses `new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig)`. The correct resolution depends on the purpose of the `myPig` argument. Assuming `myPig` is a Pig instance that's necessary for the parser's functionality, the version with `myPig` should be used.

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "dump b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
