To resolve the merge conflict, we'll combine both changes while preserving their intended functionality.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identify the intent of each change:**
   - The first change (`try-catch` block) initializes a sound resource.
   - The second change adds texture loading and an FPS logger.

2. **Preserve both functionalities:**
   - Keep the sound initialization.
   - Add texture loading after the sound initialization.
   - Retain the `onLoadScene` method.

3. **Resolve the conflict by integrating both changes seamlessly.**

```java
		try {
			this.mExplosionSound = SoundFactory.createSoundFromAsset(this.mEngine.getSoundManager(), this, "explosion.ogg");
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```
