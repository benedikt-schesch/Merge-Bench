The merge conflict involves a choice between `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`. Both are used for efficiently building strings, but `StringBuilder` is preferred here as it's more performant in single-threaded scenarios without the need for synchronization.

```java
            return;

        case STRING: {
            // Gather up all the remaining arguments into a string and pass them into
            // grunt.
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            String remainders[] = opts.getRemainingArgs();
            for (int i = 0; i < remainders.length; i++) {
                if (i != 0) sb.append(' ');
                sb.append(remainders[i]);
            }

```
