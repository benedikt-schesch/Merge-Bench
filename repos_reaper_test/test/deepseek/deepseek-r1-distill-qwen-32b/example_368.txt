The VERSION string should be resolved to "1.4.0-alpha" as it represents the newer commit and likely reflects the intended version update.

```java
  /**
   * Current version of the Google API Client Library for Java.
   *
   * @since 1.3
   */
  public static final String VERSION = "1.4.0-alpha";

  /**
   * Line separator to use for this OS, i.e. {@code "\n"} or {@code "\r\n"}.
   */
  public static final String LINE_SEPARATOR = System.getProperty("line.separator");
```
