To resolve the merge conflict, the correct approach is to set both `retPos` and `newPos` to the initial position using `zStream.tell()`. This aligns with initializing both variables to the same starting point, which is semantically appropriate given their roles in tracking positions.

```java
    // and we set retPos to newPos once we have read a character from that block.
    // see getPos() for more detail
    private long retPos, newPos = -1;

    public CBZip2InputStream(SeekableInputStream zStream, int blockSize) throws IOException {
        retPos = newPos = zStream.tell();
        ll8 = null;
        tt = null;
        checkComputedCombinedCRC = blockSize == -1;
        bsSetStream(zStream);
        initialize(blockSize);
    }
```
