To resolve the merge conflict, we need to consider the intent of both sides. The conflicting code adds new variables for search functionality. Since these additions don't conflict with existing variables, they can be safely included.

Here is the merged code:

```java
    private String mEditTargetBody = null;
    private String mDeleteTargetKind = null;
    private boolean mShouldClearReply = false;
    private AsyncTask<?, ?, ?> mCurrentDownloadCommentsTask = null;
    private final Object mCurrentDownloadCommentsTaskLock = new Object();
    private String last_search_string;
    private int last_found_position = -1;
    private int translucent_yellow;
    // ProgressDialogs with percentage bars
    private AutoResetProgressDialog mLoadingCommentsProgress;
    
    private boolean mCanChord = false;
    
    // override transition animation available Android 2.0 (SDK Level 5) and above
    private static Method mActivity_overridePendingTransition;
```
