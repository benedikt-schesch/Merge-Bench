Since both sides of the conflict are making distinct changes to how the result is being handled, and the intent is not clear on which approach should be taken, I will leave the merge conflict unresolved.

```java
            // and return it.
            pkgr.attachInput(key, dbs, readOnce);
            detachInput();
        }

<<<<<<< HEAD
        Result r = pkgr.getNext();
        Tuple packedTup = (Tuple) r.result;
        packedTup = illustratorMarkup(null, packedTup, 0);
        return r;

        return pkgr.getNext();

    public Packager getPkgr() {
        return pkgr;
    }
