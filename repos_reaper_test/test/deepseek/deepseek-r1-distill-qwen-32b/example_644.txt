To resolve the merge conflict, we need to determine the correct assertion method to use. Since the surrounding code uses `assertEquals`, we'll maintain consistency and resolve the conflict by keeping the right side's change.

```java

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_imagePng() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.png", attachmentData.getBytes());
    assertEquals("image/png", att.getContentType());
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_html() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";

```
