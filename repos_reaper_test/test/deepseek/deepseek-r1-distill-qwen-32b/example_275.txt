To resolve this merge conflict, we analyze the intent of both changes. The original code correctly uses the `pk` variable to get the `Packager`. The conflicting change incorrectly attempts to retrieve the `Packager` from `from.getRoots()` after `pk` has been removed. This would likely result in incorrect behavior or a null pointer exception.

The correct approach is to retain the original code, which correctly uses the `pk` variable.

```java
    private void mergeOneReducePlanWithIndex(PhysicalPlan from,
            PhysicalPlan to, int initial, int current, byte mapKeyType) throws VisitorException {
        POPackage pk = (POPackage)from.getRoots().get(0);
        from.remove(pk);
        Packager fromPkgr = pk.getPkgr();
        if (!(fromPkgr instanceof MultiQueryPackager)) {
            // XXX the index of the original keyInfo map is always 0,
            // we need to shift the index so that the lookups works
            // with the new indexed key
            addShiftedKeyInfoIndex(initial, fromPkgr);
```
