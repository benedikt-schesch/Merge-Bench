The merge conflict can be resolved by choosing the version that uses `keyWritable` as it's likely the intended source variable. Here is the resolved code:

```java
        Packager pkgr = packagers.get(index);

        // check to see if we need to unwrap the key. The keys may be
        // wrapped inside a tuple by LocalRearrange operator when jobs
        // with different map key types are merged
        PigNullableWritable curKey = keyWritable;
        if (!sameMapKeyType && !inCombiner && isKeyWrapped.get(index)) {
            Tuple tup = (Tuple) keyWritable.getValueAsPigType();
            curKey = HDataType.getWritableComparableTypes(tup.get(0),
                    pkgr.getKeyType());
            curKey.setIndex(origIndex);
        }
```
