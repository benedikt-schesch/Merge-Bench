The conflict arises when choosing between using `mBitmapTexture` or `mBitmapTextureAtlas` as the first argument in creating `SpriteBatch`. 

- **Branch (`HEAD`)** uses `mBitmapTexture`, which is likely a single bitmap texture.
- **Branch (`91801fdd7714...`)** uses `mBitmapTextureAtlas`, which is more likely a collection of textures (an atlas).

Given that the code later uses `mFaceTextureRegion` (which suggests multiple regions from an atlas), the correct argument should be the texture atlas.

**Resolved Snippet:**

```java
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
				this.draw(faceSprite2);
			}
		};
		
		final SpriteBatch staticSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, 2);
		staticSpriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, -50, 0, this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth(), this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight(), 2, 2);
		staticSpriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, 50, 0, this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth(), this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight(), 45);
		staticSpriteBatch.submit();

		dynamicSpriteBatch.setPosition(centerX, centerY - 50);
```
