To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be a part of a Spring-based application configuration, specifically dealing with social media integrations (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter). The imports are for various Spring Social classes that facilitate connections to these social media platforms.

The conflict arises between two commits:
1. The local commit (`HEAD`) that has imported `org.springframework.social.facebook.config.annotation.EnableFacebook;`
2. The incoming commit (`3ce669e268d814eac5a560d0f4ebdbece9a8a0cf`) that has imported several other classes related to Facebook and social connections, notably `ReconnectFilter`, `Facebook`, `FacebookTemplate`, `FacebookConnectionFactory`.

To resolve this conflict, we should consider the intent behind both sets of imports. The `HEAD` side is importing an annotation to enable Facebook configuration. The other side is importing various classes related to Facebook and social connections, which could be part of implementing or enhancing Facebook connection functionality.

Since both sides are importing different classes, and there's no direct duplication or conflict in the import statements themselves, the conflict can be resolved by combining the imports from both sides. This assumes that both sets of imports are necessary for the application.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
import org.springframework.social.connect.ConnectionFactoryLocator;
import org.springframework.social.connect.ConnectionRepository;
import org.springframework.social.connect.UsersConnectionRepository;
import org.springframework.social.connect.web.ConnectController;
import org.springframework.social.connect.web.ProviderSignInController;
import org.springframework.social.connect.web.ReconnectFilter;
import org.springframework.social.facebook.api.Facebook;
import org.springframework.social.facebook.api.impl.FacebookTemplate;
import org.springframework.social.facebook.config.annotation.EnableFacebook;
import org.springframework.social.facebook.connect.FacebookConnectionFactory;
import org.springframework.social.facebook.web.DisconnectController;
import org.springframework.social.linkedin.config.annotation.EnableLinkedIn;
import org.springframework.social.showcase.facebook.PostToWallAfterConnectInterceptor;
import org.springframework.social.showcase.signin.SimpleSignInAdapter;
import org.springframework.social.showcase.twitter.TweetAfterConnectInterceptor;
```

This resolution includes all imports from both sides, maintaining the original order as much as possible and ensuring that the resulting code snippet is semantically correct and comprehensive.
