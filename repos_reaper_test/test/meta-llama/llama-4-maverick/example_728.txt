To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The given code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of an Android application, specifically dealing with animations and view properties. The conflict arises between two commits: `HEAD` (the current branch) and `d28bc96faf3c28942720eaef1a486d601352d2d5`.

1. **Changes in `HEAD`**: The code in `HEAD` introduces a change related to setting the padding of a view (`this.setPadding(pad, pad, pad, pad);`). It retrieves a dimension pixel size from resources (`R.dimen.widget_container_padding`) and applies it as padding to the view.

2. **Changes in `d28bc96faf3c28942720eaef1a486d601352d2d5`**: The incoming change initializes `mRootAnimator` with `mRootView.animate()` and then proceeds to set an animation listener on `mRootAnimator` if it is not null.

The conflict occurs because both changes modify the same section of code, and Git cannot automatically merge them.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. The code in `HEAD` is adjusting the padding of a view, which is likely related to its layout or visual appearance. The change from `d28bc96faf3c28942720eaef1a486d601352d2d5` is related to animating the view (`mRootView`) and setting up an animation listener.

Since both changes seem to serve different purposes (one is related to view padding and the other to view animation), they can potentially be combined.

Here's the resolution:
```java
            setAlpha(0.0f);
            setScaleX(WIDGET_FADE_SCALE);
            setScaleY(WIDGET_FADE_SCALE);
            setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);

            // Set padding
            int pad = getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.widget_container_padding);
            this.setPadding(pad, pad, pad, pad);

            mRootAnimator = mRootView.animate();

            if (mRootAnimator != null) {
                mRootAnimator.setListener(new AnimatorListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onAnimationCancel(Animator arg0) {
```
