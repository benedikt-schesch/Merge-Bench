To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The original snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles socket implementations and logging. The method `createSocketImpl()` returns a new instance of `SSHSocketImpl`. There are logging-related methods in the class.

The conflict arises between two commits:
1. One commit (represented by `HEAD`) adds a `log` method that takes an integer and a string, logging an error with a message composed of the integer and string.
2. The other commit (with the hash `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) introduces a method `isEnabled` that checks if logging is enabled for a certain level (represented by an integer), defaulting to not logging anything (`return false;`).

The conflict is essentially about how to reconcile these two changes.

First, let's examine if the changes are semantically related or orthogonal. The `log` method and the `isEnabled` method serve different purposes. The `log` method is directly involved in logging a message, while `isEnabled` is used to determine whether logging should occur for a particular level.

Since these methods are distinct in their functionality and do not directly interfere with each other (they don't share the same name or purpose), a straightforward resolution could be to include both in the final merged version.

The original snippet with the conflict is:
```java
    public SocketImpl createSocketImpl() {
        return new SSHSocketImpl(session);

    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
	public void log(int arg0, String arg1) {
		log.error(arg0 + ": " + arg1);
	}
=======
    public boolean isEnabled(int arg0) {
        // Default to not logging anything
        return false;
    }
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309

    public void log(int arg0, String arg1) {
        log.error(arg0 + ": " + arg1);
    }


```

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent and semantics of both changes, we should include both the `log` method and the `isEnabled` method in the merged code. The duplicate `log` method declaration should be removed to avoid compilation issues.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
    public SocketImpl createSocketImpl() {
        return new SSHSocketImpl(session);

    }

    public boolean isEnabled(int arg0) {
        // Default to not logging anything
        return false;
    }

    public void log(int arg0, String arg1) {
        log.error(arg0 + ": " + arg1);
    }

```
