To resolve this merge conflict, let's first analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided is a part of a Java class that appears to be handling database operations related to account providers. The method `getParameters` fetches account provider parameters from a database using a JDBC template and maps the result to an `AccountProviderParameters` object.

The conflict arises in the `mapRow` method of the `RowMapper` anonymous class. Both versions of the code create a new `AccountProviderParameters` object, but they differ in the parameters they pass to its constructor.

The version from `HEAD` (the local changes) includes the following parameters:
- `provider`
- `rs.getString("displayName")`
- `encryptor.decrypt(rs.getString("apiKey"))`
- `encryptor.decrypt(rs.getString("secret"))`
- `rs.getLong("appId")`
- `rs.getString("requestTokenUrl")`
- `rs.getString("authorizeUrl")`
- `rs.getString("callbackUrl")`
- `rs.getString("accessTokenUrl")`

The version from `228af53d8db4ea1b58282f203bd404a3d011b7a8` (the changes being merged) includes:
- `provider`
- `encryptor.decrypt(rs.getString("apiKey"))`
- `encryptor.decrypt(rs.getString("secret"))`
- `rs.getLong("appId")`
- `rs.getString("requestTokenUrl")`
- `rs.getString("authorizeUrl")`
- `rs.getString("accessTokenUrl")`

The main difference is that the `HEAD` version includes `rs.getString("displayName")` and `rs.getString("callbackUrl")`, while the other version does not.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions. If the `displayName` and `callbackUrl` are crucial for the functionality intended by the local changes (`HEAD`), and their absence in the other version is not due to their being unnecessary or deprecated, then the `HEAD` version should be preferred. Conversely, if the changes being merged (`228af53d8db4ea1b58282f203bd404a3d011b7a8`) intentionally removed or never included `displayName` and `callbackUrl`, we should stick with that version.

Given the information, it seems that `displayName` and `callbackUrl` were either added or are considered necessary in the `HEAD` version. Without more context on why `228af53d8db4ea1b58282f203bd404a3d011b7a8` removed or didn't include them, the safest resolution to preserve functionality intended by both sides isn't straightforward.

However, since `callbackUrl` is present in the `HEAD` version but not in the version being merged, and there's no indication that `callbackUrl` is deprecated or unnecessary, we can attempt to merge the parameters by including all the necessary fields. 

Let's look at the constructor parameters for `AccountProviderParameters` in both versions. The version from `HEAD` has 9 parameters, while the version being merged has 7 parameters. The common parameters are `provider`, `apiKey`, `secret`, `appId`, `requestTokenUrl`, `authorizeUrl`, and `accessTokenUrl`. The `HEAD` version additionally includes `displayName` and `callbackUrl`.

To resolve, we will assume that `displayName` and `callbackUrl` are necessary. The merged version should include all necessary parameters.

Here is the resolution:
```java
	}
	
	private AccountProviderParameters getParameters(final String provider) {
		return jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(SELECT_ACCOUNT_PROVIDER_BY_NAME, new RowMapper<AccountProviderParameters>() {
			public AccountProviderParameters mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException {
				return new AccountProviderParameters(provider, rs.getString("displayName"), encryptor.decrypt(rs.getString("apiKey")), encryptor.decrypt(rs.getString("secret")), rs.getLong("appId"), rs.getString("requestTokenUrl"), rs.getString("authorizeUrl"), rs.getString("callbackUrl"), rs.getString("accessTokenUrl"));
			}
		}, provider);
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD

``` 
However, the above resolution directly favors the `HEAD` version. To properly resolve with markdown code syntax as requested and without modifying the context or spacing:
```java
	}
	
	private AccountProviderParameters getParameters(final String provider) {
		return jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(SELECT_ACCOUNT_PROVIDER_BY_NAME, new RowMapper<AccountProviderParameters>() {
			public AccountProviderParameters mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException {
				return new AccountProviderParameters(provider, rs.getString("displayName"), encryptor.decrypt(rs.getString("apiKey")), encryptor.decrypt(rs.getString("secret")), rs.getLong("appId"), rs.getString("requestTokenUrl"), rs.getString("authorizeUrl"), rs.getString("callbackUrl"), rs.getString("accessTokenUrl"));
			}
		}, provider);
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
