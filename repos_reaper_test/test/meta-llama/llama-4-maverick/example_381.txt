To resolve this conflict, let's analyze the code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The given snippet is a Java import section for an Android application. The conflict arises between the imports.

On one side (`HEAD`), we have:
```java
import android.os.Handler;
```

On the other side (`6252198314e0911154221dbed662947c98d77aa3`), we have:
```java
import android.content.pm.PackageManager;
```

Both imports are valid and serve different purposes. `android.os.Handler` is typically used for handling messages and runnables on a specific looper, often the main looper, which is crucial for updating the UI or performing actions that need to be on the main thread. On the other hand, `android.content.pm.PackageManager` is used to retrieve information about the packages (applications) installed on the device.

Given the context that follows the imports (other Android-related imports and the presence of `android.os.Looper`, `android.os.Message`), it seems both sides are working within an Android application framework. The presence of `Looper` and `Message` along with `Handler` suggests that the application is handling messages or performing operations that require threading or scheduling.

The intent seems to be to import necessary classes for the application's functionality. Since `Handler` and `PackageManager` serve different purposes and there's no indication that they're mutually exclusive or that one replaces the other, the conflict can be resolved by including both imports.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java

import android.content.ComponentName;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.ServiceConnection;
import android.os.Handler;
import android.content.pm.PackageManager;
import android.os.IBinder;
import android.os.Looper;
import android.os.Message;
import android.util.Log;
