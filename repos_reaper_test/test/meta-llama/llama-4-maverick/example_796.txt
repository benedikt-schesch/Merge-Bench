To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes proposed by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a method responsible for deserializing RPC (Remote Procedure Call) responses. The conflict arises in the `try` block where the `deserializeObject` method is called.

### Analysis of Changes

1. **Left Side (HEAD) Change**: The left side of the conflict (indicated by `<<<<<<< HEAD`) suggests calling `deserializeObject(buf, rpcid, rpc)`. This implies that the method `deserializeObject` requires three parameters: `buf`, `rpcid`, and `rpc`.

2. **Right Side Change (d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f)**: The right side (indicated by `>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`) suggests calling `deserializeObject(buf, rpc)`. This implies that the `deserializeObject` method requires two parameters: `buf` and `rpc`.

### Understanding Intent

- The left side includes `rpcid` as an additional argument, suggesting that the version of `deserializeObject` it is referencing might require or utilize an RPC ID.
- The right side omits `rpcid`, indicating either a different version of `deserializeObject` that doesn't need `rpcid` or a change in the method's signature.

### Resolving the Conflict

To resolve this, we need to understand the intent behind the change and the functionality of `deserializeObject`. 

1. If `deserializeObject` has been refactored to no longer require `rpcid`, and the removal of `rpcid` is a deliberate change (as indicated by the commit on the right side), we should align the call with the new method signature.

2. If `rpcid` is crucial for the deserialization process and its removal could lead to incorrect functionality or if the method still requires it, we should retain the `rpcid` parameter.

Given the information and without additional context on the `deserializeObject` method's signature and its requirements, we can't definitively resolve the conflict based solely on the provided snippet.

However, the change from `deserializeObject(buf, rpcid, rpc)` to `deserializeObject(buf, rpc)` suggests a potential simplification or change in the method's signature. 

Since we are to preserve the spacing and not modify the context, and without further details on the `deserializeObject` method, the most straightforward resolution based on the information given would be to directly choose one version if we were certain about the intent. 

But, to adhere strictly to the guidelines and without clear indication that one change is more correct than the other, the conflict should be returned as is if we're unsure.

Thus, the response, preserving the original formatting and conflict markers, is:

```java
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    if ((flags & HBaseRpc.RPC_ERROR) != 0) {
      return deserializeException(buf, rpc);
    }
    try {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      return deserializeObject(buf, rpcid, rpc);
=======
      return deserializeObject(buf, rpc);
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {  // The RPC didn't look good to us.
      return new InvalidResponseException(e.getMessage(), e);
    }
  }
```
