To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and involves the definition of annotations. Annotations in Java are a form of metadata that can be added to Java classes, methods, and variables. The snippet includes several annotations defined with the `@interface` keyword, some of which are annotated with `@BindingAnnotation` and `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)`, indicating they are used for dependency injection or other reflective purposes at runtime.

The conflict arises between two commits (or branches) that have modified the same part of the code in different ways. On one side (`HEAD`), there's an annotation named `@ServerDiscoveryPort`, and on the other side (`ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967`), there's an annotation named `@AllowBlankCards`.

Let's analyze the intent behind both changes:
1. The `@ServerDiscoveryPort` annotation might be used to specify a port for server discovery, potentially in a distributed system or a networked application.
2. The `@AllowBlankCards` annotation could be related to a card game or a similar context where "cards" are used, possibly indicating whether blank or empty cards are allowed in a certain context.

Both annotations seem to serve distinct purposes and are not directly related to each other based on their names and the context provided. 

To resolve the conflict, we need to decide whether both annotations are needed, or if one should override the other. Since there's no additional context that suggests one is more relevant than the other or that they are related in a way that would cause conflicts in their usage, the most straightforward resolution is to include both annotations.

Here's how the conflict can be resolved by including both annotations:

```java
  public @interface BannedNicks {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
  }
```

And here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
  public @interface BannedNicks {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
  }
```
