To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The provided Java code snippet appears to be part of a class that handles execution or configuration related to Map-Reduce jobs or Pig scripts, given the presence of `ExecutionEngine`, `jobName`, and `JobConf`. The snippet includes a merge conflict indicated by Git conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`).

Let's analyze the conflict:

- The local changes (`HEAD`) include:
  - A field `jobOutputFile` to store the output file of a Pig script.
  - A `JobConf` object named `jobConf` to presumably configure or hold the configuration of the currently executing Map-Reduce job.

- The changes from the other branch (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) do not introduce any new code between the conflict markers but introduce a `Properties` object named `properties`.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both sets of changes. The local changes (`HEAD`) seem to be related to handling or tracking the output of a Pig script and the configuration of a Map-Reduce job. The incoming changes introduce a `Properties` object, which could be used for configuration or storing other properties relevant to the execution or the class's functionality.

Since both sides of the conflict are introducing different variables that seem to serve distinct purposes, the resolution could involve including both sets of changes, ensuring that the resulting code is semantically correct and consistent with the surrounding context.

Here's the resolution:

```java
    // handle to the back-end
    transient private ExecutionEngine executionEngine;
   
    private String jobName = JOB_NAME_PREFIX;    // can be overwritten by users
  
    // Pig Script Output
    private String jobOutputFile = "";
    
    // JobConf of the currently executing Map-Reduce job
    JobConf jobConf;
    
    private Properties properties;
    
    /**
     * a table mapping function names to function specs.
     */
```

The resolved snippet in markdown code syntax as requested is:
```java
    // handle to the back-end
    transient private ExecutionEngine executionEngine;
   
    private String jobName = JOB_NAME_PREFIX;    // can be overwritten by users
  
    // Pig Script Output
    private String jobOutputFile = "";
    
    // JobConf of the currently executing Map-Reduce job
    JobConf jobConf;
    
    private Properties properties;
    
    /**
     * a table mapping function names to function specs.
     */
```
