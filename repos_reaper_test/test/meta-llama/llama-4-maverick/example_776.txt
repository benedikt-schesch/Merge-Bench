To resolve this merge conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The given code snippet appears to be part of a larger string that represents a list of commands or usage instructions for a database or data storage system, likely using HBase given the syntax and commands (e.g., `get`, `put`, `delete`, `scan`, `cas`). The conflict arises from the addition of a new command on the branch being merged into the main branch (`HEAD`).

The original code (`HEAD`) contains a list of commands without the line starting with "  mscan". The branch being merged (`d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`) adds a new command "  mscan" for a potentially multi-scan or more complex scan operation.

To resolve the conflict, we should consider whether the addition of "  mscan" is relevant and should be included in the merged version. Since "mscan" seems to be an additional feature or command that provides more functionality (perhaps related to scanning with more specific criteria or multiple scans), it's logical to include it in the merged version if the intent is to incorporate new features or commands from the branch.

Thus, the resolution involves deciding to include both the original commands and the new "mscan" command. The result should be a coherent and comprehensive list of available commands.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
                       + "  get <table> <key> [family] [qualifiers ...]\n"
                       + "  icv <table> <key> <family> <qualifier> [amount]\n"
                       + "  put <table> <key> <family> <qualifier> <value>\n"
                       + "  delete <table> <key> [<family> [<qualifier>]]\n"
                       + "  scan <table> [start] [family] [qualifier] [stop] [regexp]\n"
                       + "  mscan <table> [start] [family[:qualifier[,qualifier]]/[family...]] [stop] [regexp]\n"
                       + "  cas <table> <key> <family> <qualifier> <expected> <value>\n"
                       + "Variants that acquire an explicit row-lock:\n"
                       + "  lget <table> <key> [family] [qualifiers ...]\n"
                       + "  lput <table> <key> <family> <qualifier> <value>\n"
                       + "  ldelete <table> <key> <family> <qualifier>\n"
