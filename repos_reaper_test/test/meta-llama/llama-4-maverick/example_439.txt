To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes both sides are trying to introduce.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that represents some kind of entity or object, potentially in the context of a video or media management system given the presence of a `isWatched` flag. The class has getter and setter methods for its properties.

The conflict arises between the local changes (`HEAD`) and the changes being merged from another branch (`308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5`). The local changes (`HEAD`) end at the `setCreated` method, while the incoming changes introduce `isWatched` property's getter and setter methods.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent of both sides. The `HEAD` side has made changes that are not shown in the snippet but are presumably before or unrelated to the `isWatched` functionality. The incoming changes (`308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5`) are adding the capability to track whether something is watched.

Since the changes are not overlapping in terms of the methods they are modifying or introducing, and assuming both changes are valid and should be part of the final code, the resolution involves incorporating both sides' changes. The `HEAD` changes are already applied before the conflict, so we just need to ensure that the new methods (`isWatched` and its setter) are correctly integrated.

The resolved code should include both the existing `setCreated` method and the new `isWatched` and `setWatched` methods without removing any existing functionality. Given the provided snippet is already showing the `setCreated` method and the new methods, and there's no indication that `HEAD` has changes that conflict with the introduction of `isWatched` functionality, we can directly include the changes from both sides.

Here is the resolved code in markdown code syntax as requested:
```java
    }

    public void setCreated(long created) {
        this.created = created;
    }

    public boolean isWatched() {
        return isWatched;
    }

    public void setWatched(boolean isWatched) {
        this.isWatched = isWatched;
    }
}
```
