To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The given code snippet is in Java and represents a part of a class named `PageRestaurantServices` that extends `AbstractFacebookType`. This class seems to be part of a larger system that interacts with Facebook's API, given the presence of the `@Facebook` annotation on one of its fields.

The conflict arises from the difference in the `serialVersionUID` declaration between the two versions being merged.

1. The version from `HEAD` (the current branch being worked on) includes a declaration for `serialVersionUID` with a value of `1L`.
2. The incoming version (from the commit `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) does not have any `serialVersionUID` declaration.

The `serialVersionUID` is a unique identifier for a class, used during the serialization and deserialization process in Java. It is crucial for ensuring that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have the same version of the class.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both changes:

- The `HEAD` version explicitly defines `serialVersionUID`, which is a good practice for classes that implement `Serializable` (implied by the presence of `serialVersionUID`). This suggests that the class is intended to be serialized, and the developer has taken control of the versioning.
- The incoming version does not include `serialVersionUID`, which could imply either that it was not considered necessary or that it was simply not included.

Since `AbstractFacebookType` likely implements `Serializable` (given the context and the fact that `PageRestaurantServices` has a `serialVersionUID`), and the incoming change does not modify this field or indicate a change in the serialization version, the most straightforward resolution is to preserve the `serialVersionUID` declaration. This is because changing or removing `serialVersionUID` can lead to issues with serialization compatibility if not done carefully.

Therefore, the resolution is to keep the `serialVersionUID` as is, because it is a deliberate declaration that might be necessary for serialization purposes.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageRestaurantServices extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private Boolean catering;

```
