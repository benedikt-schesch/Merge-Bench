To resolve the given merge conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The conflict is in the line where a `GruntParser` object is instantiated. The version on the left side of the conflict (between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`) creates a `GruntParser` with a single argument, a `StringReader` object containing a script. The version on the right side (between `=======` and `>>>>>>>`) creates a `GruntParser` with two arguments: a `StringReader` object containing the same script, and an object referred to as `myPig`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the role of `myPig` and whether it is necessary or not. `GruntParser` is a class used for parsing Pig Latin scripts. The original code (left side of the conflict) uses a constructor that takes only a `Reader` object, suggesting it might be using a default or previously set context for parsing. The modified code (right side) introduces an additional argument, `myPig`, which likely represents a specific Pig context or configuration.

Without more context about what `myPig` represents or its significance, we must consider the general implications of both changes. If `myPig` is crucial for the correct functioning of `GruntParser` (for example, if it provides necessary configuration or context that affects how the script is parsed or executed), then the version on the right is likely the intended change. If `myPig` is not essential or its absence is handled elsewhere in the code, the original version might be sufficient.

Given the information and focusing on the intent and semantics, if we assume `myPig` adds a necessary context or configuration that is relevant to the parsing or execution of the Pig script, the resolution should include it. 

Here is the resolution in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "dump b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();

```
