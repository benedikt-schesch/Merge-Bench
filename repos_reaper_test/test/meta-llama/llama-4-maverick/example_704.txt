To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and intent behind the code changes on both sides of the conflict.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be defining a set of constants for dialog identifiers within an application, presumably an email or messaging application given the context clues like `DIALOG_COMPOSE`, `DIALOG_REPLYING`, etc.

On the left-hand side (HEAD), we have the addition of `static final int DIALOG_FIND = 32;`. This suggests that the local changes are introducing a new dialog identifier for a "find" functionality.

On the right-hand side (5b113d182581d1ed140bc7768a508344f19d7d6e), there are three new dialog identifiers introduced: `DIALOG_REPORT = 33;`, `DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK = 34;`, and `DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE = 35;`. These suggest functionalities related to reporting, handling thread clicks, and viewing profiles, respectively.

Both sides are introducing new dialog identifiers. The conflict arises because they are assigning values to these new identifiers starting from the same base value (`32`).

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to ensure that the introduced constants are assigned unique values. Here's how we can think about it:

1. The left-hand side introduces `DIALOG_FIND` with the value `32`.
2. The right-hand side introduces three new constants. To avoid conflicts, these should be assigned values sequentially starting from `32`, but since `32` is already taken by `DIALOG_FIND` from the left-hand side, we can start from `33`.

Thus, a semantically resolved version would be to keep `DIALOG_FIND = 32` from the left-hand side and then introduce the new constants from the right-hand side with subsequent values.

Here's the resolution:
```java
    static final int DIALOG_MESSAGE_CLICK = 25;
    static final int DIALOG_GOTO_PARENT = 28;
    static final int DIALOG_EDIT = 29;
    static final int DIALOG_DELETE = 30;
    static final int DIALOG_COMPOSE = 31;
    static final int DIALOG_FIND = 32;
    static final int DIALOG_REPORT = 33;
    static final int DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK = 34;
    static final int DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE = 35;

    // progress dialogs
    static final int DIALOG_LOGGING_IN = 1000;
    static final int DIALOG_SUBMITTING = 1004;
    static final int DIALOG_REPLYING = 1005;
```
The provided code snippet with the conflict resolved is returned in markdown code syntax as requested:
```java
    static final int DIALOG_MESSAGE_CLICK = 25;
    static final int DIALOG_GOTO_PARENT = 28;
    static final int DIALOG_EDIT = 29;
    static final int DIALOG_DELETE = 30;
    static final int DIALOG_COMPOSE = 31;
    static final int DIALOG_FIND = 32;
    static final int DIALOG_REPORT = 33;
    static final int DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK = 34;
    static final int DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE = 35;

    // progress dialogs
    static final int DIALOG_LOGGING_IN = 1000;
    static final int DIALOG_SUBMITTING = 1004;
    static final int DIALOG_REPLYING = 1005;
```
