To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a class that handles Bluetooth-related functionality, likely in an Android application given the presence of `BluetoothGattServer`. The variables declared suggest that the class is responsible for managing various callback contexts for different operations such as initialization, scanning, permissions, location services, and peripheral management.

On the left-hand side (`<<<<<<< HEAD`), we have a set of variables that include callback contexts for initialization (`initCallbackContext`), scanning (`scanCallbackContext`), permissions (`permissionsCallback`), and location (`locationCallback`). There's also a `scanLock` object for synchronization.

On the right-hand side (`>>>>>>> 2efc89dde2658f518e6b6ca936296c207e08d65c`), additional variables are introduced: `initPeripheralCallback`, `gattServer`, `addServiceCallback`, `advertiseCallbackContext`, and a boolean flag `isAdvertising`. These variables seem to be related to peripheral management and advertising.

The intent on both sides appears to be additive; that is, new variables are being introduced to presumably extend the functionality of the class. The left-hand side has variables related to the basic operations and synchronization, while the right-hand side adds variables related to more advanced or specific Bluetooth operations (e.g., peripheral initialization, GATT server management, service addition, and advertising).

Given that there's no overlap between the variables introduced on each side, the conflict can be resolved by simply combining all the variables.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
  private CallbackContext initCallbackContext;
  private CallbackContext scanCallbackContext;
  private Object scanLock = new Object();
  private CallbackContext permissionsCallback;
  private CallbackContext locationCallback;

  private CallbackContext initPeripheralCallback;
  private BluetoothGattServer gattServer;
  private CallbackContext addServiceCallback;
  private CallbackContext advertiseCallbackContext;
  private boolean isAdvertising = false;

  //Store connections and all their callbacks
  private HashMap<Object, HashMap<Object,Object>> connections;

  //Discovery related variables
```

The merge conflict is resolved by combining the changes from both sides. The code now includes all the variables from both versions, preserving the original intent and semantics.
