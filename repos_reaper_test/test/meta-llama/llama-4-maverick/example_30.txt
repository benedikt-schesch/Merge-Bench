To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that is used within the Spout API, a framework for building multiplayer games or other graphical applications. The snippet shows a list of import statements at the top of a Java file.

The conflict arises from two different commits (or branches) trying to modify the same section of the code. 

On one side (`HEAD`), there's an import statement for `org.spout.math.vector.Vector3`. 

On the other side (`cc0703054530b4eeda07a2b1b619ed34e1e7d201`), there's an import statement for `org.spout.api.Client`.

The rest of the import statements are not in conflict; they are present on both sides or are not relevant to the conflict.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both changes. 

1. The change on `HEAD` imports `Vector3`, suggesting that the class might be using this type for vector operations, possibly for entity positioning or other spatial calculations.
   
2. The change on `cc0703054530b4eeda07a2b1b619ed34e1e7d201` imports `Client`, which could be used for client-specific logic or interactions within the Spout API framework.

Since both imports are distinct and there's no indication that they are mutually exclusive or that one replaces the other, the most straightforward resolution is to include both import statements in the final merged code.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

import org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.HashCodeBuilder;

import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.Client;
import org.spout.api.Platform;
import org.spout.api.Spout;
import org.spout.api.component.BaseComponentOwner;
import org.spout.api.component.Component;
import org.spout.api.component.entity.EntityComponent;
