To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a method that adjusts the translation and visibility of a view based on certain conditions. The conflict arises from changes made in two different branches (HEAD and c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c).

Let's analyze the conflict:

```java
        float finalPos = getTranslationY() + distance;
        if (finalPos > 0) {
            finalPos = 0;
        }

<<<<<<< HEAD
        float finalPos = getTranslationY() + distance;
        if (finalPos > 0) finalPos = 0;

=======
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
        setTranslationY(finalPos);

        if (getAlpha() == 0.0f) {
            setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
            setAlpha(1.0f);
```

The conflicting section is between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c`. The code on both sides of the conflict is examined to understand the intent.

1. The code before the conflict calculates `finalPos` and ensures it does not exceed 0.
2. The conflicting lines under `HEAD` repeat the calculation of `finalPos` with the same condition but in a more concise form.
3. The code after the conflict (`setTranslationY(finalPos);` and the following lines) is not part of the conflict and is common in both versions.

The intent of both sides seems to be to calculate `finalPos` correctly and then proceed with setting the translation Y of a view. The repetition under `HEAD` is unnecessary and seems to be a redundant operation, as `finalPos` has already been calculated and adjusted before the conflict.

However, upon closer inspection, it's clear that both the original code and the code under `HEAD` achieve the same result: they calculate `finalPos` and cap it at 0. The version under `HEAD` simply does this with a slight variation in syntax (using a single-line if statement instead of a block).

The code on the other side of the conflict (under `c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c`) does not introduce any new changes within the conflicting section; it simply omits the redundant lines.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent and semantics, we should remove the redundant calculation. The correct resolution is to keep the initial calculation of `finalPos` and discard the redundant repetition.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
        float finalPos = getTranslationY() + distance;
        if (finalPos > 0) {
            finalPos = 0;
        }

        setTranslationY(finalPos);

        if (getAlpha() == 0.0f) {
            setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
            setAlpha(1.0f);
```
