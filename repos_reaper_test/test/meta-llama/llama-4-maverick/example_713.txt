To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a class that handles media playback, likely within an Android application given the use of `EventBus` and `MediaPlayer`. The `play()` method is overridden, suggesting it's part of an interface or abstract class related to media playback control.

On the `HEAD` side (typically representing the local branch being worked on), the `play()` method checks if a `MediaPlayer` associated with `mPreparedQuery` exists and is not currently playing. If so, it starts playing.

On the other side of the merge (`ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66`), the `play()` method sets `mPlayState` to `PlaybackStateCompat.STATE_PLAYING` and then calls `handlePlayState()`. This suggests a change in how the playback state is managed, potentially integrating with a more standardized state management system (like that used by `MediaSessionCompat`).

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand if these changes are complementary or if one is a refactoring that replaces the other. The `HEAD` side directly controls the `MediaPlayer`, while the other side seems to update a state variable and lets another method (`handlePlayState()`) presumably handle the actual playback control or state notification.

Without knowing the specifics of `handlePlayState()` and how `mPlayState` is used elsewhere, it's challenging to determine if setting `mPlayState` and calling `handlePlayState()` replaces or complements the direct `MediaPlayer` control. 

However, a reasonable merge might involve doing both: updating the playback state and then ensuring the `MediaPlayer` is started if it's not already playing. This assumes that `handlePlayState()` will either directly or indirectly cause the `MediaPlayer` to start playing if it's in a playing state.

Here's a potential resolution that combines both intents:

```java
        EventBus.getDefault().register(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void play() {
        mPlayState = PlaybackStateCompat.STATE_PLAYING;
        handlePlayState();
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null && !sMediaPlayer.isPlaying())
            sMediaPlayer.start();
    }

    @Override
    public void pause() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

However, the correct resolution depends on the specifics of the `handlePlayState()` method and the overall design of the media playback handling in the application. If `handlePlayState()` is designed to start the playback when the state is set to playing, the explicit call to `sMediaPlayer.start()` might be redundant.

Given the potential ambiguity and without further context on how `handlePlayState()` operates, the most conservative resolution would be to return the original snippet with the conflict, as altering it without clear understanding might introduce bugs.

```java
        EventBus.getDefault().register(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void play() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null && !sMediaPlayer.isPlaying())
            sMediaPlayer.start();
=======
        mPlayState = PlaybackStateCompat.STATE_PLAYING;
        handlePlayState();

    }

    @Override
    public void pause() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
