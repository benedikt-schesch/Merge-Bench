To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class, given the presence of `@Test` annotations. The specific test method we're looking at seems to be verifying the functionality of a `for` loop that iterates over a collection (`page`) and increments a counter for each `FacebookType` object in it. The assertion after the loop checks if the counter is equal to 18.

The merge conflict arises from the differing ways the assertion is made on either side of the merge:

- On the `HEAD` side, the assertion is made using `assertThat(counter).isEqualTo(18);`, which is a syntax typically associated with the AssertJ library. This library provides a fluent API for assertions.
  
- On the `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` side, the assertion is made using `assertEquals(18, counter);`, which is a syntax associated with JUnit's assertion methods.

Both assertions aim to verify that the value of `counter` is 18. The difference lies in the assertion library/method used.

To resolve this conflict, we need to determine if there's a preference or a standard within the project for which assertion library or method to use. Without additional context indicating a specific preference, we can choose one based on the semantics and intent.

Both assertions are semantically equivalent; they check if `counter` equals 18. Thus, we can resolve the conflict by choosing one that aligns with the project's conventions or by picking the one that is more commonly used or considered more readable.

Let's resolve the conflict by choosing the AssertJ style (`assertThat(counter).isEqualTo(18);`), as it is often considered more readable and fluent. However, without knowing the project's specific conventions, this is just one of the valid choices.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
      for (FacebookType type : page) {
        counter++;
      }
    }

    assertThat(counter).isEqualTo(18);
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_snapshot() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();
```
