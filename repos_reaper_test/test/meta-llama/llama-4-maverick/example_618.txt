To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes proposed by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class due to the presence of a method (`addCity`) and a field declaration (`locales`). The conflict revolves around the declaration and initialization of a field named `locales`.

### Analysis of the Conflict

- The left side of the conflict (`HEAD`) includes a declaration of a protected field `locales` of type `List<Integer>`, annotated with `@Facebook`. This suggests that the `locales` field is intended to store a list of integers representing locales, and the annotation might be related to data or configuration specific to Facebook.

- The right side of the conflict (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) is empty, indicating that this side of the merge does not include the declaration of the `locales` field. This could mean that either the field was removed or it was never present in this branch.

### Resolving the Conflict

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions.

1. **Understanding the Intent of `HEAD`**: The presence of `locales` in `HEAD` and its annotation with `@Facebook` suggests that this field is significant for Facebook-related functionality or configuration. Its type is `List<Integer>`, which might represent a list of locale identifiers.

2. **Understanding the Intent of `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`**: The absence of `locales` in this version could imply that the field is either not needed, has been moved elsewhere, or is no longer relevant.

Without additional context about why `locales` was added or removed, we must consider the semantics and potential impact of including or excluding this field.

### Decision

If we prioritize understanding the need for the `locales` field based on the available information:

- If the `locales` field is crucial for the functionality related to the `@Facebook` annotation and there's no indication that it's redundant or has been replaced, we should retain it.
- If the removal of `locales` in `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` signifies that it's no longer necessary or has been refactored elsewhere, we should remove it.

Given the information available and without further context on the intent behind the addition or removal of `locales`, the safest approach is to **preserve the conflict as is** because we cannot be certain which version is correct or intended by the developers.

Thus, the resolution is to return the snippet as provided, without modifications.

```java
          regions.add(mapper.toJavaObject(region, KeyedType.class));
        }
      }
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD

        return geoLocations.addCity(city);
      }
      return cities.add(city);
