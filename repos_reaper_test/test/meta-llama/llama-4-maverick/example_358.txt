To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The conflict is within the `parse` method of the `JsonHttpParser` class. 

The left-hand side (HEAD) of the conflict is:
```java
return Json.parseAndClose(JsonHttpParser.parserForResponse(response), dataClass, null);
```
The right-hand side (01a6cc54669b5ebf1ea1c3e27e424bba99a0ef3c) of the conflict is:
```java
return parserForResponse(jsonFactory, response).parseAndClose(dataClass, null);
```

Let's analyze both sides:

1. **Left-hand side (HEAD):**
   - It calls `JsonHttpParser.parserForResponse(response)` to get a parser.
   - It then calls `Json.parseAndClose` with the obtained parser, `dataClass`, and `null` as arguments.

2. **Right-hand side (01a6cc54669b5ebf1ea1c3e27e424bba99a0ef3c):**
   - It calls `parserForResponse(jsonFactory, response)` to get a parser. Note that this version explicitly requires a `jsonFactory`.
   - It then calls `parseAndClose` directly on the obtained parser with `dataClass` and `null` as arguments.

Upon closer inspection, both sides seem to be achieving a similar goal: parsing an HTTP response using a JSON parser obtained from a method named `parserForResponse`. The key differences are:
- The left-hand side uses `Json.parseAndClose`, while the right-hand side calls `parseAndClose` directly on the parser object.
- The right-hand side explicitly passes `jsonFactory` to `parserForResponse`, whereas the left-hand side does not.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the changes implied by both sides and determine the most appropriate or intended functionality.

Given the context that both versions are essentially trying to parse an HTTP response into a specified data class, and without more information about the surrounding code changes or the intent behind the `jsonFactory` parameter, a straightforward resolution would be to choose the version that is more explicit and potentially more flexible or modern (often the case with the right-hand side in merge conflicts, as it might represent a more recent change).

However, the best resolution depends on understanding whether `jsonFactory` is necessary and available in the context, and whether the direct call to `parseAndClose` on the parser object is the intended behavior.

Let's directly return the entire snippet with the conflict as is, since we can't be certain about the intent without more context.

```java
  public final String getContentType() {
    return contentType;
  }

  public <T> T parse(HttpResponse response, Class<T> dataClass) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD:google-api-client/src/com/google/api/client/json/JsonHttpParser.java
    return Json.parseAndClose(JsonHttpParser.parserForResponse(response), dataClass, null);
