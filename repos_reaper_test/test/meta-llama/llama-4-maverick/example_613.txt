To resolve the given merge conflict, we need to understand the context and intent of the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The given snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a test class, likely using JUnit for assertions. It is testing an `exampleRating` object that contains `comments` and `likes`. The assertions verify various properties of these objects, such as their existence, order, total count, and the ability to comment or like.

The conflict arises from the lines:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertTrue(comments.getCanComment());
=======
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
```
Here, the local version (`HEAD`) includes an assertion that `comments.getCanComment()` is `true`, while the version being merged (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) does not have this assertion (or any other change in this snippet).

To resolve this conflict, we must understand the intent behind both versions. The local version (`HEAD`) is checking if commenting is allowed, suggesting that this capability is expected. The other version does not include this check, possibly because it either doesn't care about this specific capability or it's tested elsewhere.

Since there's no additional context or changes on the other side of the merge within this snippet, and assuming that both versions are otherwise correct in their own right, we can infer that the conflict is about whether or not to include the check for `comments.getCanComment()`.

Given that the check is present in `HEAD` and not in the other version, and without further context suggesting that this check is redundant or incorrect, the most straightforward resolution is to include the check if it's deemed necessary by the test's intent.

Therefore, the resolution involves deciding whether the assertion for `comments.getCanComment()` is necessary. If it is, the conflict is resolved by keeping the assertion. If not, it is resolved by removing it.

Let's resolve it by keeping the assertion as it seems to be an important check for the functionality being tested.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java

    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getComments());
    Comments comments = exampleRating.getComments();
    assertEquals("chronological", comments.getOrder());
    assertEquals(1L, comments.getTotalCount().longValue());
    assertTrue(comments.getCanComment());

    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getLikes());
    Likes likes = exampleRating.getLikes();
    assertEquals(0L, likes.getTotalCount().longValue());
    assertTrue(likes.getCanLike());

```
