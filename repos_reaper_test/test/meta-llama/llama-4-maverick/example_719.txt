To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The given Java code snippet is defining several public static final Patterns and integers related to text processing, likely for a Twitter-like application given the context of screen names, hashtags, and auto-linking.

The conflict arises between two commits (or branches): `HEAD` (the current branch) and `b83625b0ee263ecfe1fa0ceea3439cfcbf843606` (the other branch being merged into `HEAD`).

1. The `HEAD` branch contains the following definitions:
   - `SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END`
   - `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS` with a specific regular expression pattern that includes `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE | Pattern.UNICODE_CASE`.
   
2. The `b83625b0ee263ecfe1fa0ceea3439cfcbf843606` branch modifies `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS` by changing its regular expression slightly and removes `Pattern.UNICODE_CASE`, leaving only `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE`. It also does not include the definition of `SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both changes.

- `SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END` in `HEAD` is used somewhere else in the codebase (not shown in the snippet), and its presence does not directly conflict with the changes made in the other branch regarding `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS`.

- The change in `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS` between the two branches is two-fold:
  - The first part of the regex is modified from `([^&/" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS + "])(#|\uFF03)` to `([^&/" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS + "]+)(#|\uFF03)`, effectively changing the match from a single character that is not in `HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS` to one or more such characters. This could be seen as an improvement or a necessary change depending on the requirements of the application.
  - The flags used for compiling the pattern are changed from `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE | Pattern.UNICODE_CASE` to just `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE`, potentially affecting how case-insensitive matching is performed, especially with Unicode characters.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent of both sides:

1. We should keep `SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END` as it is because it's not conflicting directly with the changes from the other branch.
2. For `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS`, we need to decide whether to keep the regex pattern and the flags as they are in `HEAD`, change them to what's in the other branch, or find a middle ground.

Given the information and without further context on the requirements or the effects of these changes, a straightforward resolution is to keep the changes from both sides where they do not conflict directly. Thus, we could include both `SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END` from `HEAD` and the modified `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS` from the other branch.

Here's the merged version:

```java
  /* Begin public constants */
  public static final Pattern AT_SIGNS = Pattern.compile("[" + AT_SIGNS_CHARS + "]");

  public static final Pattern SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END = Pattern.compile("^(?:[" + AT_SIGNS_CHARS + LATIN_ACCENTS_CHARS + "]|://)");

  public static final Pattern AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS = Pattern.compile("(^|[^&/" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS + "]+)(#|\uFF03)(" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*" + HASHTAG_ALPHA + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*)", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_BEFORE = 1;
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_HASH = 2;
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_TAG = 3;
  public static final Pattern HASHTAG_MATCH_END = Pattern.compile("^(?:[#＃]|://)");
```

However, the removal of `Pattern.UNICODE_CASE` in the other branch might be intentional for performance or compatibility reasons, and mixing it with the `HEAD` version could potentially lead to issues if not tested thoroughly.

Since the intent is to preserve both changes and assuming that both are necessary and tested, the above resolution seems reasonable. 

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:
```java
  /* Begin public constants */
  public static final Pattern AT_SIGNS = Pattern.compile("[" + AT_SIGNS_CHARS + "]");

  public static final Pattern SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END = Pattern.compile("^(?:[" + AT_SIGNS_CHARS + LATIN_ACCENTS_CHARS + "]|://)");

  public static final Pattern AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS = Pattern.compile("(^|[^&/" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS + "]+)(#|\uFF03)(" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*" + HASHTAG_ALPHA + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*)", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_BEFORE = 1;
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_HASH = 2;
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_TAG = 3;
  public static final Pattern HASHTAG_MATCH_END = Pattern.compile("^(?:[#＃]|://)");
