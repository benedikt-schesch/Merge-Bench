To resolve the given merge conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The conflict is in the following lines of code:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTexture);
=======
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
```
The code on both sides of the conflict is loading a texture using `this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture()`. The difference lies in the texture object being loaded: `this.mBitmapTexture` on the left side (HEAD) and `this.mBitmapTextureAtlas` on the right side.

The variable names `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas` suggest that they might be related to loading a bitmap as a texture, with the latter possibly indicating it's part of or related to a texture atlas. 

Without additional context about what these variables represent or the specific requirements of the code, we can still infer some possible reasons for the conflict:

1. **Renaming or Refactoring**: One possibility is that `mBitmapTexture` was renamed or refactored to `mBitmapTextureAtlas` in one branch to better reflect its purpose or to indicate it's associated with a texture atlas.

2. **Different Implementations or Features**: Another possibility is that the two branches introduced different textures or handled texture loading differently.

To resolve the conflict, we should consider the intent behind the changes:

- If `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas` serve the same purpose or represent the same resource (with the latter being a renaming or more specific naming), and there's no other dependency or initialization issue, we should choose the version that is more appropriate or consistent with the rest of the codebase.

- If they are different and both are needed for different reasons (e.g., one branch introduced a new feature that requires a texture atlas), then we might need to ensure both are properly loaded or handled.

Given the information provided and focusing on the semantics and intent:

Since `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas` are likely representing different variables (one being possibly a typo, misinterpretation, or a different concept than the other), and without further context that they are the same or one is an updated version of the other, the most straightforward resolution isn't clear.

However, a common resolution when dealing with such conflicts, if both changes are deemed necessary or if it's unclear which one is correct, is to examine if both `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas` are valid and needed.

Let's assume that there was a renaming or a change in how the texture is represented or loaded, and `mBitmapTextureAtlas` is the updated or correct version to use. 

The original snippet is:
```java
					ModPlayerExample.this.startPlayingMod();
				}
			});
		}

<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTexture);
=======
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```
To return the entire snippet with the conflict resolved or preserved as per the instructions:

If we decide to resolve it by choosing one side (for example, `mBitmapTextureAtlas` as it might be a more specific or updated version), the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax would be:
```java
					ModPlayerExample.this.startPlayingMod();
				}
			});
		}

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```
However, if we are not sure, we should return the original snippet with the conflict:
```java
					ModPlayerExample.this.startPlayingMod();
				}
			});
		}

<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTexture);
=======
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```
