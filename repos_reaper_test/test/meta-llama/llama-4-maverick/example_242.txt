To resolve the merge conflict in the given code snippet, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a larger system that involves data processing or compilation, given the presence of a `MessageCollector` and properties related to a `PigConfiguration`. The conflict arises in the retrieval of a property named "last.input.chunksize" from a properties object (`pc.getProperties()`), where the default value is set differently on the two branches of the merge.

On the `HEAD` branch (the local branch), the default value for "last.input.chunksize" is `JoinPackager.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE`.

On the other branch (`1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81`), the default value is `POJoinPackage.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the use of "last.input.chunksize" and the significance of the default values on both branches.

1. **Understanding the Intent**: The property "last.input.chunksize" suggests that it is related to the size of chunks used in some input processing. The default value is used if this property is not explicitly set.

2. **Analyzing the Default Values**:
   - `JoinPackager.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE` is used on the `HEAD` branch.
   - `POJoinPackage.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE` is used on the other branch.

The change from `JoinPackager` to `POJoinPackage` suggests a potential renaming or refactoring of a class related to packaging or handling input data in chunks. `POJoinPackage` seems to be a more specific or updated class name compared to `JoinPackager`, possibly indicating a change in the implementation or the specific type of packaging being referred to.

Given this context, if `POJoinPackage` is the updated or correct class to use (assuming the commit message or other context supports this), and there's no indication that `JoinPackager` is still relevant or preferred, the resolution would lean towards using `POJoinPackage.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE`.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java

        //display the warning message(s) from the MRCompiler
        comp.getMessageCollector().logMessages(MessageType.Warning, aggregateWarning, log);

        String lastInputChunkSize =
                pc.getProperties().getProperty(
                        "last.input.chunksize", POJoinPackage.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE);

        String prop = pc.getProperties().getProperty(PigConfiguration.PROP_NO_COMBINER);
        if (!pc.inIllustrator && !("true".equals(prop)))  {
            boolean doMapAgg =
                    Boolean.valueOf(pc.getProperties().getProperty(PigConfiguration.PROP_EXEC_MAP_PARTAGG,"false"));
```
