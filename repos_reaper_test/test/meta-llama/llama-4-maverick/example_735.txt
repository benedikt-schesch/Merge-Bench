To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a larger application that interacts with the camera hardware on an Android device. The specific section of code is concerned with calculating the rotation of the camera preview based on the device's orientation and the camera's characteristics.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The comment above the code indicates that the display is kept at 90 degrees, and the task is to rotate the pictures accordingly. This implies that the application is designed to handle camera operations in a specific orientation, likely a landscape or portrait mode where the display orientation is fixed or managed.

2. **Analyzing the Conflict**:
   - The left-hand side (HEAD) of the merge conflict introduces a line of code: `orientation = (orientation + 45) / 90 * 90;`. This line adjusts the `orientation` value by adding 45 degrees, then rounding it to the nearest 90-degree increment. This is a common technique to achieve a form of "snapping" to the nearest orientation (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees).
   - The right-hand side (c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c) comments out a line of code that seems to be related to adjusting the `orientation`. The commented line is `//orientation = (360 - orientation + 45) / 90 * 90;`. This suggests an alternative way of handling the orientation adjustment, potentially to account for a different reference frame or to invert the orientation calculation.

3. **Resolving the Conflict**:
   - To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. The left-hand side (HEAD) actively adjusts the `orientation` to the nearest 90-degree boundary after adding 45 degrees, effectively rounding it. The right-hand side, by commenting out its adjustment, either retains a previous or different method of handling `orientation` or suggests that the adjustment should not be applied directly in this manner.
   - The code on the right-hand side is commented out, suggesting it might not be directly relevant or is a change that hasn't been finalized or decided upon.

Given the information and focusing on the semantics and intent:
- The left-hand side directly modifies `orientation`, which could imply that this adjustment is necessary for the camera's operation or preview rotation calculation.
- The right-hand side's change is commented out, indicating it may not be the preferred or final solution.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent and semantics, one would ideally choose the change that aligns with the application's requirements and the developers' intent. However, without additional context on why one or both of these changes were made, the safest resolution might be to preserve both pieces of information.

Here is the resolution:
```java

        // Rotate the pictures accordingly (display is kept at 90 degrees)
        Camera.CameraInfo info =
                new android.hardware.Camera.CameraInfo();
        Camera.getCameraInfo(mCurrentFacing, info);
        int rotation = 0;
        if (info.facing == Camera.CameraInfo.CAMERA_FACING_FRONT) {
            rotation = (info.orientation - ((orientation + 45) / 90 * 90) + 360) % 360;
        } else {  // back-facing camera
            rotation = (info.orientation + ((orientation + 45) / 90 * 90)) % 360;
```
However, upon closer inspection, it seems more appropriate to directly return the original snippet with the conflict as the resolution isn't straightforward without understanding the exact intent behind the alternative orientation adjustment on the right-hand side.

Thus, the response should be:
```java

        // Rotate the pictures accordingly (display is kept at 90 degrees)
        Camera.CameraInfo info =
                new android.hardware.Camera.CameraInfo();
        Camera.getCameraInfo(mCurrentFacing, info);
<<<<<<< HEAD
        orientation = (orientation + 45) / 90 * 90;
=======
        //orientation = (360 - orientation + 45) / 90 * 90;
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
        int rotation = 0;
        if (info.facing == Camera.CameraInfo.CAMERA_FACING_FRONT) {
            rotation = (info.orientation - orientation + 360) % 360;
        } else {  // back-facing camera
            rotation = (info.orientation + orientation) % 360;
```
