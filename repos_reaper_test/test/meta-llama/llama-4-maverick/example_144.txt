To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The snippet provided is a Java import statement section. The conflict arises between the local changes (represented by `HEAD`) and the changes from the commit `0ae7f1d024767140d97e8f17fbf35dec14a4b384`.

On the `HEAD` side, the import statement for `java.io.OutputStream` is present. On the other side (`0ae7f1d024767140d97e8f17fbf35dec14a4b384`), this import statement is removed.

Let's analyze the intent:
- The presence of `java.io.OutputStream` on the `HEAD` side suggests that it is being used somewhere in the code for output operations, possibly related to writing to streams.
- The removal of `java.io.OutputStream` on the other side could imply that the code no longer needs this import, possibly because the related functionality has been refactored or removed.

Without the actual code that uses these imports, we can only speculate on the intent. However, a semantic merge conflict resolution involves understanding whether both changes can coexist or if one is redundant.

Given the information:
1. The import for `java.io.OutputStream` is explicitly included on one side and removed on the other.
2. There's no clear indication that the removal of `java.io.OutputStream` on the `0ae7f1d024767140d97e8f17fbf35dec14a4b384` side is due to a refactor that makes it unnecessary.

To resolve this, we need to see if `OutputStream` is used in the code. If it's used, removing the import would cause a compilation error. If it's not used, the import is redundant.

Since we cannot view the rest of the code and assuming the conflict is solely based on the import statements, a cautious approach is to preserve the conflict as is because we cannot be certain of the intent without more context.

However, following the task instructions to return the entire snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context, the output will be the same as the input because we are not resolving the conflict due to lack of clear intent.
