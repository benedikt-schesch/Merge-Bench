To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a dependency injection module, likely using Dagger, given the `@Provides` and `@PerActivity` annotations. The method in conflict is related to providing a use case or repository for changing the star status of a repository, presumably in the context of a GitHub client application or similar.

The conflict arises between two versions of a method:
1. `ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase provideChangeRepositoryStarRepository()`
2. `ChangeRepositoryStarRepository provideChangeRepositoryStarRepository()`

The difference lies in the return type and the type of object being instantiated. 

- The left-hand side (`HEAD`) returns a `ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase`, suggesting that the focus is on the use case aspect of changing a repository's star status.
- The right-hand side (`46751d2846d926dab116569835f3660a6297da86`) returns a `ChangeRepositoryStarRepository`, indicating a focus on the repository layer for this functionality.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. 

1. **Analyzing the Names**: The names `ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase` and `ChangeRepositoryStarRepository` suggest different layers or purposes within the application. `UseCase` typically refers to an application-specific business logic, while `Repository` refers to the data access layer.

2. **Dependency Injection Context**: Both are being provided by the same method name `provideChangeRepositoryStarRepository`, suggesting they are intended to serve a similar purpose or fulfill a similar dependency within the application.

3. **Potential for Different Intent**: If `ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase` encapsulates business logic related to starring a repository (potentially including the repository layer interaction), and `ChangeRepositoryStarRepository` directly represents the data access or repository layer for this action, they serve different purposes.

Without additional context about how these are used within the application or the specific design principles being followed (e.g., Clean Architecture, where `UseCase` and `Repository` are distinct concepts), the intent behind both changes seems to be providing a dependency for handling the starring of a repository.

However, they cannot both be correct if they are being provided under the same method name and annotation, as this would lead to a duplicate method error in the context of Dagger or similar frameworks.

Given the information and sticking strictly to the task:

```java
    return new GenericRepository<>(null, api);
  }

  @Provides
  @PerActivity
<<<<<<< HEAD
  ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase provideChangeRepositoryStarRepository() {
    return new ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase();
=======
  ChangeRepositoryStarRepository provideChangeRepositoryStarRepository() {
    return new ChangeRepositoryStarRepository();
>>>>>>> 46751d2846d926dab116569835f3660a6297da86
  }

  @Provides
  @PerActivity
```
