To resolve the given merge conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The conflict is about the import statement for `VertexBufferObjectManager`. The `HEAD` side does not have this import, while the other side (`e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885`) includes it.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. The import statement is added on the other side (`e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885`), indicating that somewhere in the code (not shown in this snippet), `VertexBufferObjectManager` is being used.
2. The `HEAD` side does not have this import, suggesting that either `VertexBufferObjectManager` is not used in the code on this side or it's not necessary due to other changes or imports.

Given the context that we're dealing with AndEngine, a Java framework for creating Android games, `VertexBufferObjectManager` is a crucial class for managing vertex buffer objects. Its import is necessary if the code is using it for rendering or other graphical operations.

Since the snippet provided does not include the actual usage of `VertexBufferObjectManager`, we have to infer based on the import statement alone.

To resolve the conflict, we should consider whether the code on the `HEAD` side uses `VertexBufferObjectManager`. If it does, then the import statement is necessary and should be kept. If not, then the import might be unnecessary and could potentially be removed.

However, without seeing the actual code that uses or doesn't use `VertexBufferObjectManager`, the safest approach is to include the import statement to avoid potential compilation issues if it's used later in the code not shown here.

Thus, the resolution involves including the import statement for `VertexBufferObjectManager` as it's likely necessary for the functionality intended on the other side of the merge.
