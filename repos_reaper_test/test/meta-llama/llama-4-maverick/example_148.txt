To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a larger system, possibly Apache Pig, given the class and method names. The conflict arises between two versions of code: one from the local branch (`HEAD`) and the other from a commit (`2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea`) being merged into it.

The conflict is within a block of code where `PigStats` and `ScriptState` are being initialized or started based on certain conditions. The local branch (`HEAD`) contains a comment explaining that `ScriptState` should not be overwritten if it has already been initialized, presumably in a `Main` class or method.

The incoming change from the commit (`2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea`) seems to remove the comment present in the local branch.

Let's analyze the intent:
1. The local branch (`HEAD`) has a comment that provides context about why `ScriptState` is being checked for `null` before initialization. It suggests that `ScriptState` might have been initialized elsewhere (in `Main`), and thus, it should not be overwritten.
2. The incoming change removes this comment.

To resolve the conflict, we must consider whether the comment is still relevant or necessary. The code following the conflict checks if `ScriptState.get()` is `null` before initializing it, which is a good practice to avoid overwriting an already initialized state. The comment explains this reasoning, enhancing code readability and understandability.

Given that the code logic on both sides of the conflict (regarding the `if (ScriptState.get() == null)` check and the initialization of `ScriptState`) is essentially the same, and the only difference is the presence or absence of a comment, we should consider preserving the comment for clarity.

However, the incoming change (`2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea`) removes the comment. If we choose to resolve by accepting the incoming change, we remove the comment. But, it's worth noting that the comment provides useful context.

Let's preserve the original context and the comment for better understanding, but since the change is just about removing a comment, and there's no functional change intended by the merge, we can simply accept the version that keeps the comment for clarity, or understand it as a minor adjustment in code readability.

However, to directly resolve the given conflict without altering the original context or spacing, we directly take the necessary parts from both versions.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java

        addJarsFromProperties();
        markPredeployedJarsFromProperties();

        PigStats.start(pigContext.getExecutionEngine().instantiatePigStats());

        if (ScriptState.get() == null) {
            // If Pig was started via command line, ScriptState should have been
            // already initialized in Main. If so, we should not overwrite it.
            ScriptState.start(pigContext.getExecutionEngine().instantiateScriptState());
        }

```
