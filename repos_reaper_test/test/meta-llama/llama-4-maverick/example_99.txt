```java

  protected ByteAssert(Byte actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ByteAssert.class, description);
  }

  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```
The conflict was due to differing formatting between the two versions being merged. The version on the left side of the conflict (HEAD) was missing a space before the opening bracket of the `isEqualTo` method, while the version on the right side included it. To resolve this conflict, I've chosen to adopt the version with the space before the opening bracket, as it follows conventional Java coding standards for spacing. The resulting code is syntactically and semantically equivalent but with standardized formatting.
