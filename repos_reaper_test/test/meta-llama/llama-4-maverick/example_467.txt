To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.


### Analysis of the Merge Conflict

The conflict arises in the `startTomcat` method with different parameters. Let's break down the changes on both sides.


#### Left Side (HEAD)

The left side introduces a new `startTomcat` method that takes `port`, `jvmRoute`, and `loginType` as parameters. It calls `getTestUtils().createCatalina` to create a Tomcat instance.


#### Right Side (6c5fb5474dc66d5ab104a5546f43f05b75a4aaa2)

The right side also defines a `startTomcat` method but with different parameters: `port`, `sessionAffinityMode`, `jvmRoute`, and `loginType`. It directly calls `createCatalina` (not via `getTestUtils()`) to create a Tomcat instance and then configures the manager's stickiness based on `sessionAffinityMode`.


### Resolving the Conflict

The left side seems to be missing the configuration of the manager's stickiness, which is present on the right side. The right side has an additional parameter `sessionAffinityMode` that is used to determine the stickiness.

To resolve the conflict, we need to reconcile these differences. The method signature on the right side is more comprehensive as it includes `sessionAffinityMode`, which is used to configure the Tomcat instance's behavior.


### Solution

We will modify the code to incorporate the changes from both sides in a semantically correct manner.


```java

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        return startTomcat( port, SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, jvmRoute, null );
    }

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final SessionAffinityMode sessionAffinityMode,
            final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        final Embedded tomcat = getTestUtils().createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );
        tomcat.start();
        getManager( tomcat ).setSticky( sessionAffinityMode.isSticky() );
        return tomcat;
    }


```

In this resolution:


1. We adopted the method signature from the right side (`startTomcat` with `port`, `sessionAffinityMode`, `jvmRoute`, and `loginType`) as it is more comprehensive.
2. We changed `createCatalina` to `getTestUtils().createCatalina` to align with the left side's implementation, assuming that `getTestUtils()` is necessary for creating the Catalina instance.
3. The rest of the method remains as in the right side, configuring the Tomcat instance and its manager correctly.


### Returned Snippet

```java

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final String jvmRoute ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        return startTomcat( port, SessionAffinityMode.STICKY, jvmRoute, null );
    }

    private Embedded startTomcat( final int port, final SessionAffinityMode sessionAffinityMode,
            final String jvmRoute, final LoginType loginType ) throws MalformedURLException, UnknownHostException, LifecycleException {
        final Embedded tomcat = getTestUtils().createCatalina( port, MEMCACHED_NODES, jvmRoute, loginType );
        tomcat.start();
        getManager( tomcat ).setSticky( sessionAffinityMode.isSticky() );
        return tomcat;
    }
