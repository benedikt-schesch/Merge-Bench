To resolve the merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The given code snippet is in Java and includes import statements for various classes and interfaces from the `org.structr` package and Java standard library. The conflict arises from the fact that the local version (`HEAD`) and the version being merged (`1fc925c0741b0f6d64564077e1ac747e1c0b6407`) have differing import statements.

The local version (`HEAD`) includes additional import statements:
```java
import java.net.URI;
import java.util.Map;

import static org.structr.rest.common.HttpHelper.getAsStream;
```
These imports suggest that the local version is using `URI`, `Map`, and the static method `getAsStream` from `HttpHelper`.

The version being merged (`1fc925c0741b0f6d64564077e1ac747e1c0b6407`) does not include these import statements, indicating it might not be using `URI` and `Map` directly, or it might be importing them elsewhere, and it definitely is not using `getAsStream` from `HttpHelper` in a way that requires a static import here.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider whether the imports from `HEAD` are necessary and if their absence in `1fc925c0741b0f6d64564077e1ac747e1c0b6407` is due to not needing them or if they are imported elsewhere.

Since the intent is to merge the changes, we should keep the imports that are present in `HEAD` if they are used in the code (not shown in the snippet). Assuming the code that uses these imports exists and is valid, we should resolve the conflict by keeping the imports from `HEAD`.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
import org.structr.core.property.Property;
import org.structr.core.property.StringProperty;
import org.structr.rest.common.HttpHelper;

import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.URI;
import java.util.Map;

import static org.structr.rest.common.HttpHelper.getAsStream;
