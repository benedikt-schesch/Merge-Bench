To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The original code snippet appears to be part of a class, likely named `CSSURLEmbedder`, given the constructor name. The class seems to be involved in handling CSS URLs and has properties such as `options`, `maxUriLength`, and `maxImageSize`.

The conflict arises because there are two different versions of a constructor for `CSSURLEmbedder`:

1. The first version (before `<<<<<<< HEAD`) initializes `options`, `maxUriLength`, and `maxImageSize`.
2. The conflicting version (between `=======` and `>>>>>>> 790b69a0bd40e3ab536f9c6568748f981b3d525e`) introduces a new constructor that takes `Reader in`, `int options`, `boolean verbose`, and `int maxUriLength` as parameters. It initializes `code` by reading from `in`, sets `verbose`, `options`, and `maxUriLength`.

The intent of the first version seems to be initializing certain properties of the `CSSURLEmbedder` object. The new constructor introduced in the conflicting version not only initializes some of these properties but also reads code from a `Reader` and sets a `verbose` flag, suggesting it might be used for a different or more specific initialization scenario.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider whether both constructors serve distinct purposes and are needed. If they are, we should ensure that both are preserved. If not, we need to decide which one aligns better with the overall intent of the class.

Given that the new constructor introduces additional functionality (reading code from a `Reader` and setting `verbose`), and assuming this is a meaningful addition, we can resolve the conflict by keeping both constructors. The resulting code should include the new constructor as it seems to offer a different way of initializing a `CSSURLEmbedder` object.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
        this.options = options;
        this.maxUriLength = maxUriLength;
        this.maxImageSize = maxImageSize;
    }

    public CSSURLEmbedder(Reader in, int options, boolean verbose, int maxUriLength) throws IOException {
        this.code = readCode(in);
        this.verbose = verbose;
        this.options = options;
        this.maxUriLength = maxUriLength;
    }

    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Get/Set verbose flag
    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    
    public boolean getVerbose(){
```
