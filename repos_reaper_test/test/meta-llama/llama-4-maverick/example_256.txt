To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is from a `PigServer` constructor in Java, which is part of Apache Pig, a high-level data processing language and framework. The constructor takes a `PigContext` and a boolean `connect` as parameters. The conflict arises in the initialization of a field named `isMultiQuery`.

Let's analyze the conflict:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
        isMultiQuery = "true".equalsIgnoreCase(pigContext.getProperties()
                .getProperty(PigConfiguration.OPT_MULTIQUERY, "true"));
=======
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a
```

The left-hand side (HEAD) initializes `isMultiQuery` based on a property from `pigContext.getProperties()` with a default value of `"true"` if the property is not found. The property in question is related to whether multi-query optimization is enabled.

The right-hand side (88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a) does not initialize `isMultiQuery` explicitly; it simply removes the line.

To resolve this, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. The left-hand side (HEAD) suggests that the initialization of `isMultiQuery` is based on a configuration property with a sensible default (`"true"`). The right-hand side implies either that `isMultiQuery` is initialized elsewhere, or its initialization is not necessary at this point, or it is being handled differently.

However, without additional context (like where `isMultiQuery` is declared or if there's another initialization), we can only assume that the removal of this line might be intended to either avoid overriding a previous initialization or to change the logic of how `isMultiQuery` is set.

Since we cannot see the declaration of `isMultiQuery` or its usage elsewhere in the code, and assuming it's not initialized elsewhere, removing the initialization might lead to a different default value (e.g., `false` if it's a boolean) or a compiler error if it's not initialized.

Given the provided information, the safest resolution based on semantic intent would be to preserve the initialization logic if it was recently added or modified (as indicated by being on the HEAD side) unless there's a clear indication that it should be removed or changed.

However, since the exact intent (whether `isMultiQuery` should be initialized here or not) isn't clear without more context, and given the constraint that we should return the snippet as is if the intent is ambiguous, the resolution should be approached with caution.

Here is the original snippet returned in markdown code syntax, unchanged:

```java
    public PigServer(PigContext context, boolean connect) throws ExecException {
        this.pigContext = context;
        currDAG = new Graph(false);

        aggregateWarning = "true".equalsIgnoreCase(pigContext.getProperties().getProperty("aggregate.warning"));
<<<<<<< HEAD
        isMultiQuery = "true".equalsIgnoreCase(pigContext.getProperties()
                .getProperty(PigConfiguration.OPT_MULTIQUERY, "true"));
=======
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a

        jobName = pigContext.getProperties().getProperty(
                PigContext.JOB_NAME,
                PigContext.JOB_NAME_PREFIX + ":DefaultJobName");
