To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the changes introduced by both sides.

The original code before the merge conflict is not entirely visible, but we can infer from the provided snippet that there's a method `measureUser` that is being modified. 

The `HEAD` version (the local version) of `measureUser` takes three parameters: `TestUser user`, `ResultList recommendations`, and `Context context`. It uses `context.recommender` and `user` to select good items.

The version from `ae1b395ec63b1333c717fdac150e0860cf0326e0` (the version being merged) modifies `measureUser` to take four parameters: `TestUser user`, `int targetLength`, `ResultList recommendations`, and `Context context`. It removes the use of `context.recommender` when selecting good items, directly using `user` instead.

To resolve this conflict, we must understand the intent behind both changes. The change in `HEAD` does not introduce any new parameters but uses `context.recommender` and `user` for selecting good items. The change from `ae1b395ec63b1333c717fdac150e0860cf0326e0` introduces a new parameter `targetLength` and simplifies the selection of good items by removing `context.recommender`.

The introduction of `targetLength` in the merged version suggests that it might be intended for future use or is part of a new feature. However, within the provided snippet, `targetLength` is not used.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent of both changes, we should consider whether `targetLength` is necessary and whether the simplification of `goodItems.selectItems` is desired.

Since `targetLength` is not used within the provided snippet and its purpose is not clear from the given context, and assuming that the removal of `context.recommender` is a valid change (as it simplifies the method call and potentially aligns with other parts of the codebase or a refactoring effort), a semantically resolved version could incorporate both the new parameter and the simplified `goodItems.selectItems` call.

However, without more context on how `targetLength` is intended to be used or if it's part of a larger feature, directly using it or removing it becomes speculative.

Let's directly resolve it by incorporating the changes, assuming that `targetLength` is part of a valid change, even though it's not used.

```java
        return new AggregateResult(context).withSuffix(suffix);
    }

    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public MetricResult measureUser(TestUser user, int targetLength, ResultList recommendations, Context context) {
        LongSet good = goodItems.selectItems(context.universe, user);
        if (good.isEmpty()) {
            logger.warn("no good items for user {}", user.getUserId());
        }

        Integer rank = null;
```
