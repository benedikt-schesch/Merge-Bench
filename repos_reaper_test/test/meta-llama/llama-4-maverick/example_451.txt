To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the code snippet and understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a part of a Java method `printOption` which appears to be responsible for printing information about an `OptionHandler`. The method takes several parameters: `out` (a `PrintWriter`), `handler` (an `OptionHandler`), `len` (an `int` representing the maximum length of a metadata column), and `rb` (a `ResourceBundle` for internationalization).

On the left side of the merge conflict (HEAD), the method is declared as `protected void printOption(PrintWriter out, OptionHandler handler, int len, ResourceBundle rb)`. It does not have a filter parameter.

On the right side of the merge conflict (1acff436c29ed9c0f9ce81ad845b3df7480dde83), the method is declared as `private void printOption(PrintWriter out, OptionHandler handler, int len, ResourceBundle rb, OptionHandlerFilter filter)`. The access modifier has changed to `private`, and an additional parameter `filter` of type `OptionHandlerFilter` has been added.

The method body on the right side includes a condition `!filter.select(handler)` which is not present on the left side due to the absence of the `filter` parameter.

To resolve this conflict, we must consider the intent behind both versions. The left side keeps the method `protected` and does not include filtering, suggesting it is intended for broader use within the class hierarchy without filtering options. The right side changes the method to `private`, indicating it is intended for internal use within the class, and adds filtering functionality.

Since the method body is only provided for the right side, and it includes the `filter` parameter which is not present on the left, a straightforward resolution isn't directly inferable without knowing the exact implementation on the left. However, we can consider a few points:

1. The change in access modifier from `protected` to `private` on the right side suggests that the method is not intended to be overridden or accessed directly from subclasses. 
2. The addition of the `filter` parameter indicates a new functionality - filtering `OptionHandler` instances.

To preserve the functionality and intent of both sides, one potential resolution could involve creating a method with the new signature (including the `filter` parameter) on the left side as well, possibly by renaming the existing method or creating a new overloaded method. However, without the exact code from the left side, the best course of action is not clear.

Given the information and the constraint to not modify the context, the resolution involves directly addressing the conflict.

```java
     * @param handler  handler where to receive the information
     * @param len      Maximum length of metadata column
     * @param rb       ResourceBundle for I18N
     * @see Setter#asAnnotatedElement()
