To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The given Java code snippet appears to be part of a test class, likely testing the functionality of handling HTTP responses and exceptions, specifically `GoogleJsonResponseException`. The conflict arises in a test method (`testFrom_withoutDetails`), where two different versions of the code exist after a merge.

### Understanding the Conflict

The conflict is within the `testFrom_withoutDetails` method. Here's the conflicting section:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "200\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
=======
    assertNull(ge.getDetails());
    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("200"));
>>>>>>> 47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613
```

On the left side (`HEAD`), the code checks if `responseException.getDetails()` is null and then asserts that `responseException.getMessage()` equals a specific string that includes the HTTP method and URL.

On the right side (`47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613`), the code also checks if `ge.getDetails()` is null (where `ge` presumably stands for a `GoogleJsonResponseException` or similar) and then asserts that `ge.getMessage()` starts with "200".

### Resolving the Conflict

1. **Understand the Intent**: Both sides seem to be testing the `GoogleJsonResponseException` (or a similar exception) that is created from an HTTP response. They check if the exception's details are null and then verify the exception's message.

2. **Variable Names**: Notice that on the left, the variable is named `responseException`, while on the right, it's named `ge`. This discrepancy suggests that the variable name was changed somewhere in the commits.

3. **Assertions on Message**: The left side checks for an exact match of the exception message, including the HTTP method and URL. The right side checks if the message starts with "200", which is a more relaxed condition, focusing on the HTTP status code.

To resolve the conflict semantically, we should consider what is being tested and how. Both sides are checking for a null `details` and then making an assertion about the message. However, the variable name and the assertion on the message differ.

### Resolution Approach

Given that `ge` is likely a rename or a different variable representing the same concept as `responseException`, and assuming that both sides are testing the same exception object, we should align the variable names and decide on the assertion that best represents the test's intent.

If the intent is to test that the exception message includes specific details (like the HTTP method and URL) exactly, the left side's approach is more thorough. If the intent is to simply verify that the message indicates a successful HTTP status (200), the right side's approach is more flexible and focused on the status code.

Since the left side provides a more specific test condition and directly compares the expected and actual messages, it seems more comprehensive for testing the exact content of the exception message.

However, to directly resolve the conflict without modifying the surrounding context or making assumptions beyond the given snippet, we should directly compare and potentially merge the assertions if they are not mutually exclusive.

### Merging the Changes

To merge, we could potentially use `responseException` consistently and combine the assertions in a way that satisfies both conditions. However, the direct merge isn't straightforward due to the different focuses of the assertions.

Let's directly resolve it by picking one side or merging the logic:

```java
        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("200"));
    String expectedMessage = "200\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
  }

  public void testFrom_withDetails() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport();
    HttpRequest request =
```

However, the above merge introduces redundancy with `responseException.getMessage()` being checked twice. A cleaner resolution focusing on the intent would be:

```java
        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "200\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
  }

  public void testFrom_withDetails() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport();
    HttpRequest request =
```

This resolves the conflict by choosing the more specific assertion (from the left side) and maintaining consistency in variable naming.

### Final Answer

```java
        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "200\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
  }

  public void testFrom_withDetails() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport();
    HttpRequest request =
```
