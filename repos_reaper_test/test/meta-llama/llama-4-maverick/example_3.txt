To resolve this merge conflict, we need to analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a method that handles connecting a user to a server in a proxy server environment. When an exception occurs during the connection process, it catches the exception and checks if it should retry the connection or not.

The conflicting lines are within the `if (retry && !info.equals(def))` block.

The left-hand side (HEAD) of the merge is calling the `connect` method with the following parameters: `user`, `BungeeCord.instance.config.defaultServerName`, `def`, `handshake`, and `false`. 

The right-hand side (cae71552cdabc4cd1ce3f9736d59de4caadac434) of the merge is calling the `connect` method with the parameters: `user`, `def`, `handshake`, and `false`. It also includes an additional line to send a message to the user indicating that they have been moved to the default server due to a connection failure.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the different parameters passed to the `connect` method and the additional message sent in the right-hand side.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that both sides are trying to achieve a similar goal - reconnecting the user to the default server when the initial connection fails. However, they differ in the parameters passed to the `connect` method.

The left-hand side is passing `BungeeCord.instance.config.defaultServerName` as the second parameter, whereas the right-hand side is directly passing `def`. 

Since `def` is derived from `ProxyServer.getInstance().getServers().get(user.getPendingConnection().getListener().getDefaultServer())`, it seems more related to the actual default server object rather than just its name. Thus, using `def` directly might be more appropriate or at least consistent with how `def` is being used.

Moreover, the right-hand side includes a user-friendly message that informs the user about being moved to the default server, which is a good practice for user experience.

Combining these insights, a potential resolution could involve taking the `connect` call from the right-hand side and the overall structure, while keeping the essence of both sides.

However, the exact method signature and the type of `BungeeCord.instance.config.defaultServerName` are not provided. Assuming that `def` is the server info object and is being used correctly on the right-hand side, and if `connect` method on the right-hand side matches the expected signature, we could potentially resolve it by taking the right-hand side's changes.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
        } catch (Exception ex)
        {
            ServerInfo def = ProxyServer.getInstance().getServers().get(user.getPendingConnection().getListener().getDefaultServer());
            if (retry && !info.equals(def))
            {
                user.sendMessage(ChatColor.RED + "Could not connect to target server, you have been moved to the default server");
                return connect(user, def, handshake, false);
            } else
            {
                throw new RuntimeException("Could not connect to target server " + Util.exception(ex));
            }
        }
```
