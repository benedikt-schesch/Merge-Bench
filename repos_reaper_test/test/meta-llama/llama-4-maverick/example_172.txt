To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the given snippet and understand the intent of both sides of the merge.

The given Java code snippet appears to be part of a method that handles different types of elements ( possibly files or directories) and returns an iterator over input streams for the data associated with these elements. The snippet is dealing with a situation where an element does not directly match a file but might be a glob pattern.

The conflict arises in how to handle the case when the element is identified as a glob (a pattern that can match multiple files). 

1. The `HEAD` version (local changes) seems to directly return a `DataStorageInputStreamIterator` with `elements` after the `if` condition without specifying what happens when the element is a glob. It implies that `elements` is either already populated or will be handled later in the code not shown in this snippet.

2. The `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` version (incoming changes) introduces an `else` block that handles the glob case explicitly. If the element is a glob and matches files, it populates `elements` by calling `getFileElementDescriptors(elem)` and then returns a `DataStorageInputStreamIterator` with these elements.

The intent of both sides seems to be to correctly handle the case when an element is a glob and to return an iterator over the input streams for the matched files. The `HEAD` version seems to be relying on some other part of the code or a previous state where `elements` is already handled or populated. The incoming changes explicitly handle the glob case and ensure that `elements` is populated accordingly before returning the iterator.

However, upon closer inspection, there's a potential issue because both versions return a `DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements)`, and the `HEAD` version does so without the explicit handling of the glob case as in the incoming changes. 

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent and semantics of both sides, we should ensure that when an element is a glob, it is correctly handled and `elements` is populated. 

Since the `HEAD` version does not explicitly handle the glob case within the provided snippet, and assuming the intent is to handle it as the incoming changes suggest, the resolution should incorporate the handling of the glob case.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        } else {
            // It might be a glob
            if (!globMatchesFiles(elem, elem.getDataStorage())) {
                throw new IOException(elem.toString() + " does not exist");
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

However, upon careful consideration, it seems more appropriate to directly return the resolved version that incorporates both intents without the conflict markers. Here is the revised response:

```java
        } else {
            // It might be a glob
            if (!globMatchesFiles(elem, elem.getDataStorage())) {
                throw new IOException(elem.toString() + " does not exist");
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);

```
