To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The given Java code snippet appears to be part of a class that represents a Facebook Page object, likely within a larger framework or library for interacting with the Facebook Graph API. The specific field in question is related to the "likes" of a Page.

On one side of the merge (HEAD), we have:
```java
  @Getter
  @Setter
  @Facebook
  private Likes likes;
```
This suggests that there's a field named `likes` of type `Likes`, annotated with `@Getter` and `@Setter` (indicating that Lombok will generate getter and setter methods for this field), and `@Facebook`, which likely indicates that this field is mapped to a Facebook Graph API property.

On the other side of the merge (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe), we have:
```java
  @Getter
  @Setter
  @Facebook("likes")
  private Likes likesList;
```
Here, the field is named `likesList`, also of type `Likes`, with the same `@Getter` and `@Setter` annotations. However, the `@Facebook` annotation is given a parameter `"likes"`, explicitly specifying the name of the Facebook Graph API property it maps to.

Let's analyze the intent and semantics of both changes:

1. **Change in `HEAD`**: The original change simply has `@Facebook` without any parameter. This typically implies that the field name (`likes`) is used to map to the Facebook Graph API property. The lack of a parameter suggests reliance on default naming conventions.

2. **Change in `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`**: This change renames the field to `likesList` and explicitly specifies the Facebook Graph API property name as `"likes"` through `@Facebook("likes")`. The renaming to `likesList` might be intended to better reflect the nature or content of the field, possibly to avoid confusion with a different "likes" concept (e.g., the number of likes a page has, which is mentioned in a nearby comment).

To resolve the conflict while considering the intent and semantics:

- Both versions use `@Getter` and `@Setter`, so there's no conflict there.
- The `@Facebook` annotation is where the main difference lies. The version in `HEAD` relies on default naming, while the other version explicitly specifies the mapping.
- The field name and potentially its clarity (`likes` vs. `likesList`) are also points of difference.

Given that the field type is `Likes` and the nearby documentation talks about "The Pages that this Page Likes," it seems that `likesList` might be a more descriptive name. The explicit specification of `"likes"` in `@Facebook("likes")` ensures that it maps correctly to the Facebook Graph API property, regardless of the field name.

The resolution should aim to be semantically consistent and not lose information from either side. However, since the types and annotations are mostly compatible, we can consider merging the changes by taking the more explicit and potentially clearer version.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:
```java
   * @RestFB.GraphApi.Since 2.6
   * @return The Pages that this Page Likes.
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  @Facebook("likes")
  private Likes likesList;

  /**
   * The number of likes the page has.
   *
   * @return The number of likes the page has
```
