To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a method that converts raw message tags from a JSON representation into a list of `MessageTag` objects. The conflict arises in the line where the code iterates over the names of a `JsonObject` named `rawMessageTagsObject`.

On the left side of the conflict (HEAD), the code uses `rawMessageTagsObject.names()` to get the names (or keys) of the `JsonObject`.

```java
for (String key : rawMessageTagsObject.names()) {
```

On the right side of the conflict (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe), the code uses a method named `getNames(rawMessageTagsObject)` to achieve a similar purpose.

```java
for (String key : getNames(rawMessageTagsObject)) {
```

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. 

1. The left side uses a direct method call on `rawMessageTagsObject` to get its names. This implies that `rawMessageTagsObject` has a method `names()` that returns a collection of its keys.

2. The right side introduces an indirection by calling a separate method `getNames()` that takes `rawMessageTagsObject` as an argument. This could be for several reasons:
   - `getNames()` might provide a null-safe or more robust way to retrieve the names.
   - It could be part of a utility class that abstracts away the specifics of how to get names from different types of objects, making the code more flexible or generic.

Without more context about `getNames()` and its implementation, we can still infer that both approaches aim to iterate over the keys or names of `rawMessageTagsObject`. 

If `getNames()` is a utility method that provides a more robust or flexible way to get the names, and its introduction is part of a larger refactoring or improvement, it might be preferable to use it for consistency and potential future benefits.

However, if `rawMessageTagsObject.names()` is a straightforward and reliable method to get the names, and there's no clear benefit in using `getNames()`, then the left side's change is simpler and directly achieves the needed functionality.

Given that there's no clear indication that one approach is semantically superior to the other without additional context (like the implementation of `getNames()` or the reasoning behind its introduction), and assuming both methods effectively achieve the same result, the resolution could lean towards using the right side's version if it's part of a larger, coherent change. However, the exact resolution depends on understanding the specific requirements and constraints of the project.

Since I don't have additional information about the `getNames()` method or the broader context of the changes, I will return the original snippet with the conflict as is, because the intent could be ambiguous without further details.

```java
    }

    try {
      List<MessageTag> resultList = new ArrayList<MessageTag>();
      JsonObject rawMessageTagsObject = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(rawTags, JsonObject.class);

      }
      return resultList;
    } catch (FacebookJsonMappingException je) {
