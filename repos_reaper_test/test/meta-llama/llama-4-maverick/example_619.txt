To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The given code snippet is in Java and represents a part of a class definition for `FeedTargeting`, which extends `Targeting`. The conflict arises from differences in the lines related to `serialVersionUID`.

On one side (`HEAD`), there's a declaration of `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;`. This line is typically used in Java classes that implement the `Serializable` interface to define a version number for the class. It's used during the deserialization process to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization.

On the other side (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`), this line is absent, indicating either that the class does not implement `Serializable` (or it's done elsewhere in the code not shown here), or there's an intention to use a default or computed `serialVersionUID`.

Since `FeedTargeting` extends `Targeting`, we should consider whether `Targeting` implements `Serializable`. If it does, then `FeedTargeting` likely should as well, and having a `serialVersionUID` is good practice to avoid potential issues during serialization and deserialization.

However, without seeing the definition of `Targeting` or knowing its serialization status, we can only infer based on the given context. The presence of `serialVersionUID` on one side suggests an intent to manage serialization compatibility explicitly.

To resolve the conflict, we need to decide whether `FeedTargeting` should have an explicit `serialVersionUID`. Given that one side includes it and the other doesn't, if we assume `Targeting` implements `Serializable` (a common practice for classes that might be serialized), then keeping `serialVersionUID` is reasonable.

Here's the resolution:

```java
   *
   * Represents the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/post#fields">Feed Targeting API type</a>.
   */
  public static class FeedTargeting extends Targeting {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * Maximum age.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
```

This resolution preserves the `serialVersionUID` declaration, assuming that serialization is relevant for `FeedTargeting`. If the removal of `serialVersionUID` on the other branch was due to a specific reason (like `Targeting` not being `Serializable`), more context would be needed to make an informed decision. As it stands, the change from `HEAD` is retained due to its explicit management of serialization versioning, which is a good practice when dealing with `Serializable` classes.
