To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that represents an event, likely on a social media platform given the presence of the `@Facebook` annotation.

The conflict is centered around the declaration of a `venue` field. The two versions are:
1. `private Location venue;`
2. `private Venue venue;`

The difference lies in the type of the `venue` field: `Location` vs `Venue`.

To understand the intent, let's examine the context:
- The field is annotated with `@Getter`, `@Setter`, and `@Facebook`, suggesting it's a property that can be accessed (both getting and setting) and is related to Facebook's Graph API.
- The comment above the field indicates it represents "The location of this event, a structured address object."

Now, analyzing the types:
- `Location` is described as a "structured address object," which aligns with the comment.
- `Venue` is not explicitly described in the given context, but based on its name, it could also represent a location or a place where an event is held.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the semantics and intent behind both `Location` and `Venue`. If `Location` and `Venue` are semantically equivalent and both represent a structured address or a place where an event is held, the decision could depend on the specific requirements or conventions used in the project.

However, without more context on what `Location` and `Venue` represent or their differences, a safe resolution isn't straightforward. If `Venue` is the more appropriate or updated type to be used (considering the Graph API context), and it is semantically equivalent to `Location` in terms of representing the event's location, one might choose `Venue`. Conversely, if `Location` is the established type within the project for representing event locations, that would be the choice.

Since both versions seem plausible and without additional context on the project's conventions or the specific types `Location` and `Venue`, the conflict should be left as is to be resolved by a developer with more context.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved, formatted as requested:

```java
   * @return The location of this event, a structured address object.
