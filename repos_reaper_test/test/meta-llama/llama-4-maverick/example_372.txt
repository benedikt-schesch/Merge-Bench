To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes being merged.

The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles or describes a transport mechanism, possibly in a networking or communication context. The method `isMtls()` is supposed to return a boolean indicating whether the transport is using mutual TLS (Transport Layer Security).

The conflict lies in the presence or absence of the `@Beta` annotation on the `isMtls()` method. The `@Beta` annotation typically indicates that a feature or method is in beta status, meaning it is not yet stable or finalized and is subject to change.

Let's analyze the changes:

1. The `HEAD` version of the code includes the `@Beta` annotation on the `isMtls()` method. This suggests that the version of the code represented by `HEAD` (usually the local branch being worked on) considers the `isMtls()` method to be in beta.

2. The version of the code represented by the commit `51762f221ec8ab38da03149c8012e63aec0433dc` (the other side of the merge) does not include the `@Beta` annotation. This implies that either the method was never annotated as beta in this branch, or the annotation was removed.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both versions:

- If the `isMtls()` method is considered stable and not subject to significant changes in the version represented by `51762f221ec8ab38da03149c8012e63aec0433dc`, removing the `@Beta` annotation makes sense.

- If the method is still considered beta or its stability is a concern, retaining the `@Beta` annotation is appropriate.

Given that there's no clear indication of which interpretation is correct based on the provided context, and without additional information on the development stage or the intended use of `isMtls()`, the safest approach is to return the snippet as is, preserving the conflict markers, to indicate that a manual resolution is required.

Here is the response in the required markdown code syntax:

```java
  /**
   * Returns whether the transport is mTLS.
   *
   * @return boolean indicating if the transport is mTLS.
