To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class handling HBase RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls). The snippet includes error handling and logging for RPC operations.

The conflict arises from the lines:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
    final HBaseRpc rpc = rpcs_inflight.get(rpcid);
=======
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
```
and
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
The first conflict indicates that on one branch (HEAD), a line retrieving an `HBaseRpc` object from a map (`rpcs_inflight`) based on `rpcid` is present, while on the other branch (`d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`), this line is absent.

The second conflict is just an empty line and doesn't directly contribute to understanding the conflict but indicates that there are changes or differences in the context or nearby lines.

Let's analyze the intent:

1. The line `final HBaseRpc rpc = rpcs_inflight.get(rpcid);` retrieves an RPC object associated with a specific `rpcid` from a collection (`rpcs_inflight`). This suggests that the code is tracking ongoing RPCs and needs to access the specific RPC to either process its response or handle an error.

2. The subsequent code checks if there's an RPC error and, if so, deserializes an exception related to the RPC. It uses the `rpc` object retrieved earlier for this purpose: `return deserializeException(buf, rpc);`.

Given this context, the presence of `rpc` is crucial when handling RPC errors. If `rpc` is not retrieved (as in the case of the other branch), the code will either not compile (if `rpc` is used later without being declared) or will behave unexpectedly (if `rpc` is null or not properly initialized).

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent of both branches. The branch `HEAD` is using the `rpc` object for error handling, suggesting that it needs the `rpc` object for its logic. The other branch (`d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`) does not have this line, potentially indicating that either the `rpc` object is not needed, or its retrieval is handled differently.

However, given the subsequent use of `rpc` in `deserializeException(buf, rpc)`, removing this line (as the other branch suggests) would likely cause a compilation error unless `rpc` is defined or handled elsewhere, which is not shown in the provided snippet.

Therefore, the most straightforward resolution, focusing on preserving the functionality related to the provided context, is to keep the line that retrieves the `rpc` object, as it is used later in the code.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:
```java
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        LOG.error("WTF?  RPC #" + rpcid + ": ", e);
      }
    }

    final HBaseRpc rpc = rpcs_inflight.get(rpcid);
    if ((flags & HBaseRpc.RPC_ERROR) != 0) {
      return deserializeException(buf, rpc);
    }
    try {
```
