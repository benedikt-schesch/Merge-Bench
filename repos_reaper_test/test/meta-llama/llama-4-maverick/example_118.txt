To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a fragment in an Android application, given the presence of `onCreate` and `onCreateView` methods, which are lifecycle methods of a Fragment.

1. The `onCreate` method is overridden, and it calls `super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);` followed by `loadArguments();`. The conflict arises after these two lines.

2. The local changes (HEAD) simply call `loadArguments();` without any additional logic after it within the `onCreate` method.

3. The incoming changes from the other branch (`e3fe61199a31f30ef026d62e2799dcebe5d944f2`) also call `loadArguments();` but are followed by a conditional check `if (autoStart()) { executeRequest(); }`. This suggests that the fragment is designed to automatically start some request or operation if `autoStart()` returns true.

The intent behind the local changes seems to be ensuring that the fragment's arguments are loaded when it is created. The incoming changes not only load the arguments but also introduce an auto-start feature for the fragment's primary operation.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider whether the auto-start feature is intended to be part of the final merged code. If the intent is to have both the loading of arguments and the potential auto-start of a request, then the merged code should include both `loadArguments();` and the conditional check with `executeRequest();`.

Here's how one might reason about resolving this conflict:

- Both versions call `loadArguments();`, so this is not in conflict.
- The local version (HEAD) does not include the auto-start logic.
- The incoming version includes the auto-start logic after loading arguments.

Given that there's no indication that the auto-start feature is not desired, and assuming that `loadArguments()` is a necessary step before checking `autoStart()`, the resolution could involve keeping both the call to `loadArguments()` and the subsequent auto-start logic.

Thus, the resolved code snippet, returned in markdown code syntax without modifying the context or spacing, would be:

```java
    private boolean fromPaginated;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        loadArguments();
        if (autoStart()) {
            executeRequest();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreateView(inflater, container, savedInstanceState);
```
