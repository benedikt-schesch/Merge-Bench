To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The given Java code snippet appears to be part of a Hadoop-related project, possibly Apache Pig, given the class and variable names. The conflict arises in the `Combine` class, which extends `Reducer`. This class seems to be crucial for handling the combination of data in a MapReduce operation.

On the `HEAD` side, we have:
```java
private final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());
```
This line initializes a logger for the class, where the logger is associated with the current class (`getClass()`).

On the `f52ad1d45dda2f7312098d8b51fa287f11cc1944` side, we have:
```java
private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Combine.class);

//HADOOP-3226 Combiners can be called multiple times in both map and reduce
private static boolean firstTime = true;
```
Here, the logger is specifically associated with `Combine.class`, and there's an additional static boolean variable `firstTime` to track whether it's the first time the combiner is called, referencing HADOOP-3226, an issue regarding combiners being called multiple times.

Let's analyze the intent:
- The `HEAD` side is using an instance logger (`private final Log log`), which is not static and is tied to the instance of the class.
- The other side (`f52ad1d45dda2f7312098d8b51fa287f11cc1944`) introduces a static logger (`private static final Log log`) and a static boolean flag (`firstTime`) to track the first invocation, addressing a specific Hadoop issue.

Both changes seem to serve different purposes:
1. The logger change could be related to logging practices or requirements.
2. The introduction of `firstTime` is directly related to handling a known issue with Hadoop combiners.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider whether both changes are necessary and can coexist. 

The logger change from instance to static is a common practice for loggers since they are typically thread-safe and having them as static final reduces the overhead. The specific class reference (`Combine.class`) is more explicit and clear compared to `getClass()`, which could refer to a subclass if the class is extended.

The introduction of `firstTime` addresses a specific issue and seems unrelated to the logger change.

Therefore, a semantically correct resolution that preserves the intent of both sides would be to include both changes.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
    public static JobContext sJobContext = null;

    public static class Combine
            extends Reducer<PigNullableWritable, NullableTuple, PigNullableWritable, Writable> {

        private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Combine.class);

        //HADOOP-3226 Combiners can be called multiple times in both map and reduce
        private static boolean firstTime = true;

        private byte keyType;

        //The reduce plan
        private PhysicalPlan cp;
```
