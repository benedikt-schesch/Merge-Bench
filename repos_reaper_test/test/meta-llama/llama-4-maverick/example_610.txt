To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the conflicting changes.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class definition related to Facebook data types, possibly for interacting with the Facebook API. The specific class in question is `PageStartDate`, which extends `AbstractFacebookType`. 

The conflict arises from differing versions of the `serialVersionUID` declaration in the `PageStartDate` class.

1. The version from `HEAD` (typically the local branch being worked on) includes a declaration for `serialVersionUID` with a value of `1L`.
2. The version from `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` (the branch being merged into the current branch) does not include any `serialVersionUID` declaration.

The `serialVersionUID` is a unique identifier for serialization and deserialization processes in Java. It is used by Java to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have the same version of the class. If the `serialVersionUID` values do not match, Java will throw an `InvalidClassException` during deserialization.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to understand the intent behind both versions:

- The `HEAD` version explicitly defines `serialVersionUID`, which is a good practice for classes that implement `Serializable` (implied by extending `AbstractFacebookType` if it implements `Serializable`). This suggests an intent to ensure compatibility during serialization and deserialization.
- The other version (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) does not include this explicit definition, possibly relying on Java's default serialization behavior, which automatically generates a `serialVersionUID` based on the class's structure.

Since `AbstractFacebookType` likely implements `Serializable` (a common practice for such abstract types), and given that `PageStartDate` extends it, `PageStartDate` is also `Serializable`. Therefore, it's a good practice to define `serialVersionUID` explicitly to avoid potential issues during serialization and deserialization, especially if the class structure might change over time.

Thus, preserving the `serialVersionUID` declaration seems to be the more cautious and maintainable approach, as it avoids potential serialization issues down the line.

Here is the resolution:

```java
    private PageStartDate date;
  }

  public static class PageStartDate extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private Integer year;


```
