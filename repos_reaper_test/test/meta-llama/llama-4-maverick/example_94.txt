To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a test case for a `gameManager` class. The test is checking the functionality of the `gameManager` in various scenarios, such as destroying a game, reusing its ID, and handling the removal of a game from its internal storage.

The conflict arises on the line where a new `Game` object is being created and added to `gameManager.getGames()` with the ID `1`. The conflicting changes are:

- The `HEAD` version (typically the local or current branch's version) includes a `Game` constructor call with 12 parameters, missing the last parameter compared to the other version.
- The version from `ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967` (the commit being merged) includes a `Game` constructor call with 13 parameters, including an additional `falseProvider` at the end, which is not present in the `HEAD` version, and another difference is the last parameter `gameOptionsProvider` instead of `formatProvider`.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to understand the intent behind both versions:

1. The `HEAD` version is using `falseProvider` and `formatProvider` repeatedly in the `Game` constructor, suggesting that these might be providing certain functionalities or settings to the `Game` object. 
2. The other version introduces an additional `falseProvider` and changes the last parameter to `gameOptionsProvider`, suggesting that the `Game` constructor now requires or can utilize an additional setting or functionality related to game options.

Since the `Game` constructor in the conflicting line has been modified to accept an additional parameter (`gameOptionsProvider`) in the version being merged, and assuming this change is significant and intended, the resolution should likely incorporate this change.

However, directly resolving to either version without understanding the `Game` class's constructor and its parameters' meanings is challenging. 

Given the information and the changes, a semantically correct resolution would be to take the version that includes all necessary and intended parameters for the `Game` constructor as per the latest changes. 

Thus, the resolved code snippet should be:
```java
    // remove game 1 using its own method -- this should be how it always happens in production
    gameManager.destroyGame(1);
    // make sure it re-uses that id
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
    gameManager.getGames().put(1,
        new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));
    assertEquals(-1, gameManager.get().intValue());

    // remove game 1 out from under it, to make sure it'll fix itself
    gameManager.getGames().remove(1);
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
```
In markdown code syntax, as required:
```java
    // remove game 1 using its own method -- this should be how it always happens in production
    gameManager.destroyGame(1);
    // make sure it re-uses that id
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
    gameManager.getGames().put(1,
        new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));
    assertEquals(-1, gameManager.get().intValue());

    // remove game 1 out from under it, to make sure it'll fix itself
    gameManager.getGames().remove(1);
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
```
