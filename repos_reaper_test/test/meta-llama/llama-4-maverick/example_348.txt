To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that manages "now playing" events, likely in a media playback context. It includes a `try-catch` block that handles a `WifiStateException`, initializes a `HashSet` for storing `Handler` objects, and a method named `subscribe` that is used to subscribe handlers to "now playing" events.

The conflict arises in the `subscribe` method. The local version (`HEAD`) of the code has a synchronized method:
```java
public synchronized void subscribe(Handler handler) {
    Log.i("NowPlayingPoller", "Subscribing handler " + handler.getClass().getName() + " to now playing events.");
```
The incoming change (`3714d4e47f47c4d640239dfe025a1ebf91b3b624`) modifies the `subscribe` method to be non-synchronized and removes the logging statement:
```java
public void subscribe(Handler handler) {
    // update handler on the state of affairs
    final ICurrentlyPlaying currPlaying = mControl.getCurrentlyPlaying(mManagerStub);
    sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_PROGRESS_CHANGED, currPlaying);
    sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_PLAYLIST_ITEM_CHANGED, currPlaying);
    sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_COVER_CHANGED, currPlaying);
```

The intent behind the `synchronized` keyword in the local version is to ensure thread safety when subscribing handlers. The incoming change, on the other hand, seems to focus on the functionality of updating the handler with the current state of affairs without the logging statement.

To resolve this conflict, we must consider the importance of thread safety and the logging statement. If thread safety is crucial when subscribing handlers, the `synchronized` keyword should be retained. The logging statement provides diagnostic information that could be useful for debugging purposes.

Given these considerations, a semantically correct resolution would be to retain the `synchronized` keyword to ensure thread safety and incorporate the functionality from the incoming change. Additionally, we could choose to retain the logging statement for debugging purposes.

Here's how the resolved code snippet would look, returned in markdown code syntax without modifying the context or spacing:

```java
		} catch (WifiStateException e1) {
			mInfo = null;
		}
		mSubscribers = new HashSet<Handler>();
	}
	
	public synchronized void subscribe(Handler handler) {
		Log.i("NowPlayingPoller", "Subscribing handler " + handler.getClass().getName() + " to now playing events.");
		// update handler on the state of affairs
		final ICurrentlyPlaying currPlaying = mControl.getCurrentlyPlaying(mManagerStub);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_PROGRESS_CHANGED, currPlaying);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_PLAYLIST_ITEM_CHANGED, currPlaying);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_COVER_CHANGED, currPlaying);
```
