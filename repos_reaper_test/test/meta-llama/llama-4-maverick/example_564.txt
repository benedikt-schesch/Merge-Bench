To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of a test class, likely using JUnit for testing. The specific test method `checkInvalidJson` is expected to throw a `FacebookJsonMappingException`. 

The conflict arises in the `checkInvalidJson` method. The version on the left side of the conflict (denoted by `<<<<<<< HEAD`) includes a call to `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(FacebookJsonMappingException.class);` after attempting to create a new `Connection` object with invalid JSON. This line is used to explicitly fail the test if the expected exception is not thrown.

The version on the right side of the conflict (denoted by `>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) simply removes this line.

Let's analyze the intent behind both versions:

1. The original or left side (`HEAD`) is ensuring that the test fails if the expected `FacebookJsonMappingException` is not thrown when creating a `Connection` with invalid JSON. The `@Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)` annotation already indicates that the test expects this exception. However, the explicit call to `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown` is a common pattern to ensure the test fails if the exception is not thrown, making it clear that the absence of the exception is a test failure.

2. The right side (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) removes this explicit failure check. The reasoning could be that the `@Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)` annotation is sufficient to handle the expectation of the exception being thrown. The removal might be due to a preference for relying solely on the annotation for handling expected exceptions, thus avoiding redundant checks.

Considering the intent and semantics:

- The `@Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)` annotation is sufficient for JUnit to pass the test if `FacebookJsonMappingException` is thrown.
- The line `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(FacebookJsonMappingException.class);` is somewhat redundant with the annotation but was likely included to be explicit about the test's expectations in case the annotation was not present or not being used.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the original intent and ensuring clarity:

```java
  }

  @Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)
  public void checkInvalidJson() {
    new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST), "{", User.class);
    failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(FacebookJsonMappingException.class);
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_reachAllElements() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();
```

The resolution keeps the original code from `HEAD` because it is more explicit and the use of both the annotation and the explicit fail call ensures the test behaves as expected, even if the annotation were to be removed or not be functioning as expected in the future. However, if one prefers to rely solely on the annotation and trusts that it will always be correctly processed by the test framework, removing the redundant line is also a valid choice.

But since the task requires returning the entire snippet including full context without modifying it except resolving the conflict, and given that the conflict is relatively straightforward with one side being potentially redundant but not incorrect, we will return the original snippet with the conflict resolved by choosing one side. Let's preserve the original (`HEAD`) version for its explicitness.

```java
  }

  @Test(expected = FacebookJsonMappingException.class)
  public void checkInvalidJson() {
    new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST), "{", User.class);
    failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(FacebookJsonMappingException.class);
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_reachAllElements() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();
```
