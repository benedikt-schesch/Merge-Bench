    /**
     * Find out if the bag is distinct.
     */
    public abstract boolean isDistinct();
    
    /**
     * Get an iterator to the bag. For default and distinct bags,
     * no particular order is guaranteed. For sorted bags the order
     * is guaranteed to be sorted according
``` 

In the given code snippet, there is a merge conflict in the `isDistinct()` method declaration. To resolve this conflict, we need to analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The left-hand side (`HEAD`) declares the `isDistinct()` method as `public abstract`, indicating that it's intended to be an abstract method in an abstract class or interface. 

The right-hand side (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) declares the `isDistinct()` method without any access modifier and not being abstract, implying that it's intended to be a method in an interface, as Java 9 and later versions allow interface methods to be private or default (or package-private if no modifier is used, but this isn't typically recommended).

However, the contexts suggest that one is likely changing the method to be part of an interface (given the removal of `abstract` and potentially adjusting access modifier), while the other keeps it as an abstract method declaration. 

Considering the change on the right-hand side could be shifting towards making `isDistinct()` a package-private method in an interface (which isn't directly possible as interface methods are `public` by default), or more likely, this represents an incomplete or different intent that may be valid depending on the Java version being used.

Since the intent behind both versions isn't entirely clear without more context (like the Java version being targeted or whether this is part of a class or interface), and assuming that the Java version supports interface method declarations without `public` or `abstract` (for interfaces), the most straightforward resolution, leaning on typical practices, would be to pick one that aligns with the overall design (interface vs. abstract class).

However, to directly resolve the given conflict based on provided information and to avoid making assumptions beyond it, we will directly take the `HEAD` version as it provides a complete method declaration that is valid across different contexts.

Therefore, the resolved snippet is as shown above.
