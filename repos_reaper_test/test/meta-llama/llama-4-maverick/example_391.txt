To resolve this merge conflict, let's examine the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The conflict arises from differing import statements between the two branches being merged. The `HEAD` (presumably the current branch) imports `com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList` and `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals`, while the branch being merged (`ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586`) imports `org.junit.Assert.assertEquals`.

First, we need to determine the intent behind these imports. The import of `newArrayList` from Guava's `Lists` class is used for creating new array lists. The import of `assertEquals` is for asserting equality in tests, with the difference being between JUnit 4 (`org.junit.Assert.assertEquals`) and JUnit 5 (`org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals`) APIs.

The `HEAD` branch is using JUnit 5, as indicated by the import of `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals`, while the other branch is using JUnit 4, with `org.junit.Assert.assertEquals`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the overall testing framework being used in the project. If the project is transitioning to JUnit 5, the `HEAD` branch's choice might be the correct one. However, if the project is still using JUnit 4, then the other branch's import is appropriate.

Since `newArrayList` is not present in the other branch's import and is used somewhere in the code (not shown in the snippet but presumably used below the conflict), removing it might not be an option unless it's not needed or has been replaced. 

However, the main conflict here revolves around the JUnit version. Without knowing the specific usage of JUnit assertions in the code that follows, it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict.

Let's analyze the given snippet and the context:
```java
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
 * SOFTWARE.
 */
package org.infinitest;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
=======
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

import java.io.File;
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
Given that we need to preserve the context and spacing, and we are not sure how `assertEquals` is used later in the code or the overall JUnit version used in the project, a safe resolution would be to include both `newArrayList` and the JUnit 5 `assertEquals` if the project is moving towards JUnit 5, or stick with JUnit 4 if that's the project's standard.

However, the right resolution depends on the project's testing framework. 

Let's return the snippet as is, with the conflict, since we can't be certain without more context:
```java
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
 * SOFTWARE.
