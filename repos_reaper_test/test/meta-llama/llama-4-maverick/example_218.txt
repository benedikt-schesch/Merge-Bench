To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class, given the presence of `@Before`, `@Override`, `@Test`, and the use of a `PigServer` which is a class from Apache Pig.

The conflict arises in the `setUp` method:

```java
    @Before
    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        pig = new PigServer(MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
    }
=======
        pig = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
    }
    
    Boolean[] nullFlags = new Boolean[] { false, true };
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
```

On the left side (`HEAD`), `PigServer` is initialized with `MAPREDUCE` and `cluster.getProperties()`. On the right side (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`), it is initialized with `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` and `cluster.getProperties()`.

The change from `MAPREDUCE` to `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` suggests that the right side is qualifying the `MAPREDUCE` enum value with its enum type `ExecType`, which is a more explicit and potentially necessary change depending on the context or changes in the PigServer class or its dependencies.

The introduction of `Boolean[] nullFlags = new Boolean[] { false, true };` on the right side is unrelated to the `setUp` method and seems to be a separate change, possibly related to a test or another part of the class.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent of both changes. The change in the `PigServer` constructor call is likely necessary if the `MAPREDUCE` enum value has been moved inside an `ExecType` enum in the version represented by the right side of the merge. The introduction of `nullFlags` seems unrelated to the conflict in `setUp` but is a separate change that should be preserved if it's relevant to the class's functionality.

Here's the resolved snippet, preserving the original context and spacing, and presented in markdown code syntax:

```java
    private PigServer pig;
    
    @Before
    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
        pig = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
    }
    
    Boolean[] nullFlags = new Boolean[] { false, true };

    @Test
    public void testAdd() throws Throwable {
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
        
```
