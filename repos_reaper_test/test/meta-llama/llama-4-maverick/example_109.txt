To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made in both branches.

The code snippet is a Java test class for the `Properties` class, specifically for the `from(Object[])` method. The conflict arises in the import statements.

### Understanding the Conflict

The conflict is between:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.fest.test.Employee;
import org.fest.test.Name;
=======
import org.fest.test.*;
>>>>>>> 06e86330876dee7fcb1356794176b04a7161cf65
```

### Analyzing the Changes

- The `HEAD` (presumably the current branch) has explicit imports for `Employee` and `Name` from the `org.fest.test` package.
- The other branch (with the commit hash `06e86330876dee7fcb1356794176b04a7161cf65`) has a wildcard import `org.fest.test.*;`.

### Resolving the Conflict

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes.

1. **Explicit Imports in `HEAD`**: The explicit imports suggest that the test class is using `Employee` and `Name` classes. The developer has explicitly imported these, possibly to avoid polluting the namespace or to make the dependencies clear.

2. **Wildcard Import in the Other Branch**: The wildcard import (`org.fest.test.*;`) indicates that the other branch is likely using at least one more class from the `org.fest.test` package beyond just `Employee` and `Name`, or the developer preferred a wildcard import for simplicity or due to the use of multiple classes from this package.

### Semantic Merge

Given that both `Employee` and `Name` are already covered by the wildcard import, and assuming there are other classes being used from `org.fest.test` (or there will be), the most straightforward resolution is to use the wildcard import. This is because it encompasses both `Employee` and `Name`, and potentially other classes.

However, it's worth noting that some coding standards prefer explicit imports over wildcard imports to avoid namespace pollution and to make it clear exactly which classes are being used.

### Resolution

Since using a wildcard import does not conflict with the intent of having `Employee` and `Name` available (as it includes them), and assuming that the other branch's change is either currently using or intending to use other classes from `org.fest.test`, the conflict can be resolved by accepting the wildcard import.

The resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, without modifying the context or spacing, is:
```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

import java.util.*;

import org.fest.assertions.internal.PropertySupport;
import org.fest.test.*;
import org.junit.*;

/**
 * Tests for <code>{@link Properties#from(Object[])}</code>.
