To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a larger Java application that handles deployment and import of certain configurations or data, potentially within a content management or a similar system. The specific section deals with checking for and reporting "missing principals" (users or groups) after a deployment or import operation.

The conflict arises in the construction of a warning message when such missing principals are detected. The message is intended to inform the user about the missing entities and suggest a potential solution.

Let's analyze the conflicting changes:

1. **Left-hand side (HEAD) changes:**
   - The text message starts with "The following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for resource access permissions or node ownership during <b>deployment</b>."
   - It mentions "Because of these missing permissions/ownerships, <b>the functionality is not identical to the export you just imported</b>."
   - The list of missing principals is generated using `String.join("</li><li>", missingPrincipals)`.

2. **Right-hand side (83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965) changes:**
   - The initial part of the text message is slightly different, focusing on "grants or node ownership" instead of "resource access permissions or node ownership."
   - The consequence of missing grants/ownerships is phrased as "<b>the functionality is not identical to the export you just imported</b>!" (note the exclamation mark and the term "grants" instead of "permissions").
   - The list of missing principals is sorted before being joined with `missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>"))`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes and see if they can be reconciled.

1. **Terminology:** The left-hand side uses "resource access permissions," while the right-hand side uses "grants." Both seem to refer to similar concepts, but "grants" might be a more concise or specific term in this context. Using "grants" could be considered more precise if it's the standard terminology within the application's domain.

2. **Sorting the list of missing principals:** The right-hand side sorts the list before displaying it. This is a clear improvement for usability as it makes the list more readable, especially if it's long.

3. **Punctuation and emphasis:** The right-hand side ends the sentence before the list with an exclamation mark, potentially making the warning more noticeable.

Considering these points, a resolution that takes into account the intent and semantics of both sides could involve:

- Adopting the more specific terminology ("grants") from the right-hand side.
- Keeping the improvement of sorting the list of missing principals.
- Incorporating the slightly different phrasing that still conveys the same overall message.

Here's how the resolved snippet could look, presented in markdown code syntax as requested, without modifying the surrounding context or spacing:

```java
			applyConfigurationFileIfExists(ctx, postDeployConfFile, DEPLOYMENT_IMPORT_STATUS);

			if (!missingPrincipals.isEmpty()) {

				final String title = "Missing Principal(s)";
				final String text = "The following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during <b>deployment</b>.<br>"
						+ "Because of these missing grants/ownerships, <b>the functionality is not identical to the export you just imported</b>!"
						+ "<ul><li>" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>")) + "</li></ul>"
						+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf\">pre-deploy.conf</a> and re-importing.";

				logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
						+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
```
