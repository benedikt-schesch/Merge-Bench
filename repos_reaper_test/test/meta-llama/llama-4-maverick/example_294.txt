To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the code changes introduced on both sides of the conflict.

The code snippet is part of a Java class that defines a custom serializer (`Decimal128Serializer`) for serializing `Decimal128` objects to JSON. The serialization logic differs based on the type of `JsonGenerator` being used.

On the left side of the conflict (HEAD), there's a conditional check for `jsonGenerator instanceof TokenBuffer`. If this condition is true, the code doesn't explicitly handle the serialization differently than the `else` clause that follows in the resolved code; however, the exact handling is not shown due to the conflict marker. The code after the conflict marker on the left side is missing, but based on the context, it seems like it might have been intended to handle the `TokenBuffer` case specifically or continue with some other logic.

On the right side of the conflict (bdcc9aaa22f9470ce4d424736aabbc49c4857931), the `else if` condition is removed, and the serialization logic that writes the `Decimal128` as a JSON object with a `$numberDecimal` field is directly under an `else` clause. This implies that for any `JsonGenerator` that is not a `MongoBsonGenerator`, it will serialize the `Decimal128` in this manner.

Let's analyze the intent:

1. The code checks if the `jsonGenerator` is an instance of `MongoBsonGenerator` and, if so, uses its specific method `writeDecima128` to serialize the `Decimal128`. This suggests a specialized handling for `MongoBsonGenerator`.
   
2. For other types of `JsonGenerator`, the code on the right side of the conflict serializes the `Decimal128` to a JSON object with a specific format (`{"$numberDecimal": "<decimal_value>"}). This is a standard way to represent Decimal128 in JSON, as per MongoDB's extended JSON format.

Given the information and understanding that the left side seems to be missing its specific handling after the `else if` for `TokenBuffer`, and considering the intent of both sides, the right side's change simplifies the logic by removing the specific check for `TokenBuffer` and directly handling all non-`MongoBsonGenerator` cases in the same way.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent of both sides as much as possible, we need to consider if the `TokenBuffer` case needs special handling. Since the right side removes this distinction and handles it under the general `else` clause, and assuming that the serialization logic for `TokenBuffer` can be the same as other non-`MongoBsonGenerator` instances, we can lean towards the resolution that aligns with the right side's logic.

However, to be cautious and because the exact handling intended for `TokenBuffer` on the left side isn't clear due to the conflict markers, the resolution should ensure that the chosen path doesn't break the functionality intended by either side.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context. Since we are resolving based on the available information and the right side's logic is more generic and still handles the serialization appropriately for non-`MongoBsonGenerator` cases, we'll directly provide the resolved code as per the right side's changes.

```java
    static class Decimal128Serializer extends JsonSerializer<Decimal128> {

        public void serialize(Decimal128 decimal, JsonGenerator jsonGenerator, SerializerProvider serializerProvider) throws IOException, JsonProcessingException {
            if (jsonGenerator instanceof MongoBsonGenerator) {
                ((MongoBsonGenerator) jsonGenerator).writeDecima128(decimal);
            } else {
                jsonGenerator.writeStartObject();
                jsonGenerator.writeFieldName("$numberDecimal");
                jsonGenerator.writeString(decimal.bigDecimalValue().toString());
                jsonGenerator.writeEndObject();
            }

```
