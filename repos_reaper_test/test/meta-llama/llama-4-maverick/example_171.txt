To resolve the given merge conflict, we need to understand the context and the intent behind the changes made in both branches.

The given code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles file operations, possibly in a distributed computing environment given the mention of "DFS" (Distributed File System), likely referring to Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

The conflict is within the `openDFSFile` method (the first overload), where there's a blank line difference between the two versions being merged.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Left Side (HEAD):** The code on this side has a blank line after throwing a `RuntimeException` and before returning the result of `openDFSFile`. It seems to follow a coding style that includes blank lines for readability between logical sections of code.

2. **Right Side (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309):** This version does not have the extra blank line, suggesting either a different coding style or simply a removal that could be due to various reasons such as code cleanup.

3. **Semantic Intent:** Both versions are semantically equivalent; they perform the same operations. The difference is purely stylistic, related to code formatting.

Given that the difference is stylistic and doesn't affect the functionality, we need to decide how to resolve it. A common approach is to respect the coding style of the target branch (in this case, seemingly the one represented by `HEAD`) or to follow the project's coding standards if explicitly defined.

Since there's no clear indication that one style is preferred over the other within the provided context, and both versions are functionally equivalent, we should consider preserving the version that is being merged into (the `HEAD` version in this case), as it is typically considered the base for the merge.

Thus, the resolution involves choosing one version over the other for the blank line. Let's preserve the original `HEAD` version for consistency with the base branch.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
        if (wrapper == null)
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "can't open DFS file while executing locally");
        
        return openDFSFile(fileName, ConfigurationUtil.toProperties(wrapper.getJobConf()));
        
    }

    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName, Properties properties) throws IOException{
        DataStorage dds = new HDataStorage(properties);
        ElementDescriptor elem = dds.asElement(fileName);
```
