To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes involved.

The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be a part of a class where various log messages are defined as final string variables. The conflict arises in the definition of `logConnectFail`.

```java
  private final String logAlreadyScanning = "Scanning already in progress";
  private final String logScanStartFail = "Scan failed to start";
  private final String logNotScanning = "Not scanning";
  //Connection
  private final String logPreviouslyConnected = "Device previously connected, reconnect or close for new device";
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private final String logConnectFail = "Connect failed";
=======
  private final String logConnectFail = "Connection failed";
>>>>>>> f53ac04b3b41f6cb72ba8a6413a519739022cc4f
  private final String logNeverConnected = "Never connected to device";
  private final String logIsNotConnected = "Device isn't connected";
  private final String logIsNotDisconnected = "Device isn't disconnected";
  private final String logIsDisconnected = "Device is disconnected";
  private final String logNoAddress = "No device address";
```

The conflict is between `"Connect failed"` (from the `HEAD` branch) and `"Connection failed"` (from the `f53ac04b3b41f6cb72ba8a6413a519739022cc4f` branch). To resolve this, we need to understand the intent behind both versions.

- `"Connect failed"` is a direct and simple message indicating that a connect operation has failed. It's concise and directly conveys that the action of connecting did not succeed.
- `"Connection failed"` also indicates that the connection did not succeed but uses a slightly different wording. It can be interpreted as either the act of connecting failed or the state of being connected failed. However, in the context of log messages, it's clear that it's about the failure of establishing a connection.

Both messages convey the same overall intent: to log that a connection attempt has failed. The difference is more about wording than the underlying message.

Given that both versions are semantically similar and the difference is not significant in terms of functionality or intent, either version could be chosen. However, to maintain consistency with the more detailed and descriptive error messages (like `"Device previously connected, reconnect or close for new device"`), the more descriptive version `"Connection failed"` might be preferred for its clarity.

However, without additional context on the project's coding style or specific preferences for log message wording, the resolution could go either way.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the original spacing and context as requested, and considering the slight difference in wording doesn't change the intent significantly, I'll choose the version from the `f53ac04b3b41f6cb72ba8a6413a519739022cc4f` branch (`"Connection failed"`), but it's worth noting that either choice is valid.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
  private final String logAlreadyScanning = "Scanning already in progress";
  private final String logScanStartFail = "Scan failed to start";
  private final String logNotScanning = "Not scanning";
  //Connection
  private final String logPreviouslyConnected = "Device previously connected, reconnect or close for new device";
  private final String logConnectFail = "Connection failed";
  private final String logNeverConnected = "Never connected to device";
  private final String logIsNotConnected = "Device isn't connected";
  private final String logIsNotDisconnected = "Device isn't disconnected";
  private final String logIsDisconnected = "Device is disconnected";
  private final String logNoAddress = "No device address";
