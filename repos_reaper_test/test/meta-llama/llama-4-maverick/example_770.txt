To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a part of the Java documentation for a class named `DeleteRequest`. This class is used for sending delete requests to HBase, a distributed database built on top of Hadoop. The documentation explains how the `DeleteRequest` class works, particularly in relation to how it handles timestamps.

The conflict arises from a difference in how the documentation describes the behavior of `DeleteRequest` with respect to timestamps. 

The version from `HEAD` (the local branch) states that a `DeleteRequest` with a specific timestamp will delete values in HBase that were stored with a timestamp less than or equal to that of the `DeleteRequest`.

The version from `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` (the branch being merged) adds more detail to this explanation. It not only includes the original condition (deleting values with timestamps less than or equal to the `DeleteRequest` timestamp) but also introduces an exception based on whether `setDeleteAtTimestampOnly` is called. If it is, then only the value at the specified timestamp is deleted.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions. The original version provides a basic understanding of how `DeleteRequest` works with timestamps. The incoming change refines this understanding by introducing a condition that affects the deletion behavior.

Given the information, the incoming change (`d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`) seems to provide a more comprehensive and accurate description of how `DeleteRequest` behaves, especially by mentioning the impact of `setDeleteAtTimestampOnly`. This suggests that the documentation is being updated to reflect a more nuanced behavior of `DeleteRequest`.

Therefore, the resolution should aim to preserve the clarity and completeness of the documentation.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, without modifying the context and preserving the spacing as is:

```java
 * All strings are assumed to use the platform's default charset.
 * <h1>A note on passing {@code timestamp}s in argument</h1>
 * Irrespective of the order in which you send RPCs, a {@code DeleteRequest}
 * that is created with a specific timestamp in argument will only delete
 * values in HBase that were previously stored with a timestamp less than
 * or equal to that of the {@code DeleteRequest} unless
 * {@link #setDeleteAtTimestampOnly} is also called, in which case only the
 * value at the specified timestamp is deleted.
