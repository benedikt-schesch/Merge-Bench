The conflict here arises from different versions being used for the `USER_AGENT_SUFFIX`. The left-hand side (HEAD) is using `Strings.VERSION`, implying it will use a version that is potentially dynamic or defined elsewhere in the codebase. The right-hand side is using a hardcoded version `"1.2.4-alpha"`. 

To resolve this, we need to consider the intent behind both changes. If the intent is to have a dynamic version that reflects the current version of the library, the left-hand side's change is more appropriate. If the version is being hardcoded for a specific release, the right-hand side's change might be more suitable. However, hardcoding a version can lead to it being forgotten or outdated in the future.

Since `Strings.VERSION` is likely meant to represent the current version of the library and is presumably updated accordingly, using it is more flexible and less prone to being outdated. Thus, the resolution leans towards keeping the left-hand side's change.

However, as per the task's requirements, I should not modify the context or the spacing. The resolution provided above is in plain text, so I will put the original snippet in markdown code syntax as requested.
