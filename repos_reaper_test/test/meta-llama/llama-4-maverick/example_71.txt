To resolve this merge conflict, let's first analyze the code snippet provided and understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The given Java code snippet is part of a method `playersToUsers()` that converts a list of `Player` objects to a list of `User` objects and then adds all `spectators` to this list. The conflict arises in how the `players` list is converted to an array and how a new `ArrayList` is initialized.

### Analysis of the Conflict

1. **Conversion to Array**: 
   - The left side (`HEAD`) uses `players.toArray(new Player[players.size()])`.
   - The right side (`5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a`) uses `players.toArray(new Player[0])`.

   Both approaches aim to convert the `players` list to an array. The difference lies in the size of the array passed to `toArray()`. Before Java 11, it was more efficient to pass an array of the expected size (`players.size()`), but with Java 11 and later, `toArray(new Player[0])` is recommended because the JVM can optimize it better, and it's less prone to errors if the list size changes.

2. **Initialization of `ArrayList`**:
   - The left side uses `new ArrayList<User>(playersCopy.length)`.
   - The right side uses `new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length)`.

   Both initialize an `ArrayList` with an initial capacity equal to `playersCopy.length`, which is the number of players. The difference is in the syntax: the left side explicitly specifies the type parameter (`User`), while the right side uses the diamond operator (`<>`), letting the compiler infer the type. The diamond operator is a more modern Java syntax (introduced in Java 7) that improves readability.

### Resolution

Given the analysis:
- The change from `new Player[players.size()]` to `new Player[0]` is a modernization that aligns with current best practices for converting a list to an array in Java, especially if the code is being updated or maintained with Java 11 or later in mind.
- The change from `new ArrayList<User>(playersCopy.length)` to `new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length)` is also a modernization, utilizing the diamond operator for type inference, which is a good practice in modern Java.

Both changes are semantically equivalent to their counterparts on the other side of the merge and represent improvements or modernizations rather than changes in functionality. 

Therefore, resolving the conflict by accepting the changes from the right side (`5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a`) would be reasonable, as it updates the code to more modern Java practices without changing the functionality.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
   */
  private List<User> playersToUsers() {
    final List<User> users;
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    users = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      users.add(player.getUser());
    }
    synchronized (spectators) {
      users.addAll(spectators);
```
