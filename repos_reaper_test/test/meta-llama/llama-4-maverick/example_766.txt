To resolve the merge conflict in the given code snippet, we first need to understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles operations related to a table or a data storage system, given the presence of terms like `qualifiers`, `family`, and `lockid`. The conflict arises from changes made in two different branches or commits (represented by `HEAD` and `482c3930286a52c8613c46126cd84fa7013db64f`) that are being merged.

Let's examine the conflict:

```java
    } else {
      // No specific qualifier to delete: delete the entire family.  Not that
      // if `family == null', we'll delete and setting this is harmless.
      this.qualifiers = DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER;
    }
<<<<<<< HEAD
    this.family = family;
    this.qualifiers = qualifiers == null ? DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER : qualifiers;
=======

>>>>>>> 482c3930286a52c8613c46126cd84fa7013db64f
    this.lockid = lockid;
}
```

The conflict indicates that on the `HEAD` side (typically the branch being merged into), two lines were added or modified:

1. `this.family = family;`
2. `this.qualifiers = qualifiers == null ? DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER : qualifiers;`

On the other side of the merge (`482c3930286a52c8613c46126cd84fa7013db64f`), there are no changes directly related to the lines causing the conflict; essentially, the changes on this side do not conflict directly with the lines of code but indicate that the code on the `HEAD` side is not present.

To resolve the conflict, we need to analyze the intent:

1. The code before the conflict sets `this.qualifiers` to `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER` under certain conditions.
2. The `HEAD` side updates `this.family` and then sets `this.qualifiers` based on whether `qualifiers` is null.

The intent of the `HEAD` side seems to be updating the `family` and `qualifiers` fields based on the provided `family` and `qualifiers` parameters. However, there is a potential issue: the `this.qualifiers` is being set twice in the `HEAD` side - once before the conflict and once within the conflict section. The first setting is conditional and happens if there's "No specific qualifier to delete." The second setting (within the conflict) unconditionally sets `this.qualifiers` based on the `qualifiers` parameter.

To resolve this, we need to consider whether the intent is to conditionally set `this.qualifiers` initially and then unconditionally update it based on the `qualifiers` parameter. If `qualifiers` is null, it will be set to `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER`, which aligns with the initial conditional setting under certain conditions.

Given this analysis, the resolution involves deciding whether to keep the changes from `HEAD`, the other side, or a combination thereof.

Here's the resolution:

```java
    } else {
      // No specific qualifier to delete: delete the entire family.  Not that
      // if `family == null', we'll delete and setting this is harmless.
      this.qualifiers = DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER;
    }
    this.family = family;
    this.qualifiers = qualifiers == null ? DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER : qualifiers;
    this.lockid = lockid;
  }

  @Override
  public byte[] table() {
```

In markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
    } else {
      // No specific qualifier to delete: delete the entire family.  Not that
      // if `family == null', we'll delete and setting this is harmless.
      this.qualifiers = DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER;
    }
    this.family = family;
    this.qualifiers = qualifiers == null ? DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER : qualifiers;
    this.lockid = lockid;
  }

  @Override
  public byte[] table() {
```
