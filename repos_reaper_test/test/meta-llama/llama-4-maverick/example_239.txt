To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The code snippet is in Java and is part of the Apache Pig project, specifically within the `org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.datastorage` package. The conflict arises from the import statements.

On one side (HEAD), we have an import statement for `java.lang.reflect.Method;`. On the other side (1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81), this import statement is removed.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the inclusion or removal of `java.lang.reflect.Method;`.

1. **Understanding the intent of `java.lang.reflect.Method;` import:**
   - The import of `java.lang.reflect.Method` suggests that somewhere in the code, reflection is being used, specifically to access or manipulate methods of classes. This could be for dynamic method invocation, inspection, or other reflective operations.

2. **Considering the removal of the import:**
   - The removal of this import in the other branch (1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81) implies that either the code that was using this import has been removed, or the usage has been refactored to not require this specific import.

3. **Resolving the conflict:**
   - To resolve the conflict, we need to check if the code still requires the `java.lang.reflect.Method` import. If the code using `Method` has been removed or refactored, the import can be safely removed. Otherwise, it should be kept.

Since the provided snippet does not include the code that follows these import statements, we can't directly inspect if `Method` is being used. However, best practices dictate that unnecessary imports should be removed.

Without further context on whether `java.lang.reflect.Method` is used in the code, we should be cautious. If it's not used, the import is unnecessary and can be removed. If it is used, removing the import would result in a compilation error.

Given the information available and sticking strictly to the task:

import java.util.Properties;
```

To resolve it based on the intent and semantics, we would ideally need to check the code for usage of `Method`. Assuming it's not used (since we can't verify), the resolution would lean towards removing the import. However, the task requires returning the snippet as is if the intent is ambiguous or if we're unsure.

Thus, the response should be to return the snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying it, as the intent behind the change is not clear from the given context.
