To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the intent of both sides of the merge.

The given Java code snippet appears to be part of a method that handles Facebook message tags, specifically dealing with different formats or versions of the Graph API. The code is attempting to parse `rawMessageTags` into a `JsonObject` and then iterate over its keys to extract and process the associated tag arrays.

The conflict arises in the line where the code iterates over the keys of `rawMessageTagsObject`. The two versions of the code are:

1. `for (String key : rawMessageTagsObject.names())`
2. `for (String key : getNames(rawMessageTagsObject))`

The intent behind both versions seems to be the same: to iterate over the names or keys of the `rawMessageTagsObject`. The difference lies in how they access these names.

- The first version directly calls a method `names()` on `rawMessageTagsObject`.
- The second version calls a method `getNames()`, passing `rawMessageTagsObject` as an argument.

To resolve the conflict, we need to determine which method is appropriate or if there's a more suitable way to achieve the desired functionality.

1. **Understanding `rawMessageTagsObject.names()`**: This suggests that `rawMessageTagsObject` has a method `names()` that returns a collection or array of its property names. This is a plausible approach if `rawMessageTagsObject` is an object that supports such a method.

2. **Understanding `getNames(rawMessageTagsObject)`**: This implies there's a utility method or a function `getNames()` that takes an object (in this case, `rawMessageTagsObject`) and returns its property names. This could be part of a utility class or a static method that is designed to work with various types of objects, potentially providing a more generic or flexible way to access property names.

Without additional context about the `JsonObject` class being used (e.g., its library origin) and the definition or existence of a `getNames()` method, it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict based solely on the provided snippet.

However, we can make an educated guess based on common practices and the information given:

- If `rawMessageTagsObject` is an instance of a class that directly supports a `names()` method, and this is a standard or documented way to access its properties, then the first version is appropriate.
- If there's a utility method `getNames()` that is designed to work with the type of `rawMessageTagsObject`, and it's intended to be used in this context, then the second version is more suitable.

Given that both approaches seem viable but differ in their implementation, and without further information on the preferred or recommended practice in this specific codebase or library being used, the safest resolution would be to choose one based on the broader context or coding standards of the project.

For the sake of providing a resolution and assuming that the introduction of `getNames()` might be for handling cases where `names()` is not available or to provide a more generic solution, we could lean towards using `getNames(rawMessageTagsObject)` if it's a newer or more standardized way of doing things in the codebase. However, if `rawMessageTagsObject.names()` is a standard method for the class of `rawMessageTagsObject`, it should be preferred for its simplicity and directness.

Let's assume `getNames(rawMessageTagsObject)` is the intended or preferred method based on the commit history or project standards indicated by the merge conflict.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:
```java
      // message tags not in Graph API 2.5 format, ignore this exception and try another way
    }

    try {
      JsonObject rawMessageTagsObject = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(rawMessageTags, JsonObject.class);
      for (String key : getNames(rawMessageTagsObject)) {
        String tagArrayString = rawMessageTagsObject.get(key).toString();
        messageTags.addAll(jsonMapper.toJavaList(tagArrayString, MessageTag.class));
      }
      return;
    } catch (FacebookJsonMappingException je) {
