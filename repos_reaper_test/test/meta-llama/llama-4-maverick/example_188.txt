To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The provided Java code snippet appears to be part of a class that wraps an input stream (`in`), keeping track of the current position (`pos`) within the stream. The methods shown are `read` and `skip`, both of which delegate to the corresponding methods on the wrapped input stream and then update the `pos` accordingly.

The conflict arises from the fact that there are changes (or lack thereof) between the `HEAD` version and the version from the commit `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`. The `HEAD` version has a blank line after the `read` method, while the other version has a blank line before the `skip` method. Essentially, both versions are adding a blank line but at different positions relative to the existing code.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we should consider the intent behind both changes. In this case, both sides are essentially adding a blank line, which is typically used for readability and does not affect the functionality of the code.

Since the addition of a blank line is not conflicting in terms of functionality (it's about code formatting), we can resolve this by ensuring that the code remains readable and consistent.

```java
    public int read(byte b[], int off, int len) throws IOException {
        int read = in.read(b, off, len);
        pos += read;
        return read;
    }

    @Override
    public long skip(long n) throws IOException {
        long rc = in.skip(n);
        pos += rc;
        return rc;
```
