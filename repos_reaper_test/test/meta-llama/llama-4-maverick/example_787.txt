To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles a "PutRequest" in the context of a database or data storage system, likely HBase given the presence of `KeyValue` and the structure of the constructor.

The conflict arises in the constructor `private PutRequest(final byte[] table, final KeyValue kv, final long lockid)`. 

On the left-hand side (HEAD), the call to the `super` constructor includes the operation type `PUT` as the first argument, followed by other parameters: `table`, `kv.key()`, `kv.family()`, `kv.timestamp()`, and `lockid`.

On the right-hand side (d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f), the `super` constructor call starts directly with `table`, omitting the `PUT` operation type, and is followed by the same parameters as on the left-hand side.

To understand the intent:
1. The left-hand side explicitly specifies the operation type as `PUT`, which is likely an enumeration or a specific type that indicates the operation being performed. This suggests that the superclass constructor may be capable of handling different types of operations and `PUT` is one of them.
2. The right-hand side omits the `PUT` operation type. This could imply one of two things: either the operation type is not required (or is inferred elsewhere), or the superclass constructor's signature has changed to not require the operation type explicitly (perhaps it's now fixed or inferred by another means).

Given the information and focusing on the semantics:

- If the superclass constructor requires the operation type as its first parameter, the left-hand side is correct in including `PUT`.
- If the superclass constructor does not require the operation type (either it's not needed or has been changed), the right-hand side's version is appropriate.

Without additional context about the changes made to the superclass or the intent behind omitting `PUT` on the right-hand side, the most straightforward resolution based on the given information is to consider the intent of both versions.

However, we must examine if there's a common ground or if one side's change is more aligned with the overall project evolution. 

Since we don't have the superclass code or more context on why `PUT` was omitted on the right-hand side, we should be cautious. 

Let's directly examine the given code:

```java

  /** Private constructor.  */
  private PutRequest(final byte[] table,
                     final KeyValue kv,
                     final long lockid) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    super(PUT, table, kv.key(), kv.family(), kv.timestamp(), lockid);
=======
    super(table, kv.key(), kv.family(), kv.timestamp(), lockid);
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    this.qualifiers = new byte[][] { kv.qualifier() };
    this.values = new byte[][] { kv.value() };
  }

  /** Private constructor.  */

```

To resolve the conflict, we need to decide whether `PUT` should be included in the `super` call. Without knowing the superclass's constructor signature or the reasoning behind the omission of `PUT`, it's challenging to definitively resolve this.

Let's preserve the original conflict for now and provide the snippet as is, in markdown code syntax:

```java

  /** Private constructor.  */
  private PutRequest(final byte[] table,
                     final KeyValue kv,
                     final long lockid) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    super(PUT, table, kv.key(), kv.family(), kv.timestamp(), lockid);
=======
    super(table, kv.key(), kv.family(), kv.timestamp(), lockid);
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    this.qualifiers = new byte[][] { kv.qualifier() };
    this.values = new byte[][] { kv.value() };
  }

  /** Private constructor.  */

```
