To resolve this merge conflict, we need to analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The conflict is occurring on the import statements. The `HEAD` version has imports related to tasks (`GenericTask`, `TaskListener`, `TaskParams`, `TaskResult`), while the other version (`3cac0b691a1f6bce876565b41eb831a0f4e82d6d`) has an import for `BaseActivity`.

Looking at the class definition, `LoginActivity` extends `BaseActivity`. The `HEAD` version does not have the import for `BaseActivity`, but it is likely that it was imported elsewhere or was not needed at that point. The other version explicitly imports `BaseActivity`, which is used in the class definition.

There doesn't seem to be a direct conflict between the two sets of imports; they appear to be importing different classes. The `HEAD` version is importing task-related classes, while the other version is importing a UI-related class (`BaseActivity`).

To resolve the conflict, we can simply combine the imports from both versions. Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java

import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.helper.Preferences;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.helper.Utils;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.http.HttpAuthException;

import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.task.GenericTask;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.task.TaskListener;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.task.TaskParams;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.task.TaskResult;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.ui.base.BaseActivity;
import com.ch_linghu.fanfoudroid.weibo.WeiboException;

public class LoginActivity extends BaseActivity { // TODO: FIXME: 登录页面需要个性化的菜单绑定, 不直接继承 BaseActivity
    private static final String TAG = "LoginActivity";
    private static final String SIS_RUNNING_KEY = "running";
