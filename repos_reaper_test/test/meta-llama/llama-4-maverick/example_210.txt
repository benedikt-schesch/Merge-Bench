To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and defines a class `SSHSocketImpl` that extends `SocketImpl`. The class has a private static log field and two instance fields: `session` of type `Session` and `channel` of type `ChannelDirectTCPIP`.

The merge conflict arises from the declaration of the `session` field. The code snippet provided shows the conflict as follows:

```java
 * things to SSH.
 */
class SSHSocketImpl extends SocketImpl {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImpl.class);
<<<<<<< HEAD

	Session session;
=======
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f830ee309

    Session session;

    ChannelDirectTCPIP channel;


```

Let's analyze the changes:

1. The `HEAD` side has a declaration of `Session session;` with an extra newline before it.
2. The other side (commit `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f830ee309`) also declares `Session session;` but without the extra newline. Additionally, it introduces or retains the declaration of `ChannelDirectTCPIP channel;`.

The intent on both sides seems to be to have `Session session;` and `ChannelDirectTCPIP channel;` as instance fields of the class. The conflict is primarily due to the redundant declaration of `Session session;` and differences in spacing.

To resolve this, we should remove the redundant declaration and ensure that the code is formatted consistently. However, directly removing the conflict markers and deciding on the correct spacing requires understanding that both sides essentially want the same fields declared.

Here's the resolution:

```java
 * things to SSH.
 */
class SSHSocketImpl extends SocketImpl {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImpl.class);

    Session session;

    ChannelDirectTCPIP channel;
```

Let's return this in the required markdown code syntax without modifying the context or spacing unnecessarily:

```java
 * things to SSH.
 */
class SSHSocketImpl extends SocketImpl {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImpl.class);
```java
    Session session;

    ChannelDirectTCPIP channel;
``` 
However, to follow the instructions precisely and return the entire snippet (including full context) in markdown code syntax as provided, the correct response should be:
```java
 * things to SSH.
 */
class SSHSocketImpl extends SocketImpl {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImpl.class);

    Session session;

    ChannelDirectTCPIP channel;
```
