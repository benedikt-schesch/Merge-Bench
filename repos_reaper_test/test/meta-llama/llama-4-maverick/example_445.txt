To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The original code snippet is in Java and pertains to a test class related to QR code generation, specifically dealing with the scheme for Girocode.

```java
package net.glxn.qrgen.core.scheme;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.instanceOf;
import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
=======
import net.glxn.qrgen.core.scheme.Girocode.Encoding;
import org.junit.Test;
>>>>>>> 7d8e78a2b152062a876d6f8f0f8bde7550278ed0

import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;
import java.util.Set;
```

The left-hand side (`HEAD`) of the merge conflict is importing various static methods from JUnit's `Assert` class and Hamcrest's `CoreMatchers` and `MatcherAssert`. These are used for assertions in test cases.

The right-hand side (`7d8e78a2b152062a876d6f8f0f8bde7550278ed0`) introduces two new imports: `net.glxn.qrgen.core.scheme.Girocode.Encoding` and `org.junit.Test`. The `Girocode.Encoding` import suggests that the test class is utilizing an `Encoding` enum (or class) from the `Girocode` class, potentially for testing different encoding schemes supported by Girocode. The `org.junit.Test` import is for marking methods as test cases.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both sets of changes. The left-hand side is setting up assertions for test cases, likely for validating the behavior of Girocode or related classes. The right-hand side is importing necessary classes for testing Girocode, specifically its encoding and a test annotation.

Since both sides are importing different necessary components for the test class, the resolution involves combining these imports.

Here is the resolved version in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
package net.glxn.qrgen.core.scheme;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.instanceOf;
import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import net.glxn.qrgen.core.scheme.Girocode.Encoding;
import org.junit.Test;

import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;
import java.util.Set;
```

This resolution combines the necessary imports from both sides of the conflict, ensuring that the test class has access to all required classes and static methods for its functionality. The original spacing and context are preserved as per the instructions.
