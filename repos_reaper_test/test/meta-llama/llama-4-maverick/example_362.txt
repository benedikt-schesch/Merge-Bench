To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the changes introduced on both sides of the conflict.

### Original Code Before Conflict

The original code before the merge conflict is not directly available, but based on the conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b`), we can infer the changes made on both branches.

### Changes Introduced

1. **Left Side (HEAD):**
   - The `authSubTransport.addParser(AuthKeyValueParser.INSTANCE);` line is added before building the `HttpRequest`.
   - The `HttpRequest` is built using `authSubTransport.buildGetRequest();`, and the URL is set using `request.setUrl()`.

2. **Right Side (f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b):**
   - The `HttpRequest` is created using a `RequestFactory` obtained from `authSubTransport.createRequestFactory()`.
   - The URL for the request is set during the construction of the `HttpRequest` using `new GenericUrl("https://www.google.com/accounts/AuthSubTokenInfo")`.
   - The parser is added to the `request` using `request.addParser(AuthKeyValueParser.INSTANCE);`.

### Intent and Semantics

The intent on both sides appears to be to correctly configure an `HttpRequest` to fetch token information and parse the response. The left side directly uses `authSubTransport` to build the request and then sets the URL. The right side uses a more specific approach by creating a `RequestFactory` from `authSubTransport` to build the request with a `GenericUrl`.

### Resolving the Conflict

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand if the changes on both sides are complementary or if one approach is preferred over the other. 

1. Both sides are adding `AuthKeyValueParser.INSTANCE` to parse the response, which is a common intent.
2. The difference lies in how the `HttpRequest` is constructed and configured.

The right side (`f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b`) seems to be using a more structured approach by creating a request factory and using a `GenericUrl`, which is a more specific and possibly preferred way of handling URLs in the context of the used HTTP client library.

### Resolution

Since both changes aim at achieving a similar outcome but through slightly different methods, and the right-hand side change seems to be more in line with potentially updated or recommended practices (using `RequestFactory` and `GenericUrl`), we can lean towards resolving the conflict by choosing the right-hand side changes while ensuring that the parser is correctly added.

However, directly taking the right-hand side change achieves the same outcome in terms of functionality (building a GET request to the specified URL and parsing the response) and seems to follow a more modern or specific pattern for the library being used.

Thus, the resolved code snippet, without modifying the surrounding context and preserving the original spacing, is:

```java
   * @throws HttpResponseException if the authentication response has an error code
   * @throws IOException some other kind of I/O exception
   */
  public TokenInfoResponse requestTokenInfo() throws IOException {
    HttpTransport authSubTransport = this.authSubTransport;
    HttpRequest request = authSubTransport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(
        new GenericUrl("https://www.google.com/accounts/AuthSubTokenInfo"));
    request.addParser(AuthKeyValueParser.INSTANCE);
    return request.execute().parseAs(TokenInfoResponse.class);
  }

  /** Updates the authorization headers. */
  private void updateAuthorizationHeaders() {
```
