To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the code snippet and understand the intent of both sides of the merge.

The conflict is in the `release()` method. The left-hand side (HEAD) of the merge has the following code:
```java
MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.remove(mPreparedQuery);
if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
    sMediaPlayer.release();
    mBufferedMediaPlayers.remove(sMediaPlayer);
}
```
This code retrieves a `MediaPlayer` object from `mMediaPlayers` using `mPreparedQuery` as the key, releases it, and then removes it from `mBufferedMediaPlayers`.

The right-hand side (ab8ddfc) of the merge has the following code:
```java
if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
    sMediaPlayer.release();
}
```
This code simply checks if `sMediaPlayer` is not null and releases it. However, `sMediaPlayer` is not defined in this snippet.

Upon closer inspection, it seems that the right-hand side is missing the declaration and initialization of `sMediaPlayer`. It is likely that the intent is to release the `MediaPlayer` object, but the variable `sMediaPlayer` should be declared and initialized before being used.

The left-hand side, on the other hand, has a clear intent: it retrieves a `MediaPlayer` object from `mMediaPlayers`, releases it, and removes it from `mBufferedMediaPlayers`.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent of both sides. Since the right-hand side is missing the declaration of `sMediaPlayer`, it's likely that it's not a complete or correct change.

Let's examine the code more closely. The variable `sMediaPlayer` is not defined on the right-hand side of the conflict. For the code on the right-hand side to make sense, `sMediaPlayer` should be retrieved from somewhere, similar to how it's done on the left-hand side.

However, without more context on what `sMediaPlayer` is supposed to be on the right-hand side, it's difficult to make a definitive resolution.

Since the intent of the right-hand side is unclear due to the missing declaration of `sMediaPlayer`, and assuming that the conflict is not trivially resolvable by simply taking one side or the other, the safest approach is to return the original snippet with the conflict.

Here is the snippet with the conflict, formatted as requested:
```java
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void release() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.remove(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            sMediaPlayer.release();
            mBufferedMediaPlayers.remove(sMediaPlayer);
