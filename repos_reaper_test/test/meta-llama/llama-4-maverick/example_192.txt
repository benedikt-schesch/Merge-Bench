To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The given Java code snippet appears to be part of a method that dynamically instantiates an object of a certain class (`objClass`). The instantiation is done either by calling a constructor with parameters or by calling the no-arg constructor, depending on whether `args` is empty or not.

The conflict arises in the line where an instance of the class is created using a constructor that takes parameters. The code on both sides of the conflict is attempting to achieve the same goal: to invoke the constructor with the arguments provided in the `args` collection.

Let's examine the conflicting lines:

- `ret = c.newInstance(args.toArray());`
- `ret = c.newInstance((Object[])args);`

The first line, from the `HEAD` side, converts the `args` collection to an array using `toArray()` and then passes this array to `newInstance()`. The `toArray()` method returns an `Object[]`, which is what `newInstance()` expects when invoking a constructor with an array of arguments.

The second line, from the other branch (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`), casts `args` directly to `Object[]` and passes it to `newInstance()`. This implies that `args` is already an array or a collection that can be directly cast to `Object[]`, which might not be the case if `args` is a collection that isn't directly compatible with `Object[]` without conversion.

However, upon closer inspection, the key difference lies in how `args` is being handled. If `args` is a Collection, `args.toArray()` is correct because it converts the collection into an array. If `args` is already an array, then `(Object[])args` is a direct cast.

Given that `args.toArray()` is a safe operation for collections and directly returns an `Object[]`, and considering that the intent is to pass an array of arguments to `newInstance()`, the `HEAD` version seems to be handling a more general case (where `args` could be a collection).

The change from the other branch directly casting `args` to `Object[]` might be based on the assumption that `args` is already in a form that can be directly used or cast to `Object[]`, possibly indicating `args` is expected to be an array or a specific type of collection.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the type of `args`. If `args` is a collection (like a List), the `HEAD` version is correct and safe. If `args` is already an array, the other version is more efficient but assumes `args` can be directly cast to `Object[]`.

Since both versions are trying to achieve the same goal (invoking the constructor with the provided arguments) and assuming `args` is a collection (which is a common scenario in such dynamic invocation contexts), the version that is more generally applicable and safe for collections should be preferred.

Let's preserve the original snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context:

```java

                for (int i = 0; i < paramTypes.length; i++) {
                    paramTypes[i] = String.class;
                }
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(paramTypes);
<<<<<<< HEAD
                ret =  c.newInstance(args.toArray());

                ret =  c.newInstance((Object[])args);

            } else {
                ret = objClass.newInstance();
            }
        }
        catch(NoSuchMethodException nme) {
