To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a larger project, likely using Chronicle Map, a high-performance, persisted key-value store.

The merge conflict is around the import statements. The `HEAD` (typically representing the current branch or the local changes) does not include any new import statements related to `net.openhft.chronicle.core.io` package, while the other side of the merge (represented by the commit hash `b471a97a0d79b8743a4aea305aa001474127e1b1`) introduces two new import statements:

1. `net.openhft.chronicle.core.io.AbstractCloseable`
2. `net.openhft.chronicle.core.io.Closeable`

To understand the intent behind these changes, let's examine the classes and interfaces being imported:

- `AbstractCloseable` is likely a base class for objects that can be closed, providing some basic implementation for closeable objects.
- `Closeable` is probably an interface that defines an object that can be closed, similar to `java.io.Closeable` but potentially with additional functionality specific to the Chronicle library.

The presence of `MapClosable` in the unchanged part of the import statements suggests that the class or interface being defined or used in this context is related to closable operations on a map.

Given this context, the introduction of `AbstractCloseable` and `Closeable` from `net.openhft.chronicle.core.io` package likely aims to utilize or extend the closeable functionality within the Chronicle Map implementation. 

Since there's no indication that the removal of these imports in `HEAD` was intentional or that there's a conflicting change in the usage of these classes within the code snippet provided, the most straightforward resolution is to include these imports as they are likely necessary for the functionality introduced or modified in the other side of the merge.

Therefore, considering the intent and semantics, the conflict can be resolved by accepting the changes from both sides. However, since there's no actual conflict in the code (just an insertion), we simply accept the insertion.
