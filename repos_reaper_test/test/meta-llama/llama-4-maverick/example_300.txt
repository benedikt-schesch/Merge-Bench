To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a method that constructs and returns a map (`REQUEST_COMPONENTS`) containing various component registrations. The registrations differ based on a condition that is not shown in the provided snippet.

The conflict arises from the lines:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(Instantiator.class, VRaptorInstantiator.class);
=======
>>>>>>> 0b417b6a09b0560e1dbb221d37310d67f7f56fcb
```

The `HEAD` side (typically representing the local or current branch) includes a registration for `Instantiator.class` with `VRaptorInstantiator.class`, while the other side (representing the incoming changes, in this case from commit `0b417b6a09b0560e1dbb221d37310d67f7f56fcb`) does not include this registration, effectively removing it if applied.

Let's analyze the intent:

1. The `HEAD` side is registering `Instantiator.class` to `VRaptorInstantiator.class`. This suggests that `VRaptorInstantiator` is intended to be used when an `Instantiator` is requested.
   
2. The other side is removing this registration. This could imply that either `VRaptorInstantiator` should not be used for `Instantiator`, or there's an alternative registration or handling for `Instantiator` elsewhere in the code that is being introduced or modified in the commit `0b417b6a09b0560e1dbb221d37310d67f7f56fcb`.

However, just above the conflicting lines, there's a registration for `InstantiatorWithErrors.class` to `VRaptorInstantiator.class`. This indicates that `VRaptorInstantiator` is being used for `InstantiatorWithErrors`. The presence of a separate registration for `Instantiator.class` to `VRaptorInstantiator.class` on the `HEAD` side suggests that both `Instantiator` and `InstantiatorWithErrors` are intended to be handled by `VRaptorInstantiator`.

Without the context of why the registration for `Instantiator.class` is being removed in the other commit, it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict based solely on the given snippet. 

Given the information available and sticking strictly to the task instructions, the conflict resolution should be based on understanding the intent and semantics. However, the provided snippet does not give a clear indication of why one side is removing the `Instantiator.class` registration.

Therefore, I will provide the original snippet with the conflict, as I'm not entirely sure of the intent behind removing the `Instantiator.class` registration without additional context.

```java
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(OgnlFacade.class, OgnlFacade.class);
        } else {
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(ParametersProvider.class, IogiParametersProvider.class);
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(ParameterNamesProvider.class, VRaptorParameterNamesProvider.class);
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(InstantiatorWithErrors.class, VRaptorInstantiator.class);
<<<<<<< HEAD
            REQUEST_COMPONENTS.put(Instantiator.class, VRaptorInstantiator.class);
=======
>>>>>>> 0b417b6a09b0560e1dbb221d37310d67f7f56fcb
        }

        return Collections.unmodifiableMap(REQUEST_COMPONENTS);
    }
