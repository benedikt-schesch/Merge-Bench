To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided appears to be part of a Java test class for the `Utils` class within the `com.google.api.client.googleapis.util` package. The conflict arises from the import statements.

The `HEAD` side (the local changes) imports `com.google.api.client.json.jackson2.JacksonFactory`, which is likely used for JSON parsing or serialization within the test class or the `Utils` class being tested.

The other side (changes from `63ed2caecc200a407ef40b249bed158f18e2c5ae`) introduces imports for `java.io.IOException`, `java.net.URLDecoder`, and `java.util.Map` (along with `java.util.HashMap`). These imports suggest that the changes are related to handling IO exceptions, decoding URLs, and possibly using maps for data storage or manipulation.

Given the information and the context:
1. The `HEAD` side is focused on importing a specific JSON factory implementation (`JacksonFactory`).
2. The other side is importing various Java standard library classes and interfaces that are not directly related to the JSON factory or the immediate context of the `Utils` test.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both sets of changes. The `HEAD` side is clearly setting up for using a `JacksonFactory` for JSON operations, likely within the test or the `Utils` class. The other side is preparing for handling certain operations that involve IO, URL decoding, and data mapping.

Since the changes are not directly conflicting in terms of the classes or interfaces being imported (i.e., they are not importing different classes with the same name), and assuming that both sets of imports are necessary for the overall functionality of the test class or the `Utils` class, the most straightforward resolution would be to combine the imports.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
package com.google.api.client.googleapis.util;

import com.google.api.client.http.HttpTransport;
import com.google.api.client.http.javanet.NetHttpTransport;
import com.google.api.client.json.JsonFactory;
import com.google.api.client.json.jackson2.JacksonFactory;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URLDecoder;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import junit.framework.TestCase;

/**
