To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The given code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a graphics or game development project, likely using a library such as AndEngine, given the syntax and the classes used (e.g., `SpriteBatch`, `Sprite`). The code is setting up two sprite objects (`faceSprite1` and `faceSprite2`), scaling one and rotating the other. Then, it creates a `SpriteBatch` for efficient rendering of these sprites.

The conflict arises in the constructor call to `SpriteBatch`, where the first argument differs between the two versions being merged:
- The version from `HEAD` (local changes) uses `this.mBitmapTexture`.
- The version from `91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d` (incoming changes) uses `this.mBitmapTextureAtlas`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas`, and how they relate to the `SpriteBatch` and the sprites being drawn.

1. **Understanding `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas`**: 
   - `mBitmapTexture` typically refers to a texture object used for rendering.
   - `mBitmapTextureAtlas` suggests a texture atlas, which is a large texture that contains many smaller textures. Using a texture atlas can improve rendering performance by reducing the number of texture switches.

2. **Intent of Both Sides**:
   - The local change (`HEAD`) uses `mBitmapTexture`, implying that the `SpriteBatch` is being initialized with a specific texture.
   - The incoming change uses `mBitmapTextureAtlas`, suggesting an intent to use a texture atlas for the sprites, potentially for performance optimization.

3. **Resolving the Conflict**:
   - If `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas` are essentially referring to the same resource (i.e., the texture or texture atlas containing the sprites), and one has been renamed or refactored to the other, then the most recent or most relevant version should be used.
   - If they are different and serve distinct purposes, we need to understand which one is appropriate for the `SpriteBatch`.

Without additional context about whether `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas` are equivalent or serve different purposes, the safest resolution is to inspect the code further for clues such as:
- Where and how `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas` are initialized.
- Whether there's a preference or requirement for using a texture atlas over a single texture or vice versa.

However, given that the rest of the code snippet (e.g., the method override for `onDrawSpriteBatch`) remains the same on both sides of the conflict, and assuming that the change from `mBitmapTexture` to `mBitmapTextureAtlas` is a deliberate refactoring or update (potentially indicating `mBitmapTextureAtlas` is the intended or updated resource to use), one might lean towards using `mBitmapTextureAtlas` if it's the more recent or appropriate change.

That being said, without explicit information on the intent or the definitions of `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas`, I'll return the original snippet as is, because the correct resolution depends on understanding the specific context or intent behind these variables.

```java
		
		faceSprite1.setScale(2);
		faceSprite2.setRotation(45);

		/* Create the face and add it to the scene. */
<<<<<<< HEAD
		final SpriteBatch dynamicSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTexture, 2) {
=======
		final SpriteBatch dynamicSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, 2) {
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
			@Override
			public void onDrawSpriteBatch() {
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
				this.draw(faceSprite2);
			}

```
