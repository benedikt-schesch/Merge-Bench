To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a test case written in Java, using JUnit, to verify that the application's main method (`Main.main`) exits with a specific status and logs an appropriate error message when executed with certain command-line arguments (`"-t", "groovy-mte"`). The test case is checking for two main conditions:
1. The exit status of the application when it is run with the specified arguments.
2. The logging event that is captured during the execution, specifically the error message logged.

The conflict arises in the line where the test asserts the exit status of the application.

- The version on the left side of the conflict (`HEAD`) uses `SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR.getStatus()` as the expected exit status.
- The version on the right side (`d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb`) uses a hardcoded value `1` as the expected exit status.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. 

1. The left side (`HEAD`) seems to be using an enum (`SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR`) to get the status, which implies that the exit status is configurable or defined elsewhere in the codebase. Using an enum value like `CONFIGURATION_ERROR` makes the code more readable and maintainable because it clearly indicates the reason for the exit status.
   
2. The right side is using a hardcoded exit status `1`, which is a common default for indicating an error or abnormal termination in many applications. However, it is less descriptive compared to using an enum value.

Both versions are asserting that the application should exit with a status indicating an error due to missing required arguments. The difference lies in how the error status is represented.

If `SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR.getStatus()` equals `1`, then both sides are effectively testing for the same condition, just represented differently. If they are not equal, then they represent different expected behaviors.

Without knowing the exact value of `SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR.getStatus()`, we can still infer the intent. The use of `SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR.getStatus()` is more descriptive and maintainable. 

However, if the intent is to simply verify that the application exits with a non-zero status (indicating an error), and `1` is a valid error status, both could be considered correct depending on the context.

To resolve the conflict, we should choose the version that is more maintainable and aligns with the coding practices of the project.

Let's assume `SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR.getStatus()` is the preferred way to represent the exit status in this context because it's more descriptive.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
    @Test
    void shouldTellUserThatTemplateOptionRequiresInitOption() throws Exception {

        String[] args = {"-t", "groovy-mte"};

        assertExitWithStatus(SystemExit.CONFIGURATION_ERROR.getStatus(), ()->Main.main(args));

        verify(mockAppender, times(1)).doAppend(captorLoggingEvent.capture());

        LoggingEvent loggingEvent = captorLoggingEvent.getValue();
        assertThat(loggingEvent.getMessage()).isEqualTo("Error: Missing required argument(s): --init");
```
