To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the intent behind the changes in both branches.

The method `mustGenerateObjectId(Object pojo)` checks whether an ObjectId needs to be generated for a given POJO (`pojo`). It iterates over the properties of the POJO, checks if a property is annotated as an ID using `idSelector.isId(def)`, and if so, it checks further conditions.

The conflict arises in the line where it checks if the ID is an ObjectId and if its value is null. The two versions are:
- `return idSelector.isObjectId(def) && accessor.getValue(pojo) == null;` (from the current branch, HEAD)
- `return isObjectId(def) && accessor.getValue(pojo) == null;` (from the branch being merged, c417ada53c003bd4dbb38959f4581fa161b47d43)

The difference is in the method used to check if the property is an ObjectId: `idSelector.isObjectId(def)` versus `isObjectId(def)`.

Let's analyze the intent:
1. `idSelector.isObjectId(def)` suggests that the decision to consider a property as an ObjectId is delegated to an `idSelector` object. This implies a more centralized or configurable way of determining what constitutes an ObjectId.
2. `isObjectId(def)` implies a direct method call, possibly within the same class or context, to determine if a property is an ObjectId. This could suggest a simplification or a change in how ObjectId determination is handled, possibly making it a local or instance method rather than relying on a selector object.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand which approach is intended or preferred. If both branches are trying to achieve the same functionality but through slightly different means, we should consider which method is correct or preferred in the context of the overall project.

Without additional context on whether `idSelector.isObjectId(def)` or `isObjectId(def)` is the preferred or correct method to use, the conflict cannot be resolved with certainty. 

However, upon closer inspection, it seems plausible that both `idSelector.isObjectId(def)` and `isObjectId(def)` could be serving the same purpose, potentially with `isObjectId(def)` being a method that directly or indirectly delegates to `idSelector.isObjectId(def)`, or they could be part of different design approaches.

Given the information and focusing on the semantics:
- If `isObjectId(def)` is a valid method that directly checks if a definition is for an ObjectId (potentially simplifying or encapsulating the logic within the class), and its usage is the intended change from the merging branch, then its version should be considered.
- If `idSelector.isObjectId(def)` is the established way to check for ObjectId and is used consistently elsewhere, then its version is likely correct.

Since we lack the specific details on the intent behind the change from `idSelector.isObjectId(def)` to `isObjectId(def)`, let's examine if there's an obvious resolution based on standard practices.

Given that there's no clear indication that one is more correct than the other without more context, and to avoid potentially introducing a bug by making an incorrect assumption, the safest approach is to return the snippet as is, with the conflict markers.

Here is the code snippet returned in markdown code syntax, unchanged:
```java
    public boolean mustGenerateObjectId(Object pojo) {
        for (BeanPropertyDefinition def : beanDescription(pojo.getClass()).findProperties()) {
            if (idSelector.isId(def)) {
                AnnotatedMember accessor = def.getAccessor();
                accessor.fixAccess(true);
<<<<<<< HEAD
                return idSelector.isObjectId(def) && accessor.getValue(pojo) == null;
=======
                return isObjectId(def) && accessor.getValue(pojo) == null;
>>>>>>> c417ada53c003bd4dbb38959f4581fa161b47d43
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
