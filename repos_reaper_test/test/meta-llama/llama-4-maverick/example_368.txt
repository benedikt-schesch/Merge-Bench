To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The given Java code snippet appears to be part of a class that defines constants related to the Google API Client Library for Java. The constants defined here include the current version of the library and the line separator used by the operating system.

The merge conflict arises from the differing values assigned to the `VERSION` constant on the two branches being merged. 

On the `HEAD` branch (typically the current branch being worked on), the `VERSION` is defined as `"1.3.3-alpha"`. This suggests that on this branch, the version has been updated or is intended to be `"1.3.3-alpha"`, potentially indicating a minor update or a pre-release version within the `1.3` series.

On the other branch (`f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b`), the `VERSION` is defined as `"1.4.0-alpha"`. This implies a more significant update, moving to the `1.4` series, potentially introducing new features or significant changes, and is also marked as an alpha version, indicating it's not yet stable.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind the changes on both branches. 

1. **Understanding the Intent**: 
   - The change to `"1.3.3-alpha"` on the `HEAD` branch might be intended to reflect a patch or minor update within the `1.3` series.
   - The change to `"1.4.0-alpha"` on the other branch indicates a significant update or a new feature addition, moving to a newer version series.

2. **Resolving the Conflict**:
   - If the intent is to reflect a minor update within the `1.3` series, then `"1.3.3-alpha"` is appropriate.
   - If the intent is to signify a major update or a move towards a new series (`1.4`), then `"1.4.0-alpha"` is the correct version.

Without additional context about the changes made in each branch, the most straightforward resolution would be to choose one version based on the project's versioning strategy and the significance of the changes introduced.

However, since the task requires not modifying the context and preserving the spacing as is, and given that I'm to return the snippet in markdown code syntax without altering it if the intent is ambiguous, the resolution will be to return the snippet as it is.
