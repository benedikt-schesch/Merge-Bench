To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and includes a test method `checkIterator_withCursor()` that tests the functionality of a `Connection` object, specifically its cursors. The `Connection` object is created using the `createCursorConnection()` method.

The conflict arises in the `checkIterator_withCursor()` method where two different assertions are made regarding the `afterCursor` and `beforeCursor` of the `connection` object.

On one side of the merge (`HEAD`), the assertions are made using `assertThat()` from a library that is likely part of the AssertJ library, given its fluent API style. The assertions check if the `afterCursor` and `beforeCursor` are equal to specific string values.

On the other side of the merge (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`), the assertions are made using `assertEquals()` which is a method typically used from JUnit's assertion library.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. Both sides are asserting the same thing: that the `afterCursor` and `beforeCursor` of the `connection` object have specific values. The difference lies in the assertion library used.

Given that both assertions are semantically equivalent, the resolution could involve choosing one assertion style over the other. 

Since the rest of the context is not provided, and assuming that the project might be using a mix of assertion libraries or might be transitioning from one to another, the most straightforward resolution is to choose one side's assertion style.

Let's analyze the given snippet and resolve the conflict.

Here is the original snippet:
```java
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_withCursor() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = createCursorConnection();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertThat(connection.getAfterCursor()).isEqualTo("NzU1MjI1MjU0");
    assertThat(connection.getBeforeCursor()).isEqualTo("MTY1MTAyNjUxNg==");
=======
    assertEquals("NzU1MjI1MjU0", connection.getAfterCursor());
    assertEquals("MTY1MTAyNjUxNg==", connection.getBeforeCursor());
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  }

  private Connection<FacebookType> createCursorConnection() {
    FakeWebRequestor fakeWebRequestor = new FakeWebRequestor() {
      @Override
```

To resolve the conflict by picking the `HEAD` version (using `assertThat()`), the resolved snippet would be:
```java
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_withCursor() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = createCursorConnection();
    assertThat(connection.getAfterCursor()).isEqualTo("NzU1MjI1MjU0");
    assertThat(connection.getBeforeCursor()).isEqualTo("MTY1MTAyNjUxNg==");
  }

  private Connection<FacebookType> createCursorConnection() {
    FakeWebRequestor fakeWebRequestor = new FakeWebRequestor() {
      @Override
```

To resolve the conflict by picking the other version (using `assertEquals()`), the resolved snippet would be:
```java
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_withCursor() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = createCursorConnection();
    assertEquals("NzU1MjI1MjU0", connection.getAfterCursor());
    assertEquals("MTY1MTAyNjUxNg==", connection.getBeforeCursor());
  }

  private Connection<FacebookType> createCursorConnection() {
    FakeWebRequestor fakeWebRequestor = new FakeWebRequestor() {
      @Override
```

Both resolutions are valid depending on the project's assertion library preference. 

Let's return the resolved snippet using `assertThat()` in markdown code syntax as requested:
```java
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_withCursor() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = createCursorConnection();
    assertThat(connection.getAfterCursor()).isEqualTo("NzU1MjI1MjU0");
    assertThat(connection.getBeforeCursor()).isEqualTo("MTY1MTAyNjUxNg==");
  }

  private Connection<FacebookType> createCursorConnection() {
    FakeWebRequestor fakeWebRequestor = new FakeWebRequestor() {
      @Override
```
