To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is from a Java class that appears to be managing the initialization or enabling of a component or service named "Galgo." The method in question, `enable(Context context, GalgoOptions options)`, is used to start or enable Galgo with custom options.

The conflict arises between two commits:
1. One commit (represented by `HEAD`) checks if `options` is `null` and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if so.
2. The other commit (represented by the commit hash `6252198314e0911154221dbed662947c98d77aa3`) introduces a call to `checkPermission(context)` before proceeding.

Let's analyze the intent behind both changes:

1. The check for `options == null` ensures that the method is not executed with a `null` value for `options`, preventing potential `NullPointerExceptions` later on. This is a defensive programming practice that enhances the robustness of the method.

2. The introduction of `checkPermission(context)` suggests that there's a need to verify certain permissions or conditions related to the provided `context` before enabling Galgo. This could be related to security, licensing, or other forms of validation that are context-dependent.

Both changes seem to serve important purposes:
- The `null` check for `options` ensures the method's robustness against invalid input.
- The `checkPermission(context)` call introduces a necessary validation or authorization check.

To resolve the conflict in a way that respects the intent of both changes, we should ensure that both the `null` check for `options` and the permission check for `context` are performed.

Here's how the resolved code snippet should look:

```java
     * * Starts a new Galgo with custom {@link com.inaka.galgo.GalgoOptions}
     * @param context Context
     * @param options Custom {@link com.inaka.galgo.GalgoOptions}
     */
    public static void enable(Context context, GalgoOptions options) {
        if (options == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("GalgoOptions must not be null");
        }
        checkPermission(context);
        sOptions = options;
        init(context);
    }

    /**
```
This resolution combines the checks from both sides of the merge, ensuring that `options` is not `null` and that the necessary permissions are checked before proceeding with the initialization of Galgo.

The code is returned in markdown code syntax as provided, without modifying the context or spacing:
```java
     * * Starts a new Galgo with custom {@link com.inaka.galgo.GalgoOptions}
     * @param context Context
     * @param options Custom {@link com.inaka.galgo.GalgoOptions}
     */
    public static void enable(Context context, GalgoOptions options) {
        if (options == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("GalgoOptions must not be null");
        }
        checkPermission(context);
        sOptions = options;
        init(context);
    }
