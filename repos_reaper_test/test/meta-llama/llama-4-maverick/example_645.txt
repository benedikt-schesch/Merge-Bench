To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class, given the presence of the `@Test` annotation. The tests seem to be checking the content type of `BinaryAttachment` objects based on their file names or data.

The conflict arises in the `checkContentTypeBytes_html` test method. Here, we're dealing with a `BinaryAttachment` created with a file name "example.html" and some sample data. The conflict is between two assertions:

1. `assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html");`
2. `assertEquals("text/html", att.getContentType());`

Both assertions are checking if the content type of the `BinaryAttachment` `att` is "text/html". The difference lies in how they perform the assertion.

- The first line uses a fluent assertion style, likely from a library like AssertJ, where `assertThat` is used to start the assertion, and `hasContentType` is a matcher that checks the content type of `att`.

- The second line uses a more traditional JUnit assertion style (`assertEquals`), directly comparing the expected content type ("text/html") with the result of `att.getContentType()`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. Both assertions are semantically similar; they check if the content type is "text/html". The difference is in the assertion style.

Since both assertions are valid and achieve the same goal (checking the content type), we can choose one based on the prevailing assertion style in the project or personal preference. However, without modifying the context or knowing the project's preference, the most straightforward resolution is to pick one that is consistent or makes sense in the context.

Let's analyze the given code and context:
- The project seems to be using JUnit 4 (given the `@Test` annotation without any import statement, which is typical for JUnit 4).
- There's a mix of assertion styles possible, but AssertJ is commonly used alongside JUnit for its richer assertion capabilities.

Given that there's no clear indication of which style is preferred in the project and to avoid modifying the surrounding context, we can resolve the conflict by choosing one of the assertions.

Let's return the snippet with the conflict resolved by choosing the first assertion style (AssertJ or a similar fluent assertion library), as it is often more expressive and readable:

```java

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_html() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.html", attachmentData.getBytes());
    assertThat(att).hasContentType("text/html");
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_fallback() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
```
