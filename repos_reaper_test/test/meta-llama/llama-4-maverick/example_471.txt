To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the provided code snippet.

The given code is in Java and appears to be part of an interface definition due to the presence of method declarations without implementations. The snippet includes a merge conflict indicated by Git conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> a77e57ede407d2f003dc4ee4af2f8650efa56cb0`).

The conflict involves the presence or absence of two method declarations: `void setUsername(String username);` and `void setPassword(String password);`. The version on the left side of the conflict (`HEAD`) includes these two methods, while the version on the right side (`a77e57ede407d2f003dc4ee4af2f8650efa56cb0`) does not.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions.

1. The version on the left (`HEAD`) includes `setUsername` and `setPassword` methods, suggesting that the configuration or context where this interface is used requires or benefits from explicitly setting a username and password, possibly for authentication or authorization purposes.

2. The version on the right (`a77e57ede407d2f003dc4ee4af2f8650efa56cb0`) removes these methods, implying that either the username and password are not needed, are handled differently (e.g., through a different interface or mechanism), or that their explicit setting is not required or is considered redundant in this context.

Without additional context about why `setUsername` and `setPassword` were added or removed, the resolution depends on understanding the requirements or design decisions behind both versions.

However, since there's an overloaded method `setLockingMode` and other methods related to configuring memcached nodes and locking modes, it seems plausible that the interface is used for configuring a session or connection to a memcached system. In such a context, having methods for setting username and password could be relevant for securing the connection.

Given the information available and focusing on the intent and semantics, if the username and password are necessary for the functionality or security of the memcached session or connection being configured, the version that includes `setUsername` and `setPassword` methods should be considered. 

Therefore, the resolved code snippet, preserving the original context and spacing, should be returned as is, with the conflict markers included if the intent is not clear. However, based on the information given and assuming that both versions have valid reasons for their changes, the resolution leans towards including the methods if they are deemed necessary for the functionality.

Here is the code snippet returned in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
        void setProcessExpiresFrequency( int processExpiresFrequency );
        void setMemcachedNodes( @Nonnull String memcachedNodes );
        void setFailoverNodes( String failoverNodes );
        void setLockingMode( @Nullable final String lockingMode );
        void setLockingMode( @Nullable final LockingMode lockingMode, @Nullable final Pattern uriPattern, final boolean storeSecondaryBackup );
<<<<<<< HEAD
        void setUsername(String username);
        void setPassword(String password);
