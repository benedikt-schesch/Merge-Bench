To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of a constructor for a `PigContext` object. The constructor takes two parameters: `execType` of type `ExecType` and `properties` of type `Properties`. The merge conflict is located after the initialization of `this.execType` and `this.properties` within this constructor.

```java
    }
        
    public PigContext(ExecType execType, Properties properties){
        this.execType = execType;
        this.properties = properties;

        String pigJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(Main.class);
        String hadoopJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(FileSystem.class);
        if (pigJar != null) {
            skipJars.add(pigJar);
            if (!pigJar.equals(hadoopJar))
```

Let's examine the conflict:
- The `HEAD` version (typically the local version or the one being merged into) has an empty line or possibly some code that was removed or not committed.
- The other version (with the commit hash `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) includes code related to finding the JAR files containing `Main.class` and `FileSystem.class`, and then conditionally adds the `pigJar` to `skipJars` based on certain conditions.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions. The code after the conflict marker is adding a `pigJar` and checking if it's different from `hadoopJar` to `skipJars`. The intent here seems to be configuring or initializing the `PigContext` with certain properties or settings related to JAR files.

Since there's no actual code change conflicting (the conflict is essentially about whether to include a blank line or some omitted code versus the code that follows), and assuming the code after the conflict markers is semantically correct and necessary for the functionality of `PigContext`, the resolution involves deciding whether the blank line or omitted code in `HEAD` is necessary.

Given that there's no code in the `HEAD` side that is being overridden or conflicted with in terms of functionality, and assuming the code on the other side (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) is functionally necessary or correct, the simplest resolution is to remove the conflict markers and keep the code that follows.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:
```java
    }
        
    public PigContext(ExecType execType, Properties properties){
        this.execType = execType;
        this.properties = properties;   

        String pigJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(Main.class);
        String hadoopJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(FileSystem.class);
        if (pigJar != null) {
            skipJars.add(pigJar);
            if (!pigJar.equals(hadoopJar))
```
