To resolve the given merge conflict, we need to first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a larger method that is responsible for gathering information about a game, including the names of players and spectators. The specific section provided iterates over a collection of players and spectators, extracting their nicknames and storing them in a data structure (`info`) under specific keys (`GameInfo.PLAYERS` and `GameInfo.SPECTATORS`).

The merge conflict occurs in the lines related to initializing `spectatorsCopy` and `spectatorNames`. Let's examine the differences:

1. `final User[] spectatorsCopy = spectators.toArray(new User[spectators.size()]);` vs `final User[] spectatorsCopy = spectators.toArray(new User[0]);`
   - Both lines are converting a collection (`spectators`) into an array (`spectatorsCopy`). 
   - The change here involves the size of the array passed to `toArray()`. Before Java 11, it was more efficient to pass an array of the correct size to avoid an intermediate array creation. The `new User[spectators.size()]` approach was common for this reason.
   - As of Java 11 and later, `toArray(new User[0])` is recommended because the JVM can optimize this case better than creating an array of the correct size manually. The `toArray()` method with an empty array is now generally considered more idiomatic and potentially more efficient due to JVM optimizations.

2. `final List<String> spectatorNames = new ArrayList<String>(spectatorsCopy.length);` vs `final List<String> spectatorNames = new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length);`
   - The change here is in the way the `ArrayList` is initialized. 
   - The difference is the presence of the type parameter (`String`) in the constructor call. Prior to Java 7, you needed to specify the type parameter on both sides of the assignment (diamond operator was introduced in Java 7 to reduce redundancy). The version without the explicit type parameter (`new ArrayList<>`) is using the diamond operator, which allows the compiler to infer the type parameter from the declaration.

To resolve the conflict, we should consider the intent and the semantic implications of both versions. 

- The change from `new User[spectators.size()]` to `new User[0]` is related to the efficiency and idiomatic usage in newer Java versions. 
- The change from `new ArrayList<String>` to `new ArrayList<>` is related to using the diamond operator for type inference, making the code more concise.

Both changes are improvements in terms of using more modern Java idioms and potentially benefiting from JVM optimizations.

Given that the intent is clear and both sides of the conflict are making improvements that are not semantically different in terms of functionality but rather in terms of style and potentially efficiency, we can resolve the conflict by choosing the version that aligns with more modern Java practices.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      playerNames.add(player.getUser().getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.PLAYERS, playerNames);

    final User[] spectatorsCopy = spectators.toArray(new User[0]);
    final List<String> spectatorNames = new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length);
    for (final User spectator : spectatorsCopy) {
      spectatorNames.add(spectator.getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.SPECTATORS, spectatorNames);
```
