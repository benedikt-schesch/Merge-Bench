To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and intent of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of a test class for Facebook API connections, specifically testing the `Connection` class with different versions of the Facebook API.

The merge conflict occurs in the `checkV1_0` test method. Here, we have two different versions of assertions:

1. The version from `HEAD` (the current branch) uses `assertThat` from a library like AssertJ, which provides a fluent API for assertions. The assertions check that:
   - `con.getTotalCount()` is null.
   - `con.getNextPageUrl()` is not null.
   - `con.hasNext()` is true.

2. The version from `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` (the branch being merged) uses JUnit's assertion methods (`assertEquals`, `assertNotNull`, `assertTrue`) to make the same logical checks.

Both versions are semantically equivalent; they are testing the same conditions. The difference lies in the assertion library/methods used.

To resolve the conflict, we need to decide which assertion style to keep. However, without additional context or a clear directive on which style is preferred or if there's a specific reason to choose one over the other (like a project standard), both resolutions are valid.

That being said, since the intent is the same on both sides and the functionality isn't altered by the choice between these assertion styles, we can choose one. Let's keep the `HEAD` version for consistency if the project typically uses AssertJ, or switch to the other if JUnit assertions are preferred.

Let's resolve it by keeping the `HEAD` version since it doesn't introduce any new dependency if AssertJ is already used elsewhere.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java

  @Test
  public void checkV1_0() {
    Connection<User> con = new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST),
      jsonFromClasspath("v1_0/connection-user-friends"), User.class);
    assertThat(con.getTotalCount()).isNull();
    assertThat(con.getNextPageUrl()).isNotNull();
    assertThat(con.hasNext()).isTrue();
  }

  @Test
  public void checkV2_0() {
    Connection<User> con = new Connection<User>(new DefaultFacebookClient(Version.LATEST),
```
