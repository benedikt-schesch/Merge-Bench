To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a Jenkins security module, given the import statements and the package name `hudson.security`. The conflict arises from different modifications made to the import statements in the file.

Let's examine the changes:

1. The left side of the conflict (`HEAD`) has imported `jenkins.security.ApiTokenProperty` and `jenkins.security.SecurityListener`. These imports suggest that the code is utilizing or manipulating API token properties and security listeners, possibly as part of authentication or authorization processes within Jenkins.

2. The right side of the conflict (`88fb3d460fede1cf0b6c460e123a9856bdd7448f`) has imported `jenkins.security.BasicApiTokenHelper`. This import indicates the use of a helper class for handling basic API tokens, which could be related to authentication or authorization as well.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider whether both sets of changes are necessary and how they contribute to the overall functionality of the code.

Given that the imports are related to security and API token handling within Jenkins, and without the actual code that uses these imports, we can infer the following:

- If the code within the file utilizes both `ApiTokenProperty`, `SecurityListener`, and `BasicApiTokenHelper`, then both sets of imports are necessary.
- The introduction of `BasicApiTokenHelper` on the right side might be related to a change in how API tokens are handled, potentially replacing or complementing the functionality related to `ApiTokenProperty`.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent of both sides, we should combine the imports if they are both necessary. Here's how we can do it:

```java
package hudson.security;

import hudson.model.User;
import jenkins.model.Jenkins;
import hudson.util.Scrambler;
import jenkins.security.ApiTokenProperty;
import jenkins.security.BasicApiTokenHelper;
import jenkins.security.SecurityListener;
import org.acegisecurity.Authentication;
import org.acegisecurity.context.SecurityContextHolder;
import org.acegisecurity.userdetails.UserDetails;

import javax.servlet.Filter;
import javax.servlet.FilterChain;
```

However, the task requires us to return the entire snippet in markdown code syntax as provided, without modifying the context or spacing. Thus, the resolved version should be presented as:

```java
package hudson.security;

import hudson.model.User;
import jenkins.model.Jenkins;
import hudson.util.Scrambler;
import jenkins.security.ApiTokenProperty;
import jenkins.security.BasicApiTokenHelper;
import jenkins.security.SecurityListener;
import org.acegisecurity.Authentication;
import org.acegisecurity.context.SecurityContextHolder;
import org.acegisecurity.userdetails.UserDetails;

import javax.servlet.Filter;
import javax.servlet.FilterChain;
```
