To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the snippet and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The original code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of an Android activity. It involves setting up a presenter for a content editor, configuring schedulers for RxJava operations, and customizing the action bar and toolbar.

The conflict arises from the introduction of a new conditional statement that checks if the support action bar is not null before attempting to set its background drawable. This change is introduced in the `f8f91f1d455f6842ca57b8294f6a263ff0cde1e4` commit.

Let's examine the code before and after the conflict:

```java
Scheduler observeOn = AndroidSchedulers.mainThread();
Scheduler subscribeOn = Schedulers.io();
contentEditorPresenter = new ContentEditorPresenter(getString(R.string.imgur_client_id), new ImgurUpload(), observeOn, subscribeOn);

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
if (getSupportActionBar() != null) {
  getSupportActionBar().setBackgroundDrawable(new ColorDrawable(AttributesUtils.getPrimaryColor(this)));
}

>>>>>>> f8f91f1d455f6842ca57b8294f6a263ff0cde1e4
toolbarExtra.inflateMenu(R.menu.content_editor_extra);
toolbarExtra.setOnMenuItemClickListener(this);

final String hint = getIntent().getExtras().getString(HINT);
```

The code on the left side of the conflict (`HEAD`) continues with setting up `toolbarExtra` and retrieving a hint from the intent extras without any interruptions.

The change introduced on the right side (`f8f91f1d455f6842ca57b8294f6a263ff0cde1e4`) adds a check for the support action bar and sets its background color if it's not null. This change seems to be related to customizing the action bar's appearance.

To resolve this conflict, we should consider whether the customization of the action bar's background color is essential and if it conflicts with any other changes or functionality introduced by the `HEAD` side.

Upon inspection, it seems that the changes are not directly related; one is about setting up a presenter and toolbar, and the other is about customizing the action bar. Therefore, we can likely integrate both changes without semantic conflicts.

Here's the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java

      Scheduler observeOn = AndroidSchedulers.mainThread();
      Scheduler subscribeOn = Schedulers.io();
      contentEditorPresenter = new ContentEditorPresenter(getString(R.string.imgur_client_id), new ImgurUpload(), observeOn, subscribeOn);

      if (getSupportActionBar() != null) {
        getSupportActionBar().setBackgroundDrawable(new ColorDrawable(AttributesUtils.getPrimaryColor(this)));
      }

      toolbarExtra.inflateMenu(R.menu.content_editor_extra);
      toolbarExtra.setOnMenuItemClickListener(this);

      final String hint = getIntent().getExtras().getString(HINT);

```
