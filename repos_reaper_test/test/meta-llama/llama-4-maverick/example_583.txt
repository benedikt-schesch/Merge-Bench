To resolve this merge conflict, we first need to understand the intent and semantics behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The given code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a Javadoc comment, providing usage guidelines for various methods related to fetching and manipulating data, likely in the context of Facebook's API given the mention of "FQL query" (Facebook Query Language).

The conflict arises from the addition of a new list item (`<li>`) on the branch represented by `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`, which includes documentation for executing FQL queries. The original branch (represented by `HEAD`) does not have this addition.

Let's analyze the changes:

1. The original code (`HEAD`) lists several operations that can be performed, such as fetching objects, fetching connections, executing operations in batch, publishing data, and deleting objects.
2. The change introduced by `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` adds documentation for executing FQL queries, which includes two methods: `executeFqlQuery` and `executeFqlMultiquery`.

The intent behind the change is to document additional functionality related to FQL queries. FQL was a query language used by Facebook's API to fetch data, suggesting that this documentation is relevant for users of the API who need to perform complex queries.

To resolve the conflict, we should consider whether the addition of FQL query documentation is relevant and correctly placed within the list of operations. Since FQL queries represent a distinct category of operations (querying data), it makes sense to include them alongside other data fetching and manipulation operations.

Given the context and the nature of the change, it seems reasonable to include the documentation for FQL queries as it enhances the usability of the API documentation by providing a more comprehensive overview of available operations.

Thus, the resolution involves accepting the change from `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`, which adds the necessary documentation.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
