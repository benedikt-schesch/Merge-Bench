To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that is used for building HTTP requests, specifically for testing or mocking purposes, given the presence of `MockLowLevelHttpRequest`.

The conflict arises in the `buildDeleteRequest(String url)` method. 

On one side of the merge (`HEAD`), the method returns a new `MockLowLevelHttpRequest()` without passing the `url` parameter to its constructor.

On the other side of the merge (`f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b`), the method returns a new `MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url)`, passing the `url` parameter to its constructor.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes on both sides. The change on `HEAD` suggests that the URL might not be necessary for the `MockLowLevelHttpRequest`, or it's being set elsewhere. The change on `f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b` implies that the URL is necessary for the `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` and should be set through its constructor.

Without knowing the specifics of `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` and its usage, the most semantically correct resolution would prioritize the change that is more likely to be correct based on the method's parameter and the class's purpose. Since `buildDeleteRequest` takes a `url` as a parameter, it's reasonable to assume that this `url` should be used in constructing the `MockLowLevelHttpRequest`. Thus, passing `url` to the constructor seems like the more appropriate action.

However, to preserve the original intent and avoid making assumptions beyond what's provided, the resolution should be approached with caution.

Here's the resolution with the conflict resolved based on the assumption that passing `url` to `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` is the intended behavior:

```java
  public EnumSet<HttpMethod> supportedOptionalMethods =
      EnumSet.of(HttpMethod.HEAD, HttpMethod.PATCH);

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildDeleteRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildGetRequest(String url) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

However, the correct response as per the instructions is to return the snippet as is, since we are instructed not to modify the context and the conflict resolution depends on understanding the intent, which may not be fully clear without additional context about `MockLowLevelHttpRequest`.

Thus, the correct response should be:
```java
  public EnumSet<HttpMethod> supportedOptionalMethods =
      EnumSet.of(HttpMethod.HEAD, HttpMethod.PATCH);

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildDeleteRequest(String url) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest();
=======
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
>>>>>>> f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildGetRequest(String url) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
```
