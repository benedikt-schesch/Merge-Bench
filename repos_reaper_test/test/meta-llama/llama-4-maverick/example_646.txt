To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test suite for a class or method handling binary attachments. The specific tests are checking the content type of a `BinaryAttachment` object under different conditions.

The merge conflict occurs in the `checkContentTypeBytes_fallback` test method. Here's the conflicting snippet again:

```java
  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_fallback() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.json", attachmentData.getBytes());
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertThat(att).hasContentType("application/octet-stream");
=======
    assertEquals("application/octet-stream", att.getContentType());
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_manual() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
```

Let's analyze the conflicting lines:

1. The left-hand side (`HEAD`) uses `assertThat(att).hasContentType("application/octet-stream");`. This line is using an assertion library (likely AssertJ) to verify that the `BinaryAttachment` object `att` has a content type of `"application/octet-stream"`. The `assertThat` method is typically used with a fluent API to make assertions on the object being tested.

2. The right-hand side (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) uses `assertEquals("application/octet-stream", att.getContentType());`. This line is using JUnit's `assertEquals` method to directly compare the result of `att.getContentType()` with the expected content type. This assertion directly checks the content type of the attachment by calling a getter method.

Both assertions aim to verify that the content type of the `BinaryAttachment` is `"application/octet-stream"`. The difference lies in the assertion style and the method used to retrieve or verify the content type.

To resolve the conflict, we need to decide which assertion style is preferred or if both can be used interchangeably. Since both lines are semantically equivalent in terms of intent (checking if the content type is `"application/octet-stream"`), we can choose one based on the project's testing style or conventions.

If the project uses AssertJ, the first assertion is more idiomatic. If the project prefers or is restricted to using JUnit assertions, the second form is appropriate.

Let's assume the project is using AssertJ, given the fluent assertion style. However, without more context about the project's conventions, both resolutions are potentially valid.

Given that the intent is clear and both assertions check the same condition, we can resolve the conflict by choosing one of the assertions. Let's choose the AssertJ version for consistency with the fluent assertion style, which is often more readable.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_fallback() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.json", attachmentData.getBytes());
    assertThat(att).hasContentType("application/octet-stream");
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_manual() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
```
