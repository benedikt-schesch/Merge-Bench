To resolve the merge conflict in the provided Java code snippet, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The original code snippet is as follows:
```java
            throw new IOException(e);
        }

    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    static public void copyFromClusterToLocal(MiniGenericCluster cluster,
            String fileNameOnCluster, String localFileName) throws IOException {
=======
	static public void copyFromClusterToLocal(MiniCluster cluster, String fileNameOnCluster, String localFileName) throws IOException {
        if(Util.WINDOWS){
            fileNameOnCluster = fileNameOnCluster.replace('\\','/');
            localFileName = localFileName.replace('\\','/');
        }
>>>>>>> 8923da8cd49c041d99fd5996ddf807f54915c79e
	    File parent = new File(localFileName).getParentFile();
	    if (!parent.exists()) {
	        parent.mkdirs();
	    }
	    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(localFileName));
```

First, let's examine the differences:
- The method `copyFromClusterToLocal` is defined with a parameter of type `MiniGenericCluster` on the `HEAD` side.
- On the other side (`8923da8cd49c041d99fd5996ddf807f54915c79e`), the method is defined with a parameter of type `MiniCluster`, and there's an additional check for `Util.WINDOWS` to replace backslashes with forward slashes in file names.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes.

1. The change in the type of the `cluster` parameter from `MiniGenericCluster` to `MiniCluster` might indicate a refactoring or a change in the design where `MiniCluster` is the new or preferred type to be used. 
2. The addition of the `if (Util.WINDOWS)` block suggests a fix or enhancement to handle file path separators correctly on Windows.

Since both changes seem to serve different purposes and do not directly conflict with each other in terms of functionality (one is about the type of a parameter and the other is about handling file paths on Windows), a reasonable resolution could be to combine these changes.

Here's the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:
```java
            throw new IOException(e);
        }

    }

	static public void copyFromClusterToLocal(MiniCluster cluster,
            String fileNameOnCluster, String localFileName) throws IOException {
        if(Util.WINDOWS){
            fileNameOnCluster = fileNameOnCluster.replace('\\','/');
            localFileName = localFileName.replace('\\','/');
        }
	    File parent = new File(localFileName).getParentFile();
	    if (!parent.exists()) {
	        parent.mkdirs();
	    }
	    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(localFileName));
```
