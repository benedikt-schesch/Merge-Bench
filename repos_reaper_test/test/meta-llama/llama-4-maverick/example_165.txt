To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the context and the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The conflict is in the `fileExists` method that takes a `String filename` and a `PigContext context` as parameters. The method is supposed to check if a file exists.

On one side of the merge (HEAD), the code is calling `fileExists(filename, context.getDfs())`. Here, `context.getDfs()` is being used, which likely returns a reference to a distributed file system (DFS).

On the other side of the merge (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309), the code is calling `fileExists(filename, context.getFs())`. Here, `context.getFs()` is being used, which could return a reference to a file system, potentially a more generic or local file system compared to DFS.

The method `fileExists(String filename, DataStorage store)` is overloaded and is called by both versions. It uses the `DataStorage` object to check if the file exists.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind `context.getDfs()` and `context.getFs()`. 

- If `context.getDfs()` and `context.getFs()` serve the same purpose or if `context.getFs()` is a more appropriate or updated way to get the file system reference that should be used, then we should choose `context.getFs()`.
- If they serve different purposes and the distinction is important, we need to understand which one is relevant in this context.

Given the information and without additional context on what `PigContext` is or the difference between `getDfs()` and `getFs()`, it seems that both are trying to achieve a similar goal but potentially through different means or APIs.

Since `DataStorage` is used in the overloaded method, and assuming `context.getFs()` is more aligned with returning a `DataStorage` or a more generic file system that could be either local or distributed, we can make an educated guess.

However, without knowing the specifics of `PigContext`, `getDfs()`, and `getFs()`, the safest resolution would be to pick the version that seems more appropriate or updated based on the commit history or the intent of the changes.

Let's resolve it by choosing the version from the other side of the merge (`context.getFs()`), assuming it's the more updated or appropriate method to get the file system.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:
```java
        }
    }

    public static boolean fileExists(String filename, PigContext context)
            throws IOException {
        return fileExists(filename, context.getFs());
    }

    public static boolean fileExists(String filename, DataStorage store)
            throws IOException {
        ElementDescriptor elem = store.asElement(filename);
```
