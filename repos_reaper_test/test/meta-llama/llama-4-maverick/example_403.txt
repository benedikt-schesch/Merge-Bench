To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is using `yt-dlp`, a command-line program to download videos, with specific options to select the best video and audio qualities based on certain criteria. The criteria include:
1. Video codec not better than h264.
2. Audio codec not better than aac.
3. Resolution not larger than 576 (in terms of height or width).

The conflict arises in the sorting/filtering options passed to `yt-dlp`, specifically with the `-S` or `--sort-extra` option, which is used to sort the video formats based on certain criteria.

On the `HEAD` side, the `-S` option is used with `vcodec:h264,res:576,acodec:aac`. This means the sorting is based on:
1. Video codec being h264 or worse (`vcodec:h264`).
2. Resolution being 576 or lower (`res:576`).
3. Audio codec being aac or worse (`acodec:aac`).

On the other side of the merge (`8549031e59a43d7b4f2763f42d84b589806c9176`), the `-S` option is used with `res:576,hcodec:h264,acodec:aac`. Here, the sorting is based on:
1. Resolution being 576 or lower (`res:576`).
2. `hcodec:h264` which likely intends to specify the video codec (though `hcodec` is not a standard option; it should be `vcodec` for video codec).

The intent on both sides seems to be to download videos with a resolution not larger than 576, with a video codec not better than h264, and an audio codec not better than aac. However, there's a typo or inconsistency in the second version (`hcodec` instead of `vcodec`).

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent:
- We should correct `hcodec` to `vcodec` to ensure it refers to the video codec.
- The order of the sorting criteria might not be crucial if `yt-dlp` is designed to handle the criteria flexibly, but typically, one would prioritize resolution first (`res:576`), followed by the codec preferences.

Given the above analysis, a semantically correct resolution that aligns with the intent of both sides would be to use `res:576,vcodec:h264,acodec:aac` with the `-S` option. This maintains the resolution constraint first and then applies the codec preferences.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
         * Download the best video with best vcodec no better than h264 and
         * the best audio with best acodec no better than aac and
         * with neither height nor width larger than 576.
