To resolve the merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The original code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a Jenkins plugin, given the use of `Jenkins.get()` and `StaplerRequest`. The method `doSubmit` is annotated with `@RequirePOST`, indicating it's intended to handle HTTP POST requests.

The conflict arises in the `doSubmit` method. The left side of the conflict (from `HEAD`) does not include any permission check before proceeding with the method's logic. The right side (from `817f1149781eeb3ceea7839ab3213d2d2fdc9b3d`) introduces a permission check: `Jenkins.get().checkPermission(Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS);`.

To understand the intent of both sides:
1. The left side (original or other branch's change) seems to be focused on the functionality within `doSubmit`, handling a form submission or a similar action, without explicitly checking for the `RUN_SCRIPTS` permission.
2. The right side introduces a check for `Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS` permission, implying that the action within `doSubmit` requires the user to have the permission to run scripts. This is a security-related change, ensuring that only authorized users can perform the action handled by `doSubmit`.

Given these intents, the resolution should ensure that the security check is applied while preserving the original functionality. Therefore, the correct resolution is to include the permission check introduced by the right side, as it enhances security without altering the functional logic presented on the left side.

Here's the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
        return filePathRules.checkFileAccess(op, f);
    }

    @RequirePOST
    public HttpResponse doSubmit(StaplerRequest req) throws IOException {
        Jenkins.get().checkPermission(Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS);
        String whitelist = Util.fixNull(req.getParameter("whitelist"));
        if (!whitelist.endsWith("\n"))
            whitelist+="\n";

        Enumeration e = req.getParameterNames();
```
