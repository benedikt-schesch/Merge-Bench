To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a larger system managing regions in a 3D environment, possibly a game or a simulation, using the Spout engine. The snippet checks if a `current` object is not null and returns it if so. If `current` is null, it adds an asynchronous manager for a `region` using the `SpoutScheduler`. After this point, a merge conflict occurs.

The conflict arises because the two branches being merged have differing changes after the line where the async manager is added. 

- The local branch (`HEAD`) doesn't introduce any new code after adding the async manager.
- The other branch (`7739f34e2d873b026a191c17c3f10396638d0144`) adds a conditional statement to check if the current platform is `CLIENT`, and if so, it starts a mesh generator thread for the `region`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both changes.

1. The local branch (`HEAD`) seems to be focused on adding the async manager without any additional actions related to the `region` or platform check.
2. The other branch introduces a platform-specific behavior (starting a mesh generator thread on the client) that is not present in the local branch.

Given that there's no inherent conflict in the semantics or intent (one branch adds a feature, and the other doesn't), and assuming both changes are valid in their respective contexts, the resolution involves deciding whether the platform check and subsequent action should be included.

Since the other branch's change (`7739f34e2d873b026a191c17c3f10396638d0144`) introduces a reasonable and non-conflicting functionality that is dependent on the platform (CLIENT), and there's no indication that this change is incorrect or redundant, incorporating this change seems logical.

Thus, the resolution involves accepting both changes: adding the async manager and, if on the client platform, starting the mesh generator thread.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
		if (current != null) {
			return current;
		}
		
		((SpoutScheduler)Spout.getScheduler()).addAsyncManager(region);

		if (Spout.getEngine().getPlatform() == Platform.CLIENT) {
			region.startMeshGeneratorThread();
		}

		int threshold = warnThreshold.get();
		if (regionsLoaded.getAndIncrement() > threshold) {
			Spout.getLogger().info("Warning: number of spout regions exceeds " + threshold + " when creating (" +
                x + ", " + y + ", " + z + ")");
```
