To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class, given the presence of `@Test` annotations. The method in conflict is testing the behavior of a `processor` when processing an event, specifically checking if there are no updates or interactions with a `workspace` when certain conditions are met (in this case, when classes are not changed).

The conflict arises in the `shouldNotUpdateIfClassesAreNotChanged` test method. The two versions of this method are:

1. From `HEAD` (the current branch):
   ```java
void shouldNotUpdateIfClassesAreNotChanged() throws CoreException {
	assertDoesNotThrow(() -> processor.processEvent(emptyEvent()));
}
```

2. From `ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586` (the other branch being merged):
   ```java
public void shouldNotUpdateIfClassesAreNotChanged() throws CoreException {
	processor.processEvent(emptyEvent());

	verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
}
```

The `HEAD` version checks that processing an empty event does not throw an exception, using `assertDoesNotThrow`. However, it does not verify if there were any interactions with the `workspace`.

The other version (`ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586`) directly processes the event and then verifies that there were no interactions with the `workspace` using `verifyNoInteractions(workspace)`. This version also changes the method's access modifier from default (package-private) to `public`.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we should consider the intent behind both changes. The test method is checking two important aspects:
1. That processing an empty event does not throw an exception.
2. That processing an empty event results in no interactions with the `workspace`.

Both aspects are crucial for ensuring the `processor` behaves correctly under the given condition. Thus, the resolved version should ideally include both checks.

Here's a potential resolution that combines the intent of both versions:

```java
@Test
public void shouldNotUpdateIfClassesAreNotChanged() throws CoreException {
	assertDoesNotThrow(() -> processor.processEvent(emptyEvent()));
	verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
}
```

This version maintains the `public` access modifier, includes the check for exceptions using `assertDoesNotThrow`, and verifies that there are no interactions with the `workspace`.

Given this analysis, here is the entire snippet with the conflict resolved, presented in markdown code syntax:

```java

		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);		
	}

	@Test
	public void shouldNotUpdateIfClassesAreNotChanged() throws CoreException {
		assertDoesNotThrow(() -> processor.processEvent(emptyEvent()));
		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

	@Test
	void shouldRespondToPostBuildEvents() {
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, POST_BUILD, AUTO_BUILD, null);
```
