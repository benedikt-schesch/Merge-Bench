To resolve the merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```java
import com.restfb.types.DeviceCode;
import com.restfb.util.EncodingUtils;
import com.restfb.util.StringUtils;

import java.io.IOException;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;
=======
import java.util.*;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

/**
```

The conflict lies in the import statements for `java.util` packages. The local changes (`HEAD`) have explicitly imported specific classes from `java.util`, namely `ArrayList`, `Arrays`, `Collections`, and `List`. On the other hand, the incoming changes (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) have imported all classes from `java.util` using a wildcard (`*`).

Let's consider the intent and semantics of both sides:

1. The explicit import statements (`HEAD`) are typically used when you need to use specific classes from a package. This approach can make the code more readable by avoiding the use of fully qualified names for the imported classes. It also helps in avoiding potential naming conflicts.

2. The wildcard import (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) is a shorthand way to import all public classes from a package. This can clutter the namespace and potentially lead to naming conflicts, but it's convenient when many classes from the same package are being used.

To resolve the conflict, we need to decide whether to keep the explicit imports or switch to the wildcard import. 

Given that the explicit imports are already listing specific classes (`ArrayList`, `Arrays`, `Collections`, and `List`), and assuming these are the classes being used in the code (which isn't shown in the provided snippet), the most straightforward resolution is to merge the imports by keeping the explicit imports as they are and removing the conflict markers. However, if the rest of the code (not shown) uses other classes from `java.util`, it might be more convenient to use the wildcard import.

Since the intent is not entirely clear without the rest of the code and considering the potential for additional `java.util` classes being used, a safe resolution that preserves the explicitness of the original code and avoids potential naming conflicts or unnecessary imports would be to keep the explicit imports. But, we should also check if other classes from `java.util` are used.

To directly resolve the given conflict without assuming additional context:

```java
import com.restfb.types.DeviceCode;
import com.restfb.util.EncodingUtils;
import com.restfb.util.StringUtils;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

/**
```

This resolution keeps the explicit import statements as they were in `HEAD`, effectively ignoring the change brought in by `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`. If the code uses other `java.util` classes, the conflict resolution might need to be adjusted accordingly by either adding those classes to the explicit imports or switching to a wildcard import.
