To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of an Android application, given the imports of Android-related classes. The conflict arises from the import statements, where the `HEAD` (the local branch being merged into) and the other branch (`d28bc96faf3c28942720eaef1a486d601352d2d5`) have differing import statements.

The `HEAD` side imports `fr.xplod.focal.R;`, indicating a reference to a resource file (`R.java`) generated by the Android build process for the package `fr.xplod.focal`.

The other branch (`d28bc96faf3c28942720eaef1a486d601352d2d5`), on the other hand, imports `org.cyanogenmod.focal.R;` and `org.cyanogenmod.focal.Util;`, indicating a different package namespace (`org.cyanogenmod.focal`) and an additional utility class (`Util`).

The intent behind the `HEAD` side seems to be referencing resources and possibly other classes within the `fr.xplod.focal` package. The other branch appears to be updating or modifying the application to use a different package namespace (`org.cyanogenmod.focal`), likely as part of a rebranding or integration effort, and is also importing an additional utility class (`Util`).

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to consider the broader context of the merge. If the application is being rebranded or updated to use the `org.cyanogenmod.focal` package namespace, then the imports from the other branch are likely the correct choice. However, if the `fr.xplod.focal` namespace is still in use or if this merge is part of a more complex rebranding effort that hasn't fully transitioned to the new namespace, we need to be cautious.

Given the information, the most straightforward resolution, assuming the application has transitioned to the `org.cyanogenmod.focal` namespace, would be to adopt the imports from the other branch. However, we must ensure that all relevant parts of the codebase have been updated accordingly.

Here is the resolution in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
import android.util.Log;
import android.view.animation.AccelerateInterpolator;
import android.view.animation.DecelerateInterpolator;
import android.widget.FrameLayout;

import org.cyanogenmod.focal.R;
import org.cyanogenmod.focal.Util;
import org.cyanogenmod.focal.widgets.WidgetBase;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
```

This resolution assumes that the transition to `org.cyanogenmod.focal` is the intended state. If there's any ambiguity or if the broader context suggests otherwise, it might be safer to return the original conflicted snippet. However, based on the information provided and the nature of the changes, the above resolution seems reasonable.

If we were to return the conflict as is due to uncertainty, it would look like this:

```java
import android.util.Log;
import android.view.animation.AccelerateInterpolator;
import android.view.animation.DecelerateInterpolator;
import android.widget.FrameLayout;
