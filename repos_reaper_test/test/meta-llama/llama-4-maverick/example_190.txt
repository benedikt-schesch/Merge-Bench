To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a part of a Java class that appears to manage function registrations. The method `registerFunction` is used to register or deregister a function based on the provided `functionSpec`. The method takes two parameters: `function` (the alias of the function to be registered) and `functionSpec` (an object representing the function's specification, including its class name and constructor arguments).

The conflict arises from the differing types of the `functionSpec` parameter in the method signature.

1. The version from `HEAD` (the local branch) has the method signature `public void registerFunction(String function, String functionSpec)`.
2. The version from the commit `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` (the branch being merged) has the method signature `public void registerFunction(String function, FuncSpec functionSpec)`.

Let's analyze the changes and intents:
- The local branch (`HEAD`) treats `functionSpec` as a `String`, suggesting it might be passing or representing the function specification as a string, possibly a class name or a serialized form of the spec.
- The branch being merged (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) treats `functionSpec` as a `FuncSpec` object, indicating a more structured representation of the function's specification.

The method body is checking if `functionSpec` is `null` and, if so, removes the function from `definedFunctions`. Otherwise, it puts the `functionSpec` into `definedFunctions` with the `function` as the key.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the change in the type of `functionSpec`. If the change to `FuncSpec` is a refactoring that replaces a string representation with a more structured object, and this change is intended to be part of the merged code, then the method body should work with `FuncSpec`. However, the check for `null` remains valid.

Given this context, the resolution should align with the more structured and type-safe approach (`FuncSpec`) if that's the direction the code is moving towards. However, we must ensure that the change is consistent with the rest of the codebase and the logic of `definedFunctions`.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
     * @param function - the new function alias to define.
     * @param functionSpec - the FuncSpec object representing the name of 
     * the function class and any arguments to constructor.
     * 
     */
    public void registerFunction(String function, FuncSpec functionSpec) {
        if (functionSpec == null) {
            definedFunctions.remove(function);
        } else {
            definedFunctions.put(function, functionSpec);
        }

```

However, to follow the instructions precisely and return the entire snippet including the conflict markers if there's any ambiguity, we should first check if the resolution is clear.

Since I've decided on a resolution based on the available information, I'll directly provide the resolved code. If the intent was ambiguous or if I were unsure, I would return the original snippet with conflict markers.

The final answer is:
```java
     * @param function - the new function alias to define.
     * @param functionSpec - the FuncSpec object representing the name of 
     * the function class and any arguments to constructor.
     * 
     */
    public void registerFunction(String function, FuncSpec functionSpec) {
        if (functionSpec == null) {
            definedFunctions.remove(function);
        } else {
            definedFunctions.put(function, functionSpec);
        }
