To resolve this merge conflict, let's examine the code snippet provided and understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and involves import statements for various classes, primarily from the `java.util.jar` and `org.apache.pig` packages. The conflict arises in the import statements related to the `org.apache.pig` package.

On the left side of the conflict (HEAD), we have:
```java
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapreduceExec.PigMapReduce;
import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;
```

On the right side of the conflict (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309), we have:
```java
//import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapreduceExec.PigMapReduce;
import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.PigMapReduce;
```

Let's analyze the changes:
1. The import statement for `org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext` is present on both sides, so there's no conflict regarding this import.
2. The left side imports `PigMapReduce` from `mapreduceExec`, which suggests it's using a specific class related to Pig's MapReduce execution engine.
3. The right side has a commented-out version of the same import as the left side but introduces an import for `PigMapReduce` from `mapReduceLayer` instead. This indicates a potential refactoring or change in how `PigMapReduce` is being utilized or referenced.

The intent on the left side is to use `PigMapReduce` from `mapreduceExec`. The intent on the right side seems to be replacing or updating this to use `PigMapReduce` from `mapReduceLayer`, while temporarily commenting out the original import (possibly as a step in refactoring).

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent of both sides, we need to decide which `PigMapReduce` class is intended to be used. If the change on the right is a update or refactoring, we should consider removing the commented-out line and the unused import.

Given the context, the resolution could be to keep the import for `PigMapReduce` from `mapReduceLayer` as it seems to be the updated or preferred location, and remove the other related to `mapreduceExec`. The import for `PigContext` remains unchanged as it's common on both sides.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
import java.util.jar.JarEntry;
import java.util.jar.JarInputStream;
import java.util.jar.JarOutputStream;
import java.util.zip.ZipEntry;

import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.PigMapReduce;


public class JarManager {
