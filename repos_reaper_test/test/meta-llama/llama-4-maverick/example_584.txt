To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The given Java code snippet appears to be part of a class definition for `DebugTokenError`, which extends `AbstractFacebookType`. This suggests it's related to handling Facebook API-related errors, possibly within the context of debugging access tokens.

The conflict arises around the declaration of `serialVersionUID`, a version number used during the deserialization process to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes that are compatible with respect to serialization.

On one side of the merge (`HEAD`), there's a declaration of `serialVersionUID` with a value of `1L`. This indicates that the developers working on this branch intended to explicitly define the serialization version UID for the `DebugTokenError` class.

On the other side of the merge (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`), there's no declaration of `serialVersionUID`. This could imply that either the developers on this branch did not consider it necessary to explicitly define `serialVersionUID` or they intended to rely on the default serialization behavior.

To resolve this conflict, we should consider the intent behind including or omitting `serialVersionUID`. 

1. If `serialVersionUID` is explicitly defined (`1L` in this case), it means the class's serialization version is being controlled manually. This is a good practice, especially when the class is expected to be serialized and deserialized across different versions of the application or when it's part of a public API.

2. Omitting `serialVersionUID` allows the Java compiler to automatically generate one based on the class's structure. This can be acceptable if the class is not intended to be serialized across different versions or if the developers are aware that changes to the class could break serialization compatibility.

Given the information and focusing on the intent and semantics:

- Both versions of the code compile and run without immediate issues related to the presence or absence of `serialVersionUID`. 
- The version with `serialVersionUID` explicitly defined is more controlled in terms of serialization compatibility.

Since there's no clear indication that one intent is more correct than the other based on the provided context, and considering that `serialVersionUID` is generally a good practice for serializable classes, the conflict could be resolved by keeping the explicit definition of `serialVersionUID`. However, without more context on why one side omitted it, it's a decision based on the assumption that controlling serialization version is beneficial.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java

  }

  class DebugTokenError extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    @Facebook
    private Integer code;

    @Facebook
    private String message;
```
