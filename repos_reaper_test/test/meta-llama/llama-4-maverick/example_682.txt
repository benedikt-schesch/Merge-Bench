To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a Java method that handles the processing of ambiguous principals (users or groups) during the deployment of some configuration or data import. The conflict arises in the construction of a warning message when such ambiguities are detected.

### Understanding the Conflict

The conflict is within the construction of the `text` variable, which is a message to be displayed or logged when there are ambiguous principals. The message includes a list of the ambiguous principals and provides context about the issue and its implications.

### Analyzing the Changes

1. **Left Side (HEAD):**
   - The message text starts with "For the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for resource access permissions or node ownership during **deployment**."
   - It uses `String.join` to concatenate the list of ambiguous principals.
   - The sentence structure and wording are specific, emphasizing the impact on "resource access permissions or node ownership" and stating that "node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported" due to the ambiguity.

2. **Right Side (83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965):**
   - The message text is similar but refers to "grants or node ownership" instead of "resource access permissions or node ownership."
   - It sorts the `ambiguousPrincipals` list before joining them, ensuring the list is presented in a consistent order.
   - The punctuation at the end of the sentence before the list differs (exclamation mark `!` instead of a period `.`).

### Resolving the Conflict

To resolve this conflict, we should consider the intent behind the changes on both sides. The left side (HEAD) focuses on "resource access permissions," while the right side introduces a more general term, "grants." The right side also sorts the list of principals, which is a good practice for consistency. The rest of the message is largely similar, with minor differences in punctuation and wording.

Given the information and focusing on the semantics:

- The right side's use of "grants" is more general and potentially more inclusive of different types of permissions or accesses, which could be considered an improvement or a necessary change depending on the context.
- Sorting the list of ambiguous principals is a beneficial change for readability and consistency.

Therefore, a reasonable resolution could involve taking the changes from the right side, as they seem to refine the message and improve the presentation of the list.

### Code Resolution

```java
			}

			if (!ambiguousPrincipals.isEmpty()) {

				final String title = "Ambiguous Principal(s)";
				final String text = "For the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for grants or node ownership during <b>deployment</b>.<br>"
						+ "Because of this ambiguity, <b>node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported</b>!"
						+ "<ul><li>" + ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>")) + "</li></ul>"
						+ "Consider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.";

				logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
						+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
```
