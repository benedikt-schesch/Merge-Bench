To resolve the merge conflict in the given Java code snippet, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The conflict is in this line:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
            CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, maxurilength, maximagesize);            
=======
            CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, uriLength);
>>>>>>> 790b69a0bd40e3ab536f9c6568748f981b3d525e
```
The left side (HEAD) is creating a new `CSSURLEmbedder` object with five parameters: `in`, `options`, `verbose`, `maxurilength`, and `maximagesize`. The right side is creating a `CSSURLEmbedder` object with four parameters: `in`, `options`, `verbose`, and `uriLength`.

To understand the intent, we need to consider what changes are being made on both sides. The left side includes two parameters (`maxurilength` and `maximagesize`) that are related to URI length and image size, respectively. The right side, however, only includes one parameter (`uriLength`), suggesting a potential simplification or change in how URI length is handled.

Without additional context about the `CSSURLEmbedder` class and its constructor(s), we can infer the following:
1. The `CSSURLEmbedder` class has undergone a change in its constructor. The change involves either removing or renaming parameters.
2. The left side (HEAD) is using an older or different version of the `CSSURLEmbedder` constructor that accepts five parameters.
3. The right side is using a newer or different version of the constructor that accepts four parameters, with `uriLength` potentially corresponding to or replacing `maxurilength`.

To resolve the conflict, we should consider the intent behind both changes:
- If the change on the right side is to simplify or modify the constructor to no longer require `maximagesize`, and `uriLength` is the new or updated parameter for controlling URI length, then the resolution should align with this change.
- However, if `maxurilength` and `maximagesize` are both crucial and have been used correctly on the left side, and there's no indication that they are deprecated or replaced, then simply taking the right side's change could result in losing functionality or configuration options.

Given the information, a straightforward resolution isn't clear without knowing the specifics of the `CSSURLEmbedder` class and the implications of its constructor changes. 

However, we can attempt a resolution based on parameter names and assuming the right side's change is valid and intended to simplify or update the constructor. If `uriLength` corresponds to `maxurilength`, and assuming `maximagesize` is either deprecated or no longer needed, the code on the right side could be considered correct if it aligns with the updated `CSSURLEmbedder` constructor.

Thus, here is the code snippet with the conflict resolved by taking the right side's version (assuming it's the intended or updated version), in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
            boolean skipMissingFiles = parser.getOptionValue(skipMissingOpt) != null;
            if(skipMissingFiles) {
                options = options | CSSURLEmbedder.SKIP_MISSING_OPTION;
            }
            
            CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, uriLength);
            embedder.setMHTMLRoot(mhtmlRoot);
            
            //close in case writing to the same file
            in.close(); in = null;
            
```

However, if unsure or if the intent is ambiguous due to lack of context about the `CSSURLEmbedder` class and its usage, the correct approach would be to return the original snippet with the conflict, as is:

```java
            boolean skipMissingFiles = parser.getOptionValue(skipMissingOpt) != null;
            if(skipMissingFiles) {
                options = options | CSSURLEmbedder.SKIP_MISSING_OPTION;
            }
            
<<<<<<< HEAD
            CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, maxurilength, maximagesize);            
=======
            CSSURLEmbedder embedder = new CSSURLEmbedder(in, options, verbose, uriLength);
>>>>>>> 790b69a0bd40e3ab536f9c6568748f981b3d525e
            embedder.setMHTMLRoot(mhtmlRoot);
            
            //close in case writing to the same file
            in.close(); in = null;
            
```
