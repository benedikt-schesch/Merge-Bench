To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the intent and semantics behind both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a larger class, likely used in a music application given the context of playlists, loved items, and starred albums/artists.

Let's analyze the conflicting parts:

- The `HEAD` side of the conflict includes explicit calls to fetch various data:
  ```java
  fetchPlaylists();
  fetchLovedItemsPlaylist();
  fetchStarredAlbums();
  fetchStarredArtists();
  ```
  This suggests that the code is manually triggering the fetching of different types of data related to the user's music library or profile.

- The other side of the conflict (identified by the commit hash `760cca9f756c8b759aadcc9e3b67508946d2b173`) includes a single call:
  ```java
  fetchAll();
  ```
  This implies that `fetchAll()` is a method that encapsulates the fetching of all relevant data, potentially including playlists, loved items, starred albums, and starred artists.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both versions. If `fetchAll()` is designed to fetch all the data that the individual `fetch*()` methods are fetching, and it does so in a manner that is consistent with the application's requirements (e.g., performance, data consistency), then using `fetchAll()` could be a more concise and potentially more efficient way to achieve the same result.

However, if `fetchAll()` does not exactly replicate the behavior of the individual fetch calls (for example, if it fetches additional data not needed here, or if it has different error handling), then the explicit calls might be preferable.

Given the information available, `fetchAll()` seems to be the more modern or refactored approach, potentially simplifying the code and improving maintainability. If it is confirmed that `fetchAll()` covers the functionality of the individual fetch methods, the conflict can be resolved by choosing the `fetchAll()` call.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
        addCollection(new UserCollection());
        addCollection(new HatchetCollection());

        ensureLovedItemsPlaylist();
        updatePlaylists();
        fetchAll();

        TomahawkApp.getContext().registerReceiver(mCollectionManagerReceiver,
                new IntentFilter(InfoSystem.INFOSYSTEM_RESULTSREPORTED));
        TomahawkApp.getContext().registerReceiver(mCollectionManagerReceiver,
                new IntentFilter(InfoSystem.INFOSYSTEM_OPLOGISEMPTIED));
```
