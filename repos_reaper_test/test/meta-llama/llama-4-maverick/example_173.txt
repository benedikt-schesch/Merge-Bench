To resolve this merge conflict, let's first analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is defining a class `GFAny` that extends `EvalFunc`. The conflict arises in the type parameter of `EvalFunc`. On one side (`HEAD`), it's `DataAtom`, and on the other side (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`), it's `Integer`.

The class `GFAny` is described as a "built-in grouping function; permits system to choose any grouping." This indicates that `GFAny` is likely used for determining or generating groups within some data processing or analytical framework.

1. **Understanding `EvalFunc<DataAtom>`**: When `GFAny` extends `EvalFunc<DataAtom>`, it implies that the evaluation function returns a `DataAtom`. `DataAtom` could represent a basic or atomic unit of data in the system. This suggests that the function's purpose is related to processing or evaluating data at this atomic level.

2. **Understanding `EvalFunc<Integer>`**: When `GFAny` extends `EvalFunc<Integer>`, it implies that the evaluation function returns an `Integer`. Given the context that this class is related to grouping, returning an `Integer` could indicate that the function is returning a group identifier or a count related to grouping.

The presence of `defaultNumGroups`, `numGroups`, and a `Random` object (`r`) within the class suggests that the class is involved in randomly assigning or determining the number of groups. The return type being `Integer` could make sense if it's returning a group ID. However, the return type being `DataAtom` is less directly related to the obvious grouping semantics unless `DataAtom` is being used to represent group information in a more abstract or encapsulated manner.

Without more context about how `GFAny` is used or the specifics of `DataAtom` and the evaluation function (`EvalFunc`), it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict based solely on the semantics and intent.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the information given and typical use cases for such classes. If `GFAny` is about grouping and the presence of `numGroups` and a random number generator, it seems plausible that the class is intended to return a group identifier, which would be an `Integer`. This aligns with the idea of grouping data into a certain number of categories or buckets.

Given this analysis, the conflict resolution would lean towards choosing `EvalFunc<Integer>` if we believe the primary function of `GFAny` is to return a group identifier or a count. However, without explicit information about the expected return type or how `DataAtom` relates to grouping, this is not a definitive resolution.

To preserve the original context and spacing, and considering the potential ambiguity in the intent, the snippet with the conflict is returned as is:
