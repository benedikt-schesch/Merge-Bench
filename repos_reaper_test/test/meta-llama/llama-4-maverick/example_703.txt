To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the provided code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The given code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class, likely within an Android application given the presence of `AsyncTask` and `AutoResetProgressDialog`. The snippet includes several member variables with different types and purposes.

The conflict arises between the lines marked by `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> 5b113d182581d1ed140bc7768a508344f19d7d6e`. The code between these markers indicates that on one branch (HEAD), there are additional member variables declared: `last_search_string`, `last_found_position`, and `translucent_yellow`, along with a comment and the declaration of `mLoadingCommentsProgress`. On the other branch (`5b113d182581d1ed140bc7768a508344f19d7d6e`), these declarations are not present.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes on both sides.

1. The changes on the HEAD side introduce new member variables that seem to be related to search functionality (`last_search_string`, `last_found_position`) and a color or resource (`translucent_yellow`). Additionally, there's a declaration for `mLoadingCommentsProgress`, which is related to displaying a progress dialog.

2. The other side (`5b113d182581d1ed140bc7768a508344f19d7d6e`) does not include these declarations, suggesting either that these features or variables were not implemented in this branch, or they were removed.

Given the information, the resolution depends on whether the features related to the introduced variables on the HEAD side are required in the merged code. 

If the intent is to include the search functionality and the progress dialog, and assuming `translucent_yellow` is related to the application's UI, the changes from HEAD should be retained. If these features are not needed or were intentionally removed in the other branch, then the changes from `5b113d182581d1ed140bc7768a508344f19d7d6e` should be kept.

However, without additional context about the application's requirements or the specific changes made in each branch, the safest approach is to return the original snippet with the conflict, as the intent might be ambiguous.

```java
    private String mEditTargetBody = null;
    private String mDeleteTargetKind = null;
    private boolean mShouldClearReply = false;
    private AsyncTask<?, ?, ?> mCurrentDownloadCommentsTask = null;
    private final Object mCurrentDownloadCommentsTaskLock = new Object();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private String last_search_string;
    private int last_found_position = -1;
    private int translucent_yellow;
    // ProgressDialogs with percentage bars
    private AutoResetProgressDialog mLoadingCommentsProgress;
