To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The given code snippet is in Java and appears to be a list of import statements for various example classes from the `org.andengine.examples` package. The conflict arises between the local changes (represented by `HEAD`) and the changes from another branch or commit (represented by the commit hash `ebfa99cecacf6a332de1194dca867b8b96fb640d`).

On the `HEAD` side, we have imports for `PolygonExample` and `TextExample`. On the other side of the merge (the one being merged into `HEAD`), there are no imports added or removed in the conflicting region; essentially, the conflict is about whether to keep `PolygonExample` and `TextExample` or not.

Let's analyze the intent:
- The `HEAD` side includes `PolygonExample` and `TextExample`, suggesting that these examples are relevant or needed in the context of the code being worked on.
- The other side (`ebfa99cecacf6a332de1194dca867b8b96fb640d`) does not include these imports, which could mean either they are not necessary, or their inclusion is not relevant to the changes being merged.

Since there's no indication that `PolygonExample` and `TextExample` are being removed or are unnecessary from the context provided, and assuming that both sides of the merge are valid in their own right, we need to consider the overall intent.

The conflict is essentially about deciding whether the examples `PolygonExample` and `TextExample` should be included.

Given the information and focusing on the semantics and intent, it seems reasonable to preserve the imports on both sides as they are, assuming they serve a purpose. However, directly resolving this requires understanding if `PolygonExample` and `TextExample` are needed alongside the other examples.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent and semantics:
```java
import org.andengine.examples.AnimatedSpritesExample;
import org.andengine.examples.AutoParallaxBackgroundExample;
import org.andengine.examples.BitmapFontExample;
import org.andengine.examples.BoundCameraExample;
import org.andengine.examples.CanvasTextureCompositingExample;
import org.andengine.examples.PolygonExample;
import org.andengine.examples.TextExample;
import org.andengine.examples.CollisionDetectionExample;
import org.andengine.examples.ColorKeyTextureSourceDecoratorExample;
import org.andengine.examples.CoordinateConversionExample;
import org.andengine.examples.CustomFontExample;
import org.andengine.examples.DigitalOnScreenControlExample;
```
This resolution keeps `PolygonExample` and `TextExample` as they are part of the `HEAD` changes, assuming their inclusion is intentional and relevant.

The final snippet in markdown code syntax, unchanged in context and spacing, with the conflict resolved:
