To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a larger application, likely JBake, a static site generator. The imports are listed, which include various classes from Apache Commons, JBake itself, and SLF4J for logging.

The conflict arises from the fact that the local branch (`HEAD`) has an import statement for `org.jbake.template.model.TemplateModel`, while the other branch (`d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb`) does not have this import.

Let's examine the intent behind both changes:

1. **Local Branch (`HEAD`):** The presence of the import for `TemplateModel` suggests that the code in this branch uses `TemplateModel` somewhere. The import is necessary for the compilation of the class that uses `TemplateModel`.

2. **Other Branch (`d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb`):** The absence of the import for `TemplateModel` could mean that this branch either does not use `TemplateModel` or has removed its usage. Alternatively, it's possible that the usage and import were removed or were never present in this branch.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to understand the functionality both branches are trying to achieve and how `TemplateModel` fits into this.

- If `TemplateModel` is used in the code within the local branch and its usage is correct and necessary, then the import should be retained. 
- If the other branch has correctly removed the usage of `TemplateModel` (or never had it), and the removal is valid (e.g., due to refactoring or a change in requirements), then the import should be removed.

Without the actual code that uses (or doesn't use) `TemplateModel`, it's challenging to make a definitive decision. However, a general approach would be to check if `TemplateModel` is used in the class. If it is, the import should be kept; otherwise, it can be removed.

Since we cannot see the rest of the code and assuming that the conflict is solely due to the import statement, we will return the snippet as is, preserving the conflict markers, as we cannot be certain of the intent without more context.
