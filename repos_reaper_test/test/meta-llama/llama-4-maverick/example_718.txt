To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a method that extracts entities (specifically mentions) from a given text. It uses regular expressions to match valid mentions or lists and then further validates these matches to ensure they are not followed by certain characters that would invalidate them.

The conflict arises in the `if` condition inside the `while` loop, where the code checks the text after a matched mention to determine if it's valid.

On the `HEAD` side (the local changes), the code checks if the text after a match does not contain a pattern that matches the end of a screen name (`Regex.SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END`). If it doesn't, the matched text is considered a valid mention and is added to the `extracted` list as an `Entity` of type `EntityType.MENTION`.

On the other side of the merge (represented by the commit `241013e46597fb285a334c966dfa7af9991b5225`), the code checks if the text after a match does not contain a pattern that matches the end of an invalid mention (`Regex.INVALID_MENTION_MATCH_END`). If it doesn't, the matched text is considered valid and is added to the `extracted` list as an `Entity` but with the type specified as `"mention"` (a string literal) and the group index for extracting the username from the match is `Regex.VALID_MENTION_OR_LIST_GROUP_USERNAME`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. The `HEAD` side seems to be focused on validating the mention based on what follows it using `Regex.SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END`, while the other side introduces a check using `Regex.INVALID_MENTION_MATCH_END` and changes the entity type to a string literal `"mention"` and uses a potentially different group index for extracting the username.

The key here is to understand if `Regex.SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END` and `Regex.INVALID_MENTION_MATCH_END` serve the same purpose or if they are checking for different conditions. If they are checking for the same or similar conditions (i.e., validating the end of a mention), and if the entity type `EntityType.MENTION` is equivalent to or can be represented by the string `"mention"`, then we need to decide which validation is more appropriate or if both are needed.

However, without more context about `Regex.SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END` and `Regex.INVALID_MENTION_MATCH_END`, and the implications of using `EntityType.MENTION` versus `"mention"`, it's challenging to make an informed decision.

Given the information available, the most straightforward resolution would be to choose one side of the changes based on the intent of the merge. However, since the intents seem slightly different and without knowing the exact definitions of `Regex.SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END` and `Regex.INVALID_MENTION_MATCH_END`, I'll proceed with caution.

Let's analyze the potential resolutions:

1. **Choosing the `HEAD` side**: This involves sticking with `Regex.SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END` and `EntityType.MENTION`.
2. **Choosing the other side**: This means using `Regex.INVALID_MENTION_MATCH_END`, the string `"mention"`, and `Regex.VALID_MENTION_OR_LIST_GROUP_USERNAME`.

If we assume that both `Regex.SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END` and `Regex.INVALID_MENTION_MATCH_END` are intended to validate the mention in a similar context, and considering the change in entity type representation and the group index used, the resolution might involve picking the more updated or relevant validation logic.

However, the safest approach, given the potential ambiguity and without further context, is to return the original snippet with the conflict, as it is:

```java

    List<Entity> extracted = new ArrayList<Entity>();
    Matcher matcher = Regex.VALID_MENTION_OR_LIST.matcher(text);
    while (matcher.find()) {
      String after = text.substring(matcher.end());
<<<<<<< HEAD
      if (! Regex.SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END.matcher(after).find()) {
        extracted.add(new Entity(matcher, EntityType.MENTION, Regex.EXTRACT_MENTIONS_GROUP_USERNAME));
=======
      if (! Regex.INVALID_MENTION_MATCH_END.matcher(after).find()) {
        extracted.add(new Entity(matcher, "mention", Regex.VALID_MENTION_OR_LIST_GROUP_USERNAME));
>>>>>>> 241013e46597fb285a334c966dfa7af9991b5225
      }
    }
    return extracted;
  }
