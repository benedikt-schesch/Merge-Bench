To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a game logic implementation. It checks certain conditions related to a game state and a player's turn, returning specific error codes based on those conditions.

The merge conflict arises from the difference between the two versions of the code:
- The `HEAD` version (local changes) contains a comment indicating that a certain condition shouldn't ever happen but includes a check for `player` being not `null` followed by resetting its skip count.
- The version from the commit `1849588bf7a3cbba44434ff5348b02aa114415ba` (incoming changes) does not include the comment but presumably includes the same or similar logic for handling `player`, though the exact changes are not directly visible in the conflict snippet.

However, upon closer inspection, we see that the conflict is actually about whether to keep a comment or not. The code related to `player` is not in conflict; it's just that the `HEAD` version has a comment, and the incoming change removes this comment.

The intent seems to be checking if `player` is not `null` before calling `resetSkipCount()` on it, which is present in both versions. The comment in the `HEAD` version is just that—a comment—and doesn't affect the logic.

Since the actual code change (the `if (null != player)` block) is not in conflict, and the conflict is merely about the presence of a comment, we can resolve this by understanding that comments are not crucial to the functionality.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent and semantics, we should look at what's being commented out or added. Here, we can simply remove the conflict markers and decide whether to keep the comment or not.

Let's analyze:
- The comment is not essential for the functionality; it's more of a developer note.
- Both versions seem to agree on the `if (null != player)` check.

Given the information and focusing on the functionality, removing the conflict markers and deciding on the comment is the next step.

Here's the resolution, keeping the original context and code intact, and returning it in markdown code syntax:

```java
        return ErrorCode.NOT_JUDGE;
      } else if (state != GameState.JUDGING) {
        return ErrorCode.NOT_YOUR_TURN;
      }

      // shouldn't ever happen, but just in case...
      if (null != player) {
        player.resetSkipCount();
      }

      cardPlayer = playedCards.getPlayerForId(cardId);
```
