To resolve the merge conflict provided in the Java code snippet, let's first examine the context and the conflicting changes.


The code snippet is as follows:
```java
            });
        }
        mapReference.set(mapBuilder.createPersistedTo(mapFile));
        try (ExternalMapQueryContext<Integer, Integer, ?> c = mapReference.get().queryContext(KEY)) {
            c.writeLock().lock();
<<<<<<< HEAD
            Thread.sleep(30_000);
=======
            Thread.sleep(8_000);
>>>>>>> 67b612c2568b82917bb090cac5046a34462e9d24
        }
    }

    private static ChronicleMapBuilder<Integer, Integer> createMapBuilder() {
        return ChronicleMapBuilder
```


The conflict arises from the different values used in `Thread.sleep()` in the two versions being merged. The local version (`HEAD`) has `Thread.sleep(30_000)`, indicating a pause of 30 seconds, while the version being merged (`67b612c2568b82917bb090cac5046a34462e9d24`) has `Thread.sleep(8_000)`, indicating a pause of 8 seconds.


To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the `Thread.sleep()` call. Generally, `Thread.sleep()` is used for pausing the execution of the current thread for a specified amount of time. The significant difference between 8 seconds and 30 seconds suggests different expectations or requirements for how long the thread should be paused.


Without additional context on why the thread is being paused (e.g., waiting for some operation to complete, simulating a delay, or throttling), it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict based solely on the semantic intent.


However, we can consider a few approaches to resolve the conflict:


1. **Check the Commit History and Messages**: Understanding the purpose behind the changes in both commits can provide insights. If the change to `8_000` was made to reduce the wait time due to some performance or responsiveness issue, and if the original `30_000` was necessary for some operational reason, we would need to weigh these considerations.


2. **Analyze the Surrounding Code**: The use of `c.writeLock().lock()` suggests that the code is holding a write lock on a Chronicle Map. Pausing the thread while holding this lock could have significant implications for the concurrency and performance of the application. A shorter or longer pause might be more or less desirable based on the specific requirements and constraints of the application.


3. **Consider the Implications of Each Choice**: 
    - Choosing `30_000` (30 seconds) might be necessary if the operation that follows requires a longer setup or preparation time, or if it's waiting for an external operation to complete.
    - Choosing `8_000` (8 seconds) might indicate an optimization or a reduction in the wait time, possibly due to a change in the external dependency or an improvement in the operation's responsiveness.


Since the intent behind the `Thread.sleep()` duration is not explicitly clear from the provided snippet, and without further context on the requirements or constraints of the application, a definitive resolution cannot be made with certainty.


Therefore, the original snippet with the conflict is returned unchanged, as is:


```java
            });
        }
        mapReference.set(mapBuilder.createPersistedTo(mapFile));
        try (ExternalMapQueryContext<Integer, Integer, ?> c = mapReference.get().queryContext(KEY)) {
            c.writeLock().lock();
<<<<<<< HEAD
            Thread.sleep(30_000);
=======
            Thread.sleep(8_000);
>>>>>>> 67b612c2568b82917bb090cac5046a34462e9d24
        }
    }

    private static ChronicleMapBuilder<Integer, Integer> createMapBuilder() {
        return ChronicleMapBuilder
```
