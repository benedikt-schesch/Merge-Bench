To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the code snippet and understand the intent of both sides of the merge.

The conflict is in the line where the `isMultiQuery` variable is assigned a value. Both sides of the merge are checking a property to determine if multi-query is enabled, but they are using different property names.

The left-hand side (HEAD) is using `PigConfiguration.OPT_MULTIQUERY` as the property name, which suggests that it is using a constant defined in `PigConfiguration` class.

The right-hand side (1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81) is using a hardcoded string `"opt.multiquery"` as the property name.

Upon closer inspection, it seems that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - to check if multi-query is enabled. The difference lies in how they are accessing the property name.

To resolve this conflict, we need to determine which property name is correct or if both are valid. 

`PigConfiguration.OPT_MULTIQUERY` seems to be a more robust and maintainable way to access the property name as it is using a constant. However, without knowing the actual value of `PigConfiguration.OPT_MULTIQUERY`, we cannot be certain if it matches with `"opt.multiquery"`.

Assuming `PigConfiguration.OPT_MULTIQUERY` is equal to `"opt.multiquery"`, the left-hand side is more maintainable. 

Let's preserve the context and the spacing as is and resolve the conflict.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
        // splits.
        NoopFilterRemover fRem = new NoopFilterRemover(plan);
        fRem.visit();

        boolean isMultiQuery =
            "true".equalsIgnoreCase(pc.getProperties().getProperty(PigConfiguration.OPT_MULTIQUERY, "true"));

        if (isMultiQuery) {
            // reduces the number of MROpers in the MR plan generated
            // by multi-query (multi-store) script.
            MultiQueryOptimizer mqOptimizer = new MultiQueryOptimizer(plan, pc.inIllustrator);
```
