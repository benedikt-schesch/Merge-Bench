To resolve this merge conflict, we need to analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that has a `toString()` method. This method checks if the application is running as a native image and, if so, appends `-graalvm` to the version string.

The conflict arises from two different ways of checking the `imageCode` property.

On the left-hand side (`HEAD`), the code uses `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY` and `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME` to check the `imageCode` property. These are likely constants defined elsewhere in the code.

On the right-hand side (`1055ff5de3675837270f9739454829ed0cc14cec`), the code uses hardcoded string literals `"org.graalvm.nativeimage.imagecode"` and `"runtime"` to check the `imageCode` property.

To resolve this conflict, we need to determine which approach is more appropriate. 

Upon closer inspection, it seems that both sides are achieving the same goal, which is to check if the application is running as a native image. The difference lies in how the property key and value are defined.

Since the right-hand side is using hardcoded string literals that are likely the actual values of the constants used on the left-hand side, we can infer that the intent is to check the `imageCode` property with the specific key and value.

However, the left-hand side is using constants, which is generally a better practice as it makes the code more readable and maintainable.

To resolve the conflict in a way that preserves the intent and semantics of both sides, we should check if the constants on the left-hand side have the same values as the hardcoded string literals on the right-hand side.

Assuming they do, the resolved code should be consistent with the coding practices used in the rest of the project. 

Let's assume `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY` equals `"org.graalvm.nativeimage.imagecode"` and `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME` equals `"runtime"`, then both versions are semantically equivalent.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict resolved, preserving the original context and spacing:
```java
    }

    public String toString() {
      // When running the application as a native image, append `-graalvm` to the
      // version.
      String imageCode = System.getProperty(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY);
      if (imageCode != null && imageCode.equals(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME)){
        String[] tokens = versionString.split(" ");
        if (tokens.length > 0 && tokens[0].startsWith("gl-java")) {
          tokens[0] += "-graalvm";
          return Joiner.on(" ").join(tokens);
        }

```
