To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that overrides a method `getPosition()` from a possibly media-related interface or abstract class. The method is intended to return the current position of a media player.

The conflict arises in the `getPosition()` method where two different versions of the code are presented:

1. The version from `HEAD` (the current branch):
   ```java
   MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
   if (sMediaPlayer != null)
       return sMediaPlayer.getCurrentPosition();
   ```

2. The version from the commit `ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66` (the branch being merged):
   ```java
   if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
       return sMediaPlayer.getCurrentPosition();
   }
   ```

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes.

- The `HEAD` version introduces a line to retrieve a `MediaPlayer` object (`sMediaPlayer`) from a map (`mMediaPlayers`) using a key (`mPreparedQuery`). It then checks if `sMediaPlayer` is not null before returning its current position.

- The version being merged (`ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66`) assumes `sMediaPlayer` is already defined and directly checks if it's not null before returning its current position.

The key difference here is the declaration and initialization of `sMediaPlayer`. The `HEAD` version defines and initializes it, while the other version assumes it's already defined.

To resolve the conflict semantically, we need to ensure that both intents are preserved. The intent of the `HEAD` version is to correctly retrieve `sMediaPlayer` before checking its null status, while the intent of the other version is to correctly return the current position if `sMediaPlayer` is not null, with proper bracketing for the if condition.

The resolution involves combining these intents: declaring and initializing `sMediaPlayer` as in the `HEAD` version, and then checking if it's not null with proper bracketing as in the other version.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
        }
    }

    @Override
    public long getPosition() {
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            return sMediaPlayer.getCurrentPosition();
        }
        return 0;
    }
