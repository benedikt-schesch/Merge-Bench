To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides.

The method in question is `exceptionForTypeAndMessage`, which is supposed to return a `FacebookException` based on certain parameters. The context suggests that it's part of a mechanism to handle Facebook-related exceptions.

On the left-hand side (HEAD), the method takes a single parameter `container` of type `ExceptionInformation`, which presumably encapsulates all the necessary data to create a `FacebookException`. The comment above the method indicates that this `container` includes all data needed to create the associated `FacebookException`.

On the right-hand side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe), the method takes multiple parameters: `errorCode`, `errorSubcode`, `httpStatusCode`, `type`, `message`, `userTitle`, `userMessage`, `isTransient`, and `rawError`. These parameters seem to represent detailed information about the error that occurred.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions. The left-hand side suggests a more encapsulated approach, where the details of the exception are bundled into an `ExceptionInformation` object. The right-hand side, on the other hand, explicitly lists out the parameters that are presumably used to create a `FacebookException`, suggesting a more explicit and possibly more flexible approach.

However, without knowing the exact implementation or the context in which `ExceptionInformation` is used, it's challenging to definitively resolve this conflict. 

If we consider the possibility that `ExceptionInformation` might encapsulate the detailed error information (like `errorCode`, `errorSubcode`, etc.), the two approaches might not be mutually exclusive. But the right-hand side explicitly lists out parameters that might not be directly mapped to the properties or methods of `ExceptionInformation`.

Given the information, a straightforward resolution isn't clear. The conflict seems to be between two different design approaches: one that uses a container object and another that uses explicit parameters.

Since the intent is not entirely clear and to avoid potentially altering the functionality or semantics intended by either side of the merge, the most prudent approach is to return the snippet as is, with the conflict markers.

```java
   * 
   * @param container
   *          container for all data needed to create the associated {@see FacebookException}
   * @return An appropriate {@code FacebookException} subclass.
