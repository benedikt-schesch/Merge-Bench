To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a Java method `removeSpectator` that removes a spectator from a game. The method includes a JavaDoc comment that describes its purpose and the synchronization mechanism it uses.

The conflict arises in the JavaDoc comment, where the synchronization target is described differently on both sides of the merge:

- The `HEAD` side indicates that the method synchronizes on `#spectator`.
- The other side (`5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a`) suggests that the synchronization is on `#spectators`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the synchronization and the likely correct variable being synchronized on.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The method `removeSpectator` is removing a spectator from the game, implying that it is modifying a collection or list of spectators. Synchronization is used to prevent concurrent modifications.

2. **Analyzing the Variables**:
   - `#spectator` could imply a single spectator object, which doesn't seem to be the correct target for synchronization when removing a spectator from a collection.
   - `#spectators` suggests a collection or list of spectators, which is a more plausible target for synchronization when modifying the list of spectators in a multi-threaded environment.

3. **Resolving the Conflict**: Given the context and the likely intent of synchronizing on a collection of spectators to prevent concurrent modification, the correct synchronization target is probably `#spectators`. The method is removing a spectator (singular) from a collection of spectators (plural), so it makes sense to synchronize on the collection (`#spectators`) rather than a single spectator (`#spectator`).

Therefore, the resolved code snippet, preserving the original context and spacing, and formatted in markdown code syntax, is:

```java
  }

  /**
   * Remove a spectator from the game.
   * <br/>
   * Synchronizes on {@link #spectators}.
   *
   * @param user Spectator to remove from the game.
   */
  public void removeSpectator(final User user) {
    logger.info(String.format("Removing spectator %s from game %d.", user.toString(), id));
```
