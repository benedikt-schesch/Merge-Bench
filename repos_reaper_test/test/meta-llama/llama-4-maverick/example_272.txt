To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the conflict.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a larger system that involves data processing or a similar domain, given the presence of classes like `POPackage`, `LitePackager`, and `PhysicalPlan`. The conflict is within the lines related to setting the key type for a `LitePackager` instance (`pkgr`).

The conflicting lines are:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
        pkgr.setKeyType((fields == null || fields.length > 1) ? DataType.TUPLE : keyType);
=======
        pkgr.setKeyType((fields == null || fields.length > 1) ? DataType.TUPLE
                : keyType);
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a
```

Let's analyze the changes:

1. **Left side (HEAD):** The line is a straightforward conditional expression that checks if `fields` is `null` or if its length is more than 1. If true, it sets the key type to `DataType.TUPLE`; otherwise, it uses the `keyType` variable. The expression is on a single line.

2. **Right side (88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a):** The change here is purely formatting. The same conditional expression is used, but it's formatted across two lines for better readability.

Both sides of the merge conflict are semantically equivalent; they achieve the same result. The difference is purely in code formatting. 

Since the intent is the same on both sides, and given that code formatting is the only difference, we can resolve this by choosing one of the formats. The right side's formatting is more readable due to its line break, which is a common convention for improving readability in cases where a line is too long.

Therefore, the resolved snippet, preserving the original context and spacing, is:

```java
        }

        POPackage pkg = new POPackage(new OperatorKey(scope,
                nig.getNextNodeId(scope)));
        LitePackager pkgr = new LitePackager();
        pkgr.setKeyType((fields == null || fields.length > 1) ? DataType.TUPLE
                : keyType);
        pkg.setPkgr(pkgr);
        pkg.setNumInps(1);
        mro.reducePlan.add(pkg);

        PhysicalPlan ep = new PhysicalPlan();
```
