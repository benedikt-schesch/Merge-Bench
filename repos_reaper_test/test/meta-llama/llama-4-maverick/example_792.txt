To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class handling network connections or channels, given the presence of `Channels.close(c)` and a `cleanup(c)` method. The snippet includes a logging section where it handles exceptions and then decides whether to close a channel (`c`) or perform cleanup based on its state.

The merge conflict arises in the `if (c.isOpen())` block. Let's examine the changes:

- The left side of the conflict (`HEAD`) simply calls `Channels.close(c);` when the channel is open.
- The right side (`d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`) also calls `Channels.close(c);` but includes a comment indicating that this action will trigger `channelClosed()`, which in turn will perform cleanup. It also includes an `else` clause that explicitly calls `cleanup(c)` when the channel is not open, assuming this is due to a connection timeout.

Both sides of the merge conflict are semantically similar in that they close the channel when it's open. However, the right side provides additional context through comments and includes an explicit cleanup call when the channel is not open.

To resolve this conflict, we need to determine if the additional logic and comments on the right side (`d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`) are necessary or if the simpler version on the left (`HEAD`) is sufficient.

Given that the code on both sides of the conflict within the `if (c.isOpen())` block is identical (`Channels.close(c);`), and the right side adds an `else` clause with a comment explaining the reasoning behind calling `cleanup(c)` directly when the channel is not open, it seems the intent is to handle both scenarios: cleanup after closing an open channel (through `channelClosed()` triggered by `Channels.close(c)`) and direct cleanup when the channel is not open (presumably due to a timeout).

Therefore, the resolution should preserve the logic and comments from the right side, as it provides a more comprehensive handling of the channel's state.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
               + " ignore this if we're shutting down", e);
    } else {
      LOG.error("Unexpected exception from downstream on " + c, e);
    }
    if (c.isOpen()) {
      Channels.close(c);  // Will trigger channelClosed(), which will cleanup()
    } else {              // else: presumably a connection timeout.
      cleanup(c);         // => need to cleanup() from here directly.
    }
  }
