To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the intent behind both versions of the code.

The given Java code snippet defines several static properties related to notifications (success and failure) that are part of a built-in schema. These properties seem to be used for configuring notifications after the execution of certain actions. The properties are defined with specific hints and some have default values.

The conflict arises with the `successNotificationsDelayProperty`. The version from `HEAD` (the local branch) includes a property definition for `successNotificationsDelayProperty` with a hint and a default value of 5000, which suggests a delay in milliseconds before hiding success notifications. The other version (from `d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5`) simply omits this property.

To resolve the conflict, we should consider whether the `successNotificationsDelayProperty` is necessary or if it has been intentionally removed in the other branch. 

1. **Intent Analysis**: The presence of `successNotificationsDelayProperty` in `HEAD` suggests that there is a functionality or requirement to control the delay before hiding success notifications. Its absence in the other branch (`d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5`) could mean that this functionality is either not needed or has been superseded by another mechanism.

2. **Resolution**: Without additional context on why `successNotificationsDelayProperty` was removed or if there's an alternative implementation, the safest resolution is to preserve the property if it's deemed necessary for the functionality. However, if the removal was intentional (e.g., due to a change in requirements or functionality), then removing it might be the correct choice.

Given the information, I'll proceed with a cautious approach. The code snippet provided is in markdown code syntax, and we need to return it as is, with the conflict resolved if possible.

```java
	public static final Property<String> dialogTextProperty  = new StringProperty("dialogText").hint("Dialog Text").partOfBuiltInSchema();

	public static final Property<String> successNotificationsProperty        = new StringProperty("successNotifications").hint("Notifications after successful execution of action").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successNotificationsPartialProperty = new StringProperty("successNotificationsPartial").hint("CSS selector for partial to display as success notification").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successNotificationsEventProperty   = new StringProperty("successNotificationsEvent").hint("Event to raise for success notifications").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<Integer> successNotificationsDelayProperty  = new IntProperty("successNotificationsDelay").hint("Delay before hiding success notifications").defaultValue(5000).partOfBuiltInSchema();

	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsProperty        = new StringProperty("failureNotifications").hint("Notifications after failed execution of action").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsPartialProperty = new StringProperty("failureNotificationsPartial").hint("CSS selector for partial to display as failure notification").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsEventProperty   = new StringProperty("failureNotificationsEvent").hint("Event to raise for failure notifications").partOfBuiltInSchema();
