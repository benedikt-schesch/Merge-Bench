To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes brought in by both sides of the merge.

The given Java code snippet appears to be part of a class, possibly used for handling or processing certain types of data or files, given the presence of variables like `code`, `options`, `mhtmlRoot`, `outputFilename`, `maxUriLength`, and `maxImageSize`. The variable `maxUriLength` is initialized with a default value `DEFAULT_MAX_URI_LENGTH`, indicating a specific limit, in this case, related to IE8's data URI length limit.

The conflict arises around the declaration of `maxImageSize`. The local version (`HEAD`) includes a declaration for `maxImageSize` without an explicit initialization value, implying it might be initialized elsewhere or have a default value set elsewhere in the code. The other version (`790b69a0bd40e3ab536f9c6568748f981b3d525e`) does not include this declaration at all.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both versions:

1. **The intent of `HEAD`**: By including `maxImageSize`, this version suggests that `maxImageSize` is a necessary or useful field for the class's functionality. Its presence implies that the class might be handling images and needs to track or limit their size.

2. **The intent of `790b69a0bd40e3ab536f9c6568748f981b3d525e`**: The absence of `maxImageSize` in this version could mean that either it's not necessary for the functionality implemented by this branch, or its functionality is handled differently (e.g., through a different variable or method).

Without additional context about how `maxImageSize` is used or why it's not present in one of the versions, the safest resolution is to preserve the variable declaration if it doesn't introduce any conflicts or errors with the rest of the code in the merged version.

However, since `maxImageSize` is declared but not initialized in the `HEAD` version, and without knowing its intended use or default value, we must be cautious.

Given the information and sticking strictly to the task:

```java
    private String code = null;
    private int options = 1;
    private String mhtmlRoot = "";
    private String outputFilename = "";
    private int maxUriLength = DEFAULT_MAX_URI_LENGTH;  //IE8 only allows dataURIs up to 32KB
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private int maxImageSize;
