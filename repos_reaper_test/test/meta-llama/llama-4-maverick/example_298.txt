To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the intent of both sides of the merge.

The given Java method `unmarshall` is used to convert a `DBObject` into an object of a specified class `T`. The method uses a `DocumentStreamFactory` to create a `DocumentStream` from the `DBObject`, suggesting that the `DBObject` is being treated as a document ( possibly JSON or a similar format) that needs to be deserialized.

On the `HEAD` side, the code attempts to read the value from the `DocumentStream` using a `mapper`. It passes the data, offset, and size of the stream to the `readValue` method along with the target class `clazz`. This suggests that the `mapper` is likely an instance of a class that can deserialize data from a stream or byte array into a Java object.

On the other side of the merge (`4dad4b6f9ffd42aaf0a81bf4fc4026ac51e656d0`), the code uses a `reader` to read the value from a variable named `json`, with the type specified by `clazz`. The fact that it uses `reader.withType(clazz).readValue(json)` implies that `json` is the content that needs to be deserialized, and `reader` is capable of deserializing it into the desired type.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a couple of issues:
1. The variable `json` is not defined anywhere in the provided snippet on the `4dad4b6f9ffd42aaf0a81bf4fc4026ac51e656d0` side.
2. The `HEAD` side uses `stream.getData()`, `stream.getOffset()`, and `stream.getSize()` to read from the `DocumentStream`, while the other side seems to directly use a `json` variable.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions. The `HEAD` version is directly working with the `DocumentStream` derived from the `DBObject`, while the other version seems to be working with a `json` content that is supposed to be deserialized.

Since `json` is not defined in the provided snippet for the `4dad4b6f9ffd42aaf0a81bf4fc4026ac51e656d0` side, and assuming it should be derived from the `document` or `stream`, we can't directly merge without knowing how `json` is generated. 

However, if we consider that `json` might be derived from the `document` or `stream` and is intended to be deserialized into the target class, we still need a clear definition or derivation of `json` to make an informed decision.

Let's examine a possible resolution by assuming that both sides are trying to achieve deserialization of the `DBObject` into the target class, but through slightly different means.

```java
public <T> T unmarshall(DBObject document, Class<T> clazz) throws MarshallingException {

    DocumentStream stream = DocumentStreamFactory.fromDBObject(document);
    try {
        // Assuming 'mapper' is similar to 'reader' in functionality and 'stream' can be used to get 'json' or directly deserialize
        // For the sake of resolution, let's consider using 'mapper' or a similar deserialization mechanism directly on 'stream'
        return mapper.readValue(stream.getData(), stream.getOffset(), stream.getSize(), clazz);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        String message = String.format("Unable to unmarshall result to %s from content %s", clazz, document.toString());
        throw new MarshallingException(message, e);
    }
}

public DBObject marshall(Object obj) throws MarshallingException {
```

Or, if we were to use the `reader` and assuming `json` is derived from `document` or `stream`:

```java
public <T> T unmarshall(DBObject document, Class<T> clazz) throws MarshallingException {

    DocumentStream stream = DocumentStreamFactory.fromDBObject(document);
    String json = new String(stream.getData(), stream.getOffset(), stream.getSize());
    try {
        return reader.withType(clazz).readValue(json);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        String message = String.format("Unable to unmarshall from json: %s to %s", json, clazz);
        throw new MarshallingException(message, e);
    }
}

public DBObject marshall(Object obj) throws MarshallingException {
```

Given the information and the need to preserve the original context and spacing, the original snippet with conflict is:
```java

    public <T> T unmarshall(DBObject document, Class<T> clazz) throws MarshallingException {

        DocumentStream stream = DocumentStreamFactory.fromDBObject(document);
        try {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            return mapper.readValue(stream.getData(), stream.getOffset(), stream.getSize(), clazz);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            String message = String.format("Unable to unmarshall result to %s from content %s", clazz, document.toString());
=======
            return reader.withType(clazz).readValue(json);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            String message = String.format("Unable to unmarshall from json: %s to %s", json, clazz);
>>>>>>> 4dad4b6f9ffd42aaf0a81bf4fc4026ac51e656d0
            throw new MarshallingException(message, e);
        }
    }

    public DBObject marshall(Object obj) throws MarshallingException {
