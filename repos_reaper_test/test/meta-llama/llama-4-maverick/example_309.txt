To resolve the merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet and the context surrounding it.

The provided Java code snippet appears to be part of a class that handles the consumption of a stream and provides methods to convert its content into different formats, such as a string or a `JSONObject`. The snippet includes a merge conflict.

```java
            if (reader != null) {
                reader.close();
                setStreamConsumed(true);
            }
        }
<<<<<<< HEAD
        return str;
=======
>>>>>>> b807edeecf20796a588b8510ceb86d80f0cad699
    }

    public JSONObject asJSONObject() throws ResponseException {
        try {
            return new JSONObject(asString());
```

The conflict is between the lines `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> b807edeecf20796a588b8510ceb86d80f0cad699`. The code on the left side of the conflict (`HEAD`) contains `return str;`, which suggests that there's a method (likely `asString()`) that returns a string representation of the stream content. The presence of `return str;` implies that this line is part of the `asString()` method, which is returning the string `str`.

The code on the right side of the conflict is empty, suggesting that the other branch (b807edeecf20796a588b8510ceb86d80f0cad699) might have removed or never had this `return str;` statement, or it's not relevant in that branch.

To resolve this, we need to understand the intent behind both versions:

1. The `HEAD` version is returning `str`, which is presumably the content read from the stream. This is likely the correct behavior for the `asString()` method, as it should return the content as a string.

2. The other version (b807edeecf20796a588b8510ceb86d80f0cad699) does not have this `return str;` statement. This could imply that either the return statement was removed or it was never there in the first place.

Given that the method is named `asString()` and it's reasonable to expect it to return a string, and considering the presence of `return str;` in the `HEAD` version, it seems likely that the intent is to return the string representation of the content.

However, directly above the conflict, there's a closing bracket `}`, which suggests that the `return str;` statement is indeed within the `asString()` method. If the other branch removed this return or never had it, it could lead to a compilation error if the method is declared to return a value.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent of both sides, we should check if the removal of `return str;` in the other branch was intentional and if it affects the method's functionality.

Since `return str;` is necessary for the `asString()` method to return the expected string value, and assuming `str` is defined and used correctly within this method (not shown in the snippet), the most logical resolution, based on the information given and focusing on the method's intent, is to keep `return str;`.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
            if (reader != null) {
                reader.close();
                setStreamConsumed(true);
            }
        }
        return str;
    }

    public JSONObject asJSONObject() throws ResponseException {
        try {
            return new JSONObject(asString());
```
