To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of an Android application, given the presence of Android-specific classes like `BroadcastReceiver` and `SharedPreferences`. The variables declared are related to managing a background timer, image URL, adapters for displaying data, and presenters for cards in a UI, likely for a media or TV show application.

The conflict arises from the declaration of a `SharedPreferences` object named `mSharedPreferences`. On one side of the merge (represented by `HEAD`), this variable is declared. On the other side (represented by the commit hash `308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5`), this line is absent, suggesting it was either never added or was removed.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind the inclusion or exclusion of `mSharedPreferences`.

1. **Understanding `HEAD` Side**: The presence of `mSharedPreferences` on the `HEAD` side suggests that this variable is used somewhere in the code for storing or retrieving application preferences. It implies that the code might be accessing or modifying shared preferences for certain functionalities.

2. **Understanding the Other Side**: The absence of `mSharedPreferences` on the other side could mean that either the code didn't require accessing shared preferences at that point, or the usage of `mSharedPreferences` was removed or not yet introduced.

Given the information available in the snippet, we can't directly infer how `mSharedPreferences` is used or if its absence on one side is due to a removal or it being a part of a different feature. However, we can look at the surrounding code for clues.

Since `mSharedPreferences` is not used within the provided snippet, we have to make an educated guess based on the context. 

If we consider the semantic intent:
- If the feature related to `mSharedPreferences` is crucial and used elsewhere in the class (not shown in the snippet), removing it could break functionality. 
- If the feature is not essential or is handled differently on the other side of the merge, its absence might be acceptable.

Without more context on how `mSharedPreferences` is used or the specific changes made on both sides, the safest resolution would be to preserve the conflict as is or to choose one side based on additional context not provided here.

However, since the task requires returning the entire snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context, and given that we are not provided with enough information to confidently resolve the conflict, the output will remain as is.
