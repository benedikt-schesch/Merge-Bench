To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided is a part of a Java class that seems to be using the AndEngine library for game development on Android. The snippet includes various import statements necessary for the class.

The conflict arises from the addition of a new import statement:
```java
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.region.TextureRegionFactory;
```
on the `e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885` side of the merge, which is not present on the `HEAD` side.

To understand the intent behind this addition, we need to consider what `TextureRegionFactory` is used for. `TextureRegionFactory` is a utility class in AndEngine that helps in creating `ITextureRegion` instances from `ITexture` objects. Its inclusion suggests that somewhere in the code (not shown in this snippet), there's a need to create texture regions, possibly for sprite rendering or other graphical elements.

Since the addition of `TextureRegionFactory` does not conflict with any existing import or functionality directly (as there's no other code shown that it directly interacts with or conflicts with), and assuming that the code on the `e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885` side is using this import for a valid purpose, the most straightforward resolution is to include this import.

Therefore, the resolved code snippet, preserving the original context and spacing, should be:

```java
import org.andengine.entity.sprite.Sprite;
import org.andengine.entity.util.FPSLogger;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.ITexture;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.bitmap.BitmapTexture;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.region.ITextureRegion;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.region.TextureRegionFactory;
import org.andengine.ui.activity.SimpleBaseGameActivity;
import org.andengine.util.debug.Debug;

import android.widget.Toast;
```

In markdown code syntax as requested, the resolution is:
```java
import org.andengine.entity.sprite.Sprite;
import org.andengine.entity.util.FPSLogger;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.ITexture;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.bitmap.BitmapTexture;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.region.ITextureRegion;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.region.TextureRegionFactory;
import org.andengine.ui.activity.SimpleBaseGameActivity;
import org.andengine.util.debug.Debug;

import android.widget.Toast;
```
