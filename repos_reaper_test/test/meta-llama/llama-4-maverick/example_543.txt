To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first examine the code snippet provided and understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

```java
        try {
            for (String c : jaxRsResources) {
                resources.add(Class.forName(c));
            }
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "Cannot locate the JAXRS resource class.",
                    e);
=======
            LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE,
                    "Cannot locate the JAXRS resource class.", e);
>>>>>>> 1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f
            System.exit(1);
        }
        Reference baseRef = endpoint != null ? new Reference(endpoint) : null;
        return JaxRsIntrospector.getDefinition(jaxrsApplication,
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

The conflict arises in two areas:

1. The logging statement within the catch block.
2. The line after the `return JaxRsIntrospector.getDefinition(jaxrsApplication,`.

Let's analyze the first conflict:

- On the left side (`HEAD`), the logging statement is split into two lines: `LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "Cannot locate the JAXRS resource class.",` and `e);`. 
- On the right side (`1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f`), the logging statement is also split but with a different line break: `LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE,` and `"Cannot locate the JAXRS resource class.", e);`.

Both versions are attempting to log a severe error when a JAXRS resource class cannot be located, including the exception (`e`). The difference is merely in formatting (line breaks). 

To resolve this conflict semantically, we should consider the intent, which is to log the error. Since both sides log the same message and exception, just with different formatting, we can choose one format. Let's keep the version from `HEAD` as it is, because it is a common Java formatting style for method calls with multiple parameters.

The second conflict is incomplete as the code after `return JaxRsIntrospector.getDefinition(jaxrsApplication,` is not provided on either side, so we cannot determine the intent or resolve it.

Given the information and focusing on the first conflict, the resolution for the logging statement could be to keep the `HEAD` version. However, since the second conflict is incomplete and we are instructed not to modify the context or remove any part of the snippet, we will return the original snippet with the conflicts as is.

```java
        try {
            for (String c : jaxRsResources) {
                resources.add(Class.forName(c));
            }
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "Cannot locate the JAXRS resource class.",
                    e);
=======
            LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE,
                    "Cannot locate the JAXRS resource class.", e);
>>>>>>> 1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f
            System.exit(1);
        }
        Reference baseRef = endpoint != null ? new Reference(endpoint) : null;
        return JaxRsIntrospector.getDefinition(jaxrsApplication,
<<<<<<< HEAD
