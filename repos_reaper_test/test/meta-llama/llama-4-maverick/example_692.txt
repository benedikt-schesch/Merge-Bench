To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made in both branches.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that defines various properties for handling notifications and behaviors after the execution of certain actions. These properties are related to failure notifications and success behaviors, including what notifications to display, how to display them, and what actions to take upon success or failure.

The conflict arises from the lines related to `failureNotificationsDelayProperty`. The `HEAD` version (the local branch being merged into) includes a definition for `failureNotificationsDelayProperty`, which is an `IntProperty` that specifies a delay before hiding failure notifications, with a default value of 5000 (presumably milliseconds, i.e., 5 seconds).

The other branch (`d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5`) does not have this property defined. This suggests that the property was either removed or never existed in this branch.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both versions:

1. The `HEAD` version includes `failureNotificationsDelayProperty`, suggesting that the delay before hiding failure notifications is a required or useful feature in this branch.
2. The other branch does not include `failureNotificationsDelayProperty`, which could mean that either it's not necessary, or its functionality is handled differently (e.g., through a different property or mechanism).

Without additional context about why `failureNotificationsDelayProperty` was included in one branch but not the other, the most straightforward resolution is to decide whether the delay property is necessary based on the application's requirements.

However, since the task is to resolve the conflict based on the provided snippet without modifying the context or making assumptions beyond what's given, and to return the entire snippet in markdown code syntax as provided, the resolution should focus on preserving the original intent and code structure.

Given the information and the task constraints, the conflict resolution involves deciding whether to keep or remove `failureNotificationsDelayProperty`. Since there's no clear indication that one version is definitively correct over the other, and without further context on the application's requirements or the reasoning behind the changes in both branches, the conflict should be resolved by considering the semantic intent.

If we consider that both branches have made valid changes and there's no indication that `failureNotificationsDelayProperty` is redundant or incorrect, we might lean towards keeping it, assuming it's a valid feature. However, the task doesn't explicitly allow for analysis beyond the given snippet.

Therefore, the resolution, in this case, is to return the snippet as is, with the conflict markers, since we are instructed not to modify the context and to preserve the spacing as is, and there's no clear resolution based on the provided information.
