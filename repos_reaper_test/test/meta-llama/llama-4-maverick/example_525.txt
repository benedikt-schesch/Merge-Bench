To resolve the merge conflict, let's first analyze the given code snippet and understand the intent behind both sides of the merge.

The provided Java code snippet appears to be part of a larger method or class that handles URLs and data URIs, potentially in the context of optimizing or processing web resources. The code checks the length of a URI string against a specified maximum length (`maxUriLength`) and performs different actions based on this comparison.

Here's the snippet with the conflict:
```java
if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength) {
    if (verbose){
        System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
    }      
<<<<<<< HEAD
    builder.append(url);
} else if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength){
    if (verbose) {
        System.err.println("[INFO] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI longer than " + maxUriLength + " characters. Skipping.");
    }

    builder.append(url);
} else {

    /*
     * Determine what to do. Eventually, you should be able to
```

Upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that both `if` conditions in the conflict are checking the same condition (`maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength`), but they are printing different warning messages to the console based on whether the verbose flag is set. The messages differ in their description of the URI length (bytes vs. characters) and the log level (WARNING vs. INFO).

The left side of the merge conflict (HEAD) contains both conditions, which are essentially the same, indicating a potential error or redundancy. The right side of the conflict (`790b69a0bd40e3ab536f9c6568748f981b3d525e`) removes the second condition, suggesting that it is unnecessary or incorrect.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we must understand that having two identical conditions is redundant and potentially a mistake. The correct resolution should remove the duplicate or unnecessary code while preserving the intended functionality.

Given this, the correct resolution involves removing the redundant `else if` condition. The first condition already checks if `uriString.length() > maxUriLength` and prints a warning message indicating that the data URI is larger than `maxUriLength` bytes. The second condition is unnecessary because it checks the same condition.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
                        
                        if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength) {
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                            }      
                            builder.append(url);
                        } else {

                            /*
                             * Determine what to do. Eventually, you should be able to
