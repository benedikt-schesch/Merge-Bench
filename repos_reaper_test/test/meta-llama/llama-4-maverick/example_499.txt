To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the code snippet and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles loading and managing resources (like textures and scenes) in a game or graphical application, likely using the AndEngine library.

The conflict arises in the following section:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTexture);
=======
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
```

Here, the two versions of the code differ in the argument passed to `loadTexture()`. The version from `HEAD` (the local branch) passes `this.mBitmapTexture`, while the version from the other branch (`91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d`) passes `this.mBitmapTextureAtlas`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. 

1. `this.mBitmapTexture` suggests a single texture is being loaded.
2. `this.mBitmapTextureAtlas` suggests a texture atlas (a large texture that contains multiple smaller textures) is being loaded.

Without additional context about what `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas` represent or how they are used elsewhere in the code, we have to make an educated guess based on their names and the method they are passed to.

- If `mBitmapTextureAtlas` is a more comprehensive or updated version that includes the functionality or content of `mBitmapTexture`, and is intended to be used in the same context, then loading `mBitmapTextureAtlas` might be the correct choice.
- However, if both `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas` serve different purposes or are used in different contexts, we need to understand if they are mutually exclusive or if both are needed.

Given the names and assuming `mBitmapTextureAtlas` is a texture atlas that likely includes multiple textures (potentially including what `mBitmapTexture` represents), and considering the method is named `loadTexture` (not `loadTextureAtlas`), there might be a discrepancy or a need for clarification on whether the engine's `loadTexture` method can handle a texture atlas.

Since the intent is not entirely clear without more context (e.g., how `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas` are defined, initialized, and used elsewhere), a safe resolution isn't straightforward.

However, let's examine the possibility that both changes are aiming to achieve a similar goal - loading a necessary texture or texture atlas for the application.

```java
			this.mMusic.setLooping(true);
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```

Or 
```java
			this.mMusic.setLooping(true);
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTexture);
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```

Both of these resolutions assume that one of the variables is the correct one to use. However, if both are necessary for different reasons, the conflict resolution would involve ensuring both are loaded appropriately, potentially like so:

```java
			this.mMusic.setLooping(true);
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTexture);
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```

But this introduces a new change not directly represented by either side of the merge.

Given the information and sticking strictly to the task:

```java
			this.mMusic.setLooping(true);
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}

<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTexture);
=======
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```
