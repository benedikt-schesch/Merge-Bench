To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that manages comments and voting functionality, possibly within a social media or forum application. The class has several member variables related to UI state and progress dialogs.

The conflict arises from the introduction of a new member variable `private URLSpan[] mVoteTargetSpans = null;` on one side of the merge (between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> c08e0d7adee3a6c42dfe2887fad422ea332c015e` markers).

Here's the step-by-step thought process:

1. **Understand the Context**: The surrounding code is related to managing UI state, specifically for voting on comments. It includes variables for tracking the target view for voting, information about the comment being voted on, and progress dialogs for loading comments.

2. **Analyze the Conflict**: The conflict is about whether to include `private URLSpan[] mVoteTargetSpans = null;`. This line introduces a new variable that seems related to the voting functionality, possibly for handling or storing URL spans within the vote target comment.

3. **Consider the Intent**: The introduction of `mVoteTargetSpans` suggests that one side of the merge is implementing or modifying functionality related to handling URLs within comments being voted on. This could be for various purposes, such as clickable links within comments or tracking engagement with specific links.

4. **Resolve the Conflict**: To resolve the conflict, we should consider whether the introduction of `mVoteTargetSpans` aligns with the overall functionality and intent of the class. If the class is designed to handle voting and comment management, and `mVoteTargetSpans` serves a related purpose (e.g., handling links within comments), then including it might be appropriate.

5. **Decision**: Given that there's no clear indication that `mVoteTargetSpans` conflicts with the existing functionality or that it's redundant, and assuming its purpose aligns with the class's responsibilities, the conflict can be resolved by accepting the change.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
    private int mNumVisibleComments;

    // UI State
    private View mVoteTargetView = null;
    private CommentInfo mVoteTargetCommentInfo = null;
    private URLSpan[] mVoteTargetSpans = null;
    
    // ProgressDialogs with percentage bars
    private AutoResetProgressDialog mLoadingCommentsProgress;
    
    /**
```
