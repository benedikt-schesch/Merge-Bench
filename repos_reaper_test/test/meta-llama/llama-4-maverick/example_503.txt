To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made in both branches.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class used for handling graphics or game development, given the presence of `Camera`, `BuildableBitmapTexture`, `BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas`, and `BaseTextureRegion` variables.

The conflict arises from the declaration of a variable: 
- One branch (HEAD) declares a `private BuildableBitmapTexture mBuildableTexture;`
- The other branch (91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d) declares a `private BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas mBuildableBitmapTextureAtlas;`

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes.

1. **`BuildableBitmapTexture` vs `BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas`**: The key difference here is between a texture and a texture atlas. A texture represents a single image, while a texture atlas is a larger image that contains multiple smaller images (sub-textures or sprites). Using a texture atlas can be more efficient for rendering multiple sprites in a single draw call, which is a common optimization technique in graphics and game development.

2. **Analyzing the Intent**:
   - The presence of `BaseTextureRegion[] mSVGTestTextureRegions;` suggests that the class is dealing with multiple texture regions, which could be related to either a texture atlas or individual textures.
   - The change from `BuildableBitmapTexture` to `BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas` implies a shift towards potentially using a texture atlas, which could be more efficient or suitable for the application's requirements.

3. **Resolving the Conflict**:
   - If both changes are necessary and serve different purposes, there might be a need to reconcile them in a way that accommodates both intents. However, based on the given context, it seems that they are alternatives rather than complementary changes.
   - Without additional context on why both branches made these different changes, the most straightforward resolution would be to choose one based on the project's current requirements or to refactor the code in a way that potentially includes both, if that's the intent.

Given the information and the code snippet:

```java
	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;
<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BuildableBitmapTexture mBuildableTexture;
=======
	private BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas mBuildableBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private BaseTextureRegion[] mSVGTestTextureRegions;

	// ===========================================================
	// Constructors
	// ===========================================================
```

Let's analyze further:

- If the project requires handling multiple textures efficiently, `BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas` might be more appropriate.
- If the requirement is for a single texture or not necessarily an atlas, `BuildableBitmapTexture` could be what's needed.

Since there's not enough information to definitively say which one is correct or if there's a better way to reconcile them (like using both for different purposes), and to avoid making assumptions, the conflict should be returned as is.

```java
	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;
<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BuildableBitmapTexture mBuildableTexture;

	private BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas mBuildableBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private BaseTextureRegion[] mSVGTestTextureRegions;
