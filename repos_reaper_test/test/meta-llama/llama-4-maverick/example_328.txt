To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of an Android application, specifically a fragment or activity that displays a list of users (followers). The conflict arises in the `setupState()` method, where the type of `mUserList` is being cast to either `PullToRefreshListView` or `ListView` when it's initialized using `findViewById(R.id.follower_list)`.

### Analysis of the Conflict

- The left-hand side (HEAD) of the conflict uses `PullToRefreshListView`, which suggests that the list is intended to have a "pull-to-refresh" functionality. This is a common feature in mobile apps where the user can refresh the content by pulling down on the list.
  
- The right-hand side (5f1eecd58485bc3b7c0bc8e0b479d0b2d40f344b) uses `ListView`, a basic Android widget for displaying a list of items. This change could indicate either a simplification or a refactoring where the "pull-to-refresh" functionality is not needed or is handled differently.

### Resolving the Conflict

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes:

1. **If the "pull-to-refresh" functionality is intended and used elsewhere in the code or is part of the application's requirement**, then `mUserList` should be a `PullToRefreshListView`. This implies that the left-hand side change is the correct one.

2. **If the application does not require "pull-to-refresh" or if this functionality is achieved through other means (e.g., using a SwipeRefreshLayout around a ListView or RecyclerView)**, then casting to `ListView` might be appropriate or a step towards using a more modern approach (like RecyclerView).

Given the information and without additional context on whether `PullToRefreshListView` is a custom or third-party component and its status regarding maintenance or compatibility, we can consider the following:

- If `PullToRefreshListView` is a custom or library component that is still supported and used consistently in the app, the left-hand side change is likely correct.
- If `PullToRefreshListView` is deprecated or not used consistently, the right-hand side might be part of a refactoring effort.

### Decision

Without knowing the specific requirements or the broader context (such as whether `PullToRefreshListView` is used elsewhere and is part of the app's intended functionality), it's challenging to make a definitive decision. However, the presence of "PullToRefreshListView" suggests a specific functionality that might be intended.

If we assume that `PullToRefreshListView` is a valid and intended component for this part of the application, we would lean towards resolving the conflict by choosing the left-hand side. However, the exact resolution depends on the project's specific context and requirements.

### Returning the Snippet

Since the problem requires returning the entire snippet with the conflict resolved or unchanged if the intent is ambiguous, and given that we are not provided with enough information to definitively resolve the intent behind the merge conflict, the snippet will be returned as is.

```java

	@Override
	protected void setupState() {
		setTitle(getActivityTitle());

<<<<<<< HEAD
		mUserList = (PullToRefreshListView) findViewById(R.id.follower_list);
=======
		mUserList = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.follower_list);
>>>>>>> 5f1eecd58485bc3b7c0bc8e0b479d0b2d40f344b

		setupListHeader(true);

		mUserListAdapter = new UserArrayAdapter(this);
		mUserList.setAdapter(mUserListAdapter);

```
