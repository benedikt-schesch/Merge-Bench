To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and intent behind both versions of the code.

The given code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class, likely using JUnit for testing. The context revolves around testing the behavior of an event processor (`processor`) in response to certain events, specifically resource change events.

1. **Understanding the Conflict**:
   - The conflict is in a test method annotated with `@Test`, indicating it's a test case.
   - The left-hand side (`<<<<<<< HEAD`) of the conflict suggests a test method named `shouldRespondToPostChangeEvents`, implying the test is checking if the processor responds to post-change events.
   - The right-hand side (`>>>>>>> ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586`) suggests a different test method name, `shouldNotRespondToPostChangeEvents`, with a comment explaining the rationale behind not responding to change events but rather to post-build events.

2. **Analyzing the Intent**:
   - The original code (`shouldRespondToPostChangeEvents`) seems to be testing if the processor can handle or respond to post-change events.
   - The incoming change (`shouldNotRespondToPostChangeEvents`) renames the test and adds a comment suggesting that responding to post-change events might not be desirable; instead, responding after the build is finished (post-build event) is considered better.

3. **Resolving the Conflict**:
   - Both versions create a `ResourceChangeEvent` with the type `POST_CHANGE` and then assert that the processor cannot process this event (`assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event))`).
   - The core logic of the test (creating an event and verifying the processor's behavior) remains the same on both sides; the primary difference is the test method's name and the explanatory comment.

Given that the actual test logic (`assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event))` and `verifyNoInteractions(workspace)`) is identical on both sides of the merge and that the difference lies in the method name and an added comment, we can infer that the intent is to test that the processor does not respond to post-change events.

The new name `shouldNotRespondToPostChangeEvents` and the accompanying comment better explain the rationale behind the test. Thus, it seems reasonable to adopt this version, as it provides clearer intent.

Here's the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java

		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

	@Test
	public void shouldNotRespondToPostChangeEvents() {
		// Not sure why we wanted to respond to change events, seems better to respond to the post build event, once the build is finished
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, POST_CHANGE, AUTO_BUILD, null);
		assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event));

		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

```
