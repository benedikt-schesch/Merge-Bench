To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class for the Chronicle Map project, given the package declaration `net.openhft.chronicle.map`. The imports bring in various classes from different libraries, including Guava (`com.google.common.base.Preconditions`), Chronicle Core (`net.openhft.chronicle.core`), and JUnit (`org.junit`).

The merge conflict arises from the addition of different import statements in the conflicting commits. The `HEAD` (the current branch being merged into) does not include the import for `net.openhft.chronicle.core.Jvm`, whereas the commit `67b612c2568b82917bb090cac5046a34462e9d24` (being merged into `HEAD`) does.

To resolve this, we need to understand the intent behind both changes:
1. The `HEAD` contains imports necessary for its existing functionality, including `Preconditions` from Guava, `OS` from Chronicle Core, and JUnit related classes.
2. The other side (`67b612c2568b82917bb090cac5046a34462e9d24`) introduces an import for `Jvm` from Chronicle Core, suggesting that this commit might be using `Jvm` somewhere in the code (though the usage is not shown in the provided snippet).

Given that there's no indication of the `Jvm` import being used within the snippet provided, and without the actual code changes or context where `Jvm` is utilized, we can still infer that both changes are import statements, which are generally additive and not conflicting in nature unless they introduce ambiguity (e.g., duplicate class names).

Therefore, the resolution involves including both import statements, as they serve different purposes and are likely used in different parts of the class.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:
