To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The given Java code snippet is handling an exception and then processing annotations on a field. The conflict arises around the lines related to the `BeanParam` annotation.

```java
        } catch (UnsupportedTypeException e) {
            LOGGER.warning("Could not add field " + field + ". "
                    + e.getMessage());
            return;
        } // Introduced by Jax-rs 2.0
<<<<<<< HEAD
          // BeanParam beanparam = field.getAnnotation(BeanParam.class);
=======
        // BeanParam beanparam = field.getAnnotation(BeanParam.class);
>>>>>>> 1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f

        DefaultValue defaultvalue = field.getAnnotation(DefaultValue.class);
        String defaultValueString = defaultvalue != null ? defaultvalue.value()
                : null;
```

Looking at the conflict, both sides of the merge are commenting out the line that retrieves the `BeanParam` annotation from the field. The difference lies in the indentation and the fact that both versions are essentially doing the same thing - commenting out the `BeanParam` related line.

The intent here seems to be disabling or removing the processing of `BeanParam` annotation temporarily or permanently, as indicated by the comment. Since both versions are commenting out the line, the semantic intent is the same.

To resolve the conflict, we can simply choose one version of the commented-out line. The difference in indentation between the two versions (`HEAD` has an extra space) is not significant in terms of Java syntax, but consistency is good practice.

Let's preserve the original spacing as is and directly return the code snippet as it does not modify the context. However, to resolve the conflict, we will remove the conflict markers and align with the original formatting as closely as possible.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
        } catch (UnsupportedTypeException e) {
            LOGGER.warning("Could not add field " + field + ". "
                    + e.getMessage());
            return;
        } // Introduced by Jax-rs 2.0
        // BeanParam beanparam = field.getAnnotation(BeanParam.class);

        DefaultValue defaultvalue = field.getAnnotation(DefaultValue.class);
        String defaultValueString = defaultvalue != null ? defaultvalue.value()
                : null;
```
