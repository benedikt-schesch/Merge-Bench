To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a data mapping or deserialization process, possibly within a larger framework or application that handles JSON data. The specific section deals with converting a raw value (presumably from a JSON object) to an enum type. If the conversion fails, it catches an `IllegalArgumentException` and logs a debug message if the logger is enabled for debug level.

The conflict arises in the logging statement within the catch block. The two versions of the code differ in what they log as the string value that failed to be mapped to an enum.

1. The version from `HEAD` (local changes) logs the `rawValue.asString()` as the string that cannot be mapped to the enum.
2. The version from `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` (incoming changes) logs `jsonObject.getString(facebookFieldName)` as the string that cannot be mapped.

Let's analyze the intent behind both changes:

- The `HEAD` version is directly using `rawValue.asString()`, which is consistent with how `Enum.valueOf` is called. It implies that `rawValue` is the source of the value being attempted to convert to an enum.

- The incoming change (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) uses `jsonObject.getString(facebookFieldName)`, suggesting that the actual string value being retrieved from a JSON object using a specific field name (`facebookFieldName`). This could imply that the logging is trying to provide more context or the actual value as retrieved from the JSON source.

Both intents seem valid, but they serve slightly different purposes. The `HEAD` version is consistent with the value being used for the enum conversion, while the incoming change provides a potentially more accurate representation of the source data (from the JSON object).

However, `rawValue.asString()` and `jsonObject.getString(facebookFieldName)` are supposed to represent the same value if the code is correctly functioning. If they are not the same, it could indicate an issue elsewhere in the code.

To resolve the conflict, we need to decide which logging statement better serves the purpose of debugging. Given that `rawValue.asString()` is used in `Enum.valueOf(enumType, rawValue.asString())`, it seems logical to log this value for consistency. However, if `jsonObject.getString(facebookFieldName)` provides more context or is considered more representative of the source data, it might be preferable.

Since the intent is somewhat ambiguous without more context (e.g., whether `rawValue` is directly derived from `jsonObject` using `facebookFieldName`), a conservative approach would be to preserve both pieces of information if possible. However, given the constraint of the logging statement, we have to choose one.

Let's opt for preserving the incoming change (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) as it might provide more context about the source of the data, assuming that `facebookFieldName` is relevant for debugging purposes.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
      Class<? extends Enum> enumType = type.asSubclass(Enum.class);
      try {
        return Enum.valueOf(enumType, rawValue.asString());
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException iae) {
        if (MAPPER_LOGGER.isDebugEnabled()) {
          MAPPER_LOGGER.debug(
            format("Cannot map string %s to enum %s", jsonObject.getString(facebookFieldName), enumType.getName()));
        }
      }
    }

    String rawValueAsString = jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue);
```
