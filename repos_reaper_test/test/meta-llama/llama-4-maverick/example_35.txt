To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that implements certain methods related to server information, specifically `getVersion()` and `getStartupTime()`. The conflict arises in the `getVersion()` method.

The `getVersion()` method attempts to retrieve the version of the `ServerInfo` class's package implementation. If an exception occurs during this process, it is caught, and the method returns a default version string if the retrieved version is null.

The conflict is between two different default version strings returned when the version is null or an exception occurs:
- The local version (`HEAD`) returns `"1.4"` as the default.
- The version from the other branch (`c85cbed209c6bf46d7456c18480f2de60b8652b4`) returns `"1.2"` as the default.

Let's analyze the intent:
- Both sides are handling the exception that might occur when trying to get the implementation version.
- The difference lies in the default version returned when the actual version cannot be determined.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the semantic intent behind choosing `"1.4"` versus `"1.2"`. Without additional context about why one version is preferred over the other, the decision could be based on the actual versioning strategy of the project.

However, we can observe that:
- Both sides catch exceptions and return a default version, indicating that the method should not fail if the version cannot be determined.
- The difference in default versions might reflect different assumptions or requirements about the versioning.

Given the information available, if we are to resolve the conflict based on the higher version number (assuming it reflects a more recent or updated state), we would choose `"1.4"`. However, without knowing the project's versioning strategy or the reasoning behind choosing these specific default versions, this is an assumption.

To preserve the original spacing and context, and given that we're not explicitly instructed to resolve the conflict based on a specific logic (like picking the higher version), the original snippet with the conflict is returned as is, in markdown code syntax.

```java
    @Override
    public String getVersion() {
        String version = null;
        try {
            version = ServerInfo.class.getPackage().getImplementationVersion();
<<<<<<< HEAD
        } catch (Exception e) {
        }
        return version != null ? version : "1.4";
=======
        } catch (Exception e) {}
        return version != null ? version : "1.2";
>>>>>>> c85cbed209c6bf46d7456c18480f2de60b8652b4
    }

    @Override
    public String getStartupTime() {
        return startupTime;
```
