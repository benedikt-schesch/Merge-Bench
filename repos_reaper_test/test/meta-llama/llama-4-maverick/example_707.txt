To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles fetching user playlists from some API, indicated by the method `getUserPlaylist` and the call to `doGet`. The conflict is within this method.

On the left side of the conflict (`<<<<<<< HEAD`), there is no code between the method declaration and the `try` block. On the right side (`>>>>>>> 5e4c2091dc2827219ba601937e8686bcb90bae78`), there is an empty line.

Given the context, it seems the change on the right side is either a formatting adjustment or an attempt to add some code later, as indicated by the empty line. However, there's no actual code added.

The method `getUserPlaylist` is designed to fetch user playlists. It encodes the user ID, makes a GET request to fetch the playlist data in JSON format, and then parses this data into `PlaylistRemote` objects using `PlaylistFunctions.getPlaylists`.

Since there's no actual code change on either side of the conflict except for the addition of a blank line on the right side, the conflict is essentially about whether to include this blank line.

To resolve this, we need to consider if the blank line serves any purpose. In Java, blank lines are used for readability and do not affect the functionality of the code. 

Both versions of the code (with or without the blank line) are functionally equivalent. However, to resolve the conflict, we can choose to either include the blank line or not. For the sake of cleanliness and assuming the blank line was not intentionally added for a specific reason (like future code insertion), we could remove it.

However, the task requires returning the entire snippet, including the full context, without modifying the context or spacing unless resolving the conflict. 

Given the conflict is essentially about an empty line, and there's no clear indication that the blank line is necessary or that its removal would be against the intent of the merge, a straightforward resolution would be to remove the conflict markers and the blank line, thus keeping the original code structure.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:
```java
		}
	}

	@Override
	public PlaylistRemote[] getUserPlaylist(String user) throws JSONException, WSError {
		try {
			user = URLEncoder.encode(user, "UTF-8" );
			String jsonString = doGet("id+name+url+duration/playlist/json/playlist_user/?order=starred_desc&user_idstr="+user);
			return PlaylistFunctions.getPlaylists(new JSONArray(jsonString));
		} catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
```
