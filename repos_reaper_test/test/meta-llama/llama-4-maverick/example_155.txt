To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of a test or an example related to Apache Pig, a high-level data processing language and framework. The snippet constructs a Pig script as a string, executes it using a `GruntParser`, and handles exceptions.

The merge conflict arises from the difference in how the `GruntParser` is instantiated. 

On the left side of the conflict (`HEAD`), the `GruntParser` is instantiated with a single argument: `new StringReader(script)`. This suggests that the `GruntParser` is being constructed with a reader that provides the Pig script to be executed.

On the right side of the conflict (`2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea`), the `GruntParser` is instantiated with two arguments: `new StringReader(script)` and `myPig`. The addition of `myPig` as a second argument implies that the `GruntParser` now requires or can utilize an additional object, presumably a `Pig` object or similar, to configure or initialize the parser.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes on both sides. The original code (left side) uses a simpler constructor for `GruntParser`, while the updated code (right side) passes an additional object (`myPig`) to the constructor.

Without additional context about what `myPig` represents or its significance, the most straightforward resolution is to choose one side based on the intent. However, since we're tasked with understanding the semantics and intent:

1. If `myPig` provides necessary configuration or context for the `GruntParser` that is essential for the functionality or correctness of the code (e.g., setting up the Pig environment, configuring the execution context), then the right side's change is meaningful and should be retained.

2. If the original code on the left side is correct and fully functional as is, and there's no compelling reason to introduce `myPig`, then the left side's version could be preferred.

Given the information and adhering strictly to the task:

The conflict resolution involves deciding which instantiation of `GruntParser` is correct or intended. 

Let's preserve the spacing and context as is and return the snippet in markdown code syntax.

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "describe b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";
