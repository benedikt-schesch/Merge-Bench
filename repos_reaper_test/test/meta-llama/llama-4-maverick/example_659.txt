To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class or a component within a larger software system, likely related to Android development given the presence of `AndroidBuildService`. The class has a field `registry` of type `BuildListenerRegistry` injected via the `@Inject` annotation, and another field `buildService` of type `AndroidBuildService`.

The merge conflict arises from the introduction of a new field `projectConfigurationManager` of type `IProjectConfigurationManager` on one side of the merge (the "theirs" side, indicated by `>>>>>>> b782a4bb6b4349d23790909d1e67891adbaa126c`). The other side (the "ours" side, indicated by `<<<<<<< HEAD`) does not have this field.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to consider the intent behind both versions. The "ours" side does not include the `projectConfigurationManager` field, suggesting that either it's not needed or its necessity hasn't been incorporated into this version. The "theirs" side introduces this field, indicating a requirement or enhancement that involves project configuration management.

Since there's no indication that the introduction of `projectConfigurationManager` conflicts with the existing functionality or fields (like `registry` and `buildService`), and assuming it's a valid addition for the functionality intended by "their" changes, we should consider including it.

The `setUp` method is annotated with `@SuppressWarnings("restriction")`, suggesting it's using restricted APIs, possibly from internal packages not intended for public use. However, this is orthogonal to the merge conflict at hand.

Given that there's no apparent conflict in the intent (as the new field doesn't seem to interfere with the existing ones or method), and assuming that the addition of `projectConfigurationManager` serves a necessary purpose (like managing project configurations, which could be related to the `buildService`), the resolution involves including the new field.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:
```java
	@Inject
	private BuildListenerRegistry registry;

	protected AndroidBuildService buildService;

	private IProjectConfigurationManager projectConfigurationManager;

	@Override
	@SuppressWarnings("restriction")
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
	    super.setUp();
```
