To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The provided Java code snippet is part of a file that belongs to the `com.restfb.types` package. The conflict arises from the import statements.

On the left side (`<<<<<<< HEAD`), there are import statements that include `com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromLongFormat` and `java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList`, as well as `com.restfb.Facebook` and `com.restfb.JsonMapper`.

On the right side (`>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`), an additional import statement is introduced: `com.restfb.json.JsonObject.getNames`.

To resolve this conflict, we should analyze the intent behind the changes on both sides. The left side (`HEAD`) seems to be the original or base version of the code with its necessary imports. The right side introduces an additional import statement, suggesting that the code on the right side requires the `getNames` method from `com.restfb.json.JsonObject`.

Given that the additional import on the right side is not conflicting with any imports on the left side (since it's a new import not present on the left), and assuming that this import is necessary for the functionality introduced or modified on the right side, the conflict can be resolved by including all the import statements.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:
