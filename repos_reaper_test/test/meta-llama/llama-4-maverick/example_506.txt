To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The given code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles loading resources and scenes for a game or graphical application using the AndEngine framework. 

The context provided includes:
1. A try-catch block where it attempts to create a sound from an asset named "explosion.ogg" and assigns it to `this.mExplosionSound`. If an `IOException` occurs, it logs the error.
2. A merge conflict where the local version (`HEAD`) has no additional code, but the incoming version (`91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d`) includes a line to load a texture (`this.mBitmapTextureAtlas`) using the engine's texture manager.
3. A method override for `onLoadScene()` where it registers an `FPSLogger` as an update handler with the engine.

The intent behind the local changes (`HEAD`) seems to be focused on ensuring that the sound loading code is properly handled without adding any new functionality related to texture loading in the given context.

The incoming changes (`91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d`) aim to load a texture (`this.mBitmapTextureAtlas`) into the engine's texture manager. This suggests that the texture is necessary for the application, possibly for rendering the explosion or other graphical elements.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider whether loading `this.mBitmapTextureAtlas` is necessary and if it conflicts with the intent of the local changes. Since the local changes do not introduce any new functionality related to texture loading, and there's no indication that loading the texture would interfere with the sound loading or the `onLoadScene()` method, we can infer that loading the texture is a complementary change.

Therefore, the resolution involves including the texture loading line in the code. Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
		try {
			this.mExplosionSound = SoundFactory.createSoundFromAsset(this.mEngine.getSoundManager(), this, "explosion.ogg");
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```
