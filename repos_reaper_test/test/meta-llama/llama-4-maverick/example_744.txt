To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the code snippet and understand the intent behind both versions of the conflicting code.

The conflict is within a `for` loop that iterates over a collection of widgets (`mOpenWidgets`). The loop adjusts the vertical position (`setYSmooth`) of each widget based on a cumulative height (`mTotalHeight`) and then increments `mTotalHeight` by the height of the current widget plus some spacing (`mSpacing`).

The conflicting lines are related to the condition `if (widget != ignore)`. The version from `HEAD` (the local changes) simply calls `widget.setYSmooth(mTotalHeight);` if the condition is true. The version from `c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c` (the changes being merged) does the same but wraps the call in curly braces, effectively creating a block for the `if` statement.

Semantically, both versions achieve the same result regarding the functionality of setting `YSmooth` for the widgets and updating `mTotalHeight`. The difference lies in the coding style: one uses a single statement under the `if` condition without braces, and the other uses braces to enclose the statement.

Since the functionality is the same and the difference is purely stylistic, we should consider the intent and the potential impact of resolving the conflict in different ways.

1. **Preserving Functionality**: Both versions preserve the functionality of the original code. The use of braces or not does not affect how the code executes.

2. **Coding Style**: The version with braces is more explicit and can be considered safer or more consistent with some coding standards, especially when dealing with conditional statements that might be extended later.

Given the context, a reasonable resolution is to choose one style and stick to it. However, since the task is to resolve the conflict based on semantics and intent rather than coding style, and both versions have the same semantic intent, we can consider either version as a valid resolution.

Let's resolve the conflict by choosing the version that includes braces for the `if` statement, as it is a common practice to use braces to avoid potential issues when modifying the code in the future.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
        mTotalHeight = WIDGETS_MARGIN;

        for (int i = 0; i < mOpenWidgets.size(); i++) {
            WidgetBase.WidgetContainer widget = mOpenWidgets.get(i);

            if (widget != ignore) {
                widget.setYSmooth(mTotalHeight);
            }

            mTotalHeight += widget.getMeasuredHeight() + mSpacing;
        }
    }


```
