To resolve the merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles some form of data processing or packaging, given the presence of terms like `bags`, `packagers`, `myKey`, and `keyWritable`. The method `getNext()` seems to be designed to retrieve the next item or result in a sequence, throwing an `ExecException` if something goes wrong.

The conflict arises between two lines of code that are trying to assign a value to `origIndex`:

1. `byte origIndex = myKey.getIndex();` from the local (`HEAD`) changes.
2. `byte origIndex = keyWritable.getIndex();` from the changes being merged in (`88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`).

To resolve this, we need to understand the intent behind both `myKey` and `keyWritable`, and their respective `getIndex()` methods. 

- `myKey` and `keyWritable` seem to be objects that hold some form of index or identifier.
- The `getIndex()` method returns the index.

The conflict suggests that there are two different variables (`myKey` and `keyWritable`) being used for potentially the same purpose or a very similar purpose.

Without more context about `myKey` and `keyWritable`, and why one is being replaced or used over the other, it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict based solely on the given snippet.

However, since the rest of the method doesn't reference `origIndex` in a way that gives away whether it should be `myKey` or `keyWritable` specifically, and without knowing the types or the specific intent behind the change (e.g., whether `myKey` is being deprecated in favor of `keyWritable` or vice versa), a safe approach would be to examine the history and surrounding code.

Given the information available and sticking strictly to the task's requirements:

```java
    public Result getNext() throws ExecException {
        if (bags == null) {
            return new Result(POStatus.STATUS_EOP, null);
        }

<<<<<<< HEAD
        byte origIndex = myKey.getIndex();
=======
        byte origIndex = keyWritable.getIndex();
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a

        int index = (int)origIndex;
        index &= idxPart;

        if (index >= packagers.size() || index < 0) {
```
