To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the intent behind the changes on both sides of the conflict.

The code snippet appears to be part of a larger system that handles RPC (Remote Procedure Call) operations, specifically interacting with HBase. The snippet is focused on checking the readability of a certain number of bytes (`length`) from a buffer (`buf`).

On the left-hand side (HEAD), the code manually checks the readability by marking the reader index, skipping the specified number of bytes, and then resetting the reader index. This sequence of operations effectively checks if there are at least `length` bytes readable in the buffer without actually advancing the reader index.

On the right-hand side (d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f), the code uses a method named `ensureReadable(buf, length)` to presumably achieve a similar or the same goal. The name `ensureReadable` suggests that it ensures there are enough readable bytes in the buffer.

Both approaches seem to be checking if the buffer has enough readable bytes. However, they use different methods to achieve this.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand if `ensureReadable(buf, length)` is semantically equivalent to the manual operations performed on the left-hand side. 

If `ensureReadable` not only checks but also potentially handles or throws an exception when there aren't enough readable bytes (similar to or more effectively than the manual check and the caught `IllegalArgumentException`), and if it's a more modern or preferred way of achieving the same check, then it might be a good candidate to replace the manual check.

However, without the exact implementation of `ensureReadable`, it's hard to be certain about its behavior. If `ensureReadable` is simply a more concise or readable (not the same as the "readable" in the context of the buffer) version of the check and does not alter the functionality significantly, it could be a good resolution.

Given the information and focusing on intent and semantics:

1. The manual check on the left ensures there are enough bytes to read and does so in a way that doesn't advance the reader index.
2. The `ensureReadable` call on the right implies a similar check or action.

If `ensureReadable` is correctly implemented to check or ensure the buffer's readability without advancing the index (or handles it appropriately), it seems like a potentially better or more maintainable approach due to its conciseness and readability.

However, to be cautious and without knowing the implementation of `ensureReadable`, if we assume it does a similar check and potentially throws an exception that's caught or handled similarly or better than the `IllegalArgumentException`, we can resolve the conflict by choosing the right-hand side for its conciseness and potentially better handling.

The resolution, in markdown code syntax as requested, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
      try {
        HBaseRpc.checkArrayLength(buf, length);
        // Make sure we have that many bytes readable.
        // This will have to change to be able to do streaming RPCs where we
        // deserialize parts of the response as it comes off the wire.
        ensureReadable(buf, length);
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        LOG.error("WTF?  RPC #" + rpcid + ": ", e);
      }
    }
