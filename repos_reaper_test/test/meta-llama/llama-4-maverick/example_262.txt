To resolve the given merge conflict, we need to analyze the changes made in both branches and understand their intent. The conflict is in the import statements of a Java file, specifically around the import of `POPackage`.

The original code (before the conflict) imports various classes from `org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators`. The conflict arises because one branch (represented by `HEAD`) does not include the import for `POPackage`, while the other branch (represented by `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) does.

Let's consider the possible intent behind the inclusion or exclusion of `POPackage`:
1. The branch `HEAD` might not be using `POPackage` directly, or it might be using it indirectly through another class or package that is already imported. However, without the context of how these classes are used, it's hard to be certain.
2. The other branch (`88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) has added an import for `POPackage`, suggesting that it is using this class. `POPackage` is a class related to packaging in the Pig execution engine, which could be necessary for certain operations like handling data in MapReduce jobs.

Given the information available and sticking strictly to the task of resolving the import conflict:
- If the intent is to include `POPackage` because it's necessary for the functionality introduced or modified in the branch `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`, then we should include the import.
- If `POPackage` is not needed, or its usage is not relevant to the changes made in either branch, then it might not be necessary to include it. However, removing an import that is used can cause compilation errors.

Since the provided snippet does not give away whether `POPackage` is actually used or not, and to avoid potentially introducing a compilation error by removing it, the most straightforward resolution is to include the import for `POPackage` as it seems to be a valid addition based on the context of other imports.

Here's how the resolved snippet would look in markdown code syntax:

```java
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POFRJoin;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POFilter;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POForEach;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POLoad;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POLocalRearrange;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POPackage;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POSkewedJoin;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POSort;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POSplit;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.POStore;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.Packager;
```

This resolution includes `POPackage` in the imports, maintaining consistency with the other branch's changes and assuming its relevance to the overall functionality.
