To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that overrides methods from a superclass or interface, specifically methods related to building HTTP requests (`buildPostRequest` and `buildPutRequest`) using a `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` class.

The conflict is in the `buildPostRequest` method:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest();
=======
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
>>>>>>> f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b
```

On the left side of the conflict (`HEAD`), the `buildPostRequest` method returns a new `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` without passing any arguments to its constructor.

On the right side (`f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b`), the same method returns a new `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` but passes the `url` parameter to its constructor.

To resolve this conflict, we should consider the intent behind both versions. 

1. The version on the left (`HEAD`) suggests that the `url` might not be necessary for constructing a `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` for a POST request, or it might be set elsewhere or in a different way.
   
2. The version on the right (`f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b`) implies that the `url` is necessary or useful for constructing a `MockLowLevelHttpRequest`, similar to how it's done in the `buildRequest` method (not shown in the conflict but visible at the top of the snippet) and presumably in other request building methods.

Given the context and the visible method `buildRequest` which returns `new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url)`, it's reasonable to infer that `url` is typically used when constructing `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` objects. The `buildPostRequest` and `buildPutRequest` methods are likely expected to behave similarly.

Since `buildPutRequest` is not fully shown and is also conflicted (though the conflict markers are not properly closed in the snippet), we should focus on resolving `buildPostRequest` based on available information.

The intent seems to be that `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` should be initialized with a `url` for request building methods. Thus, the version on the right (`return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);`) aligns with the visible pattern in `buildRequest` and likely with the intended behavior.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, with the conflict resolved by choosing the version that aligns with the pattern observed in the `buildRequest` method:

```java
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPostRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPutRequest(String url) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
```
