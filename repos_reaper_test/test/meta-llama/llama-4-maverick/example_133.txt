To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class used in a Hadoop or Pig environment, given the references to `UdfContext`, `Configuration`, and `PigMapBase`. The conflict revolves around the declaration of a `ThreadLocal` variable named `sJobConfInternal`.

On the left side of the conflict (`HEAD`), the `sJobConfInternal` is declared as:
```java
public static ThreadLocal<Configuration> sJobConfInternal = new ThreadLocal<Configuration>();
```

On the right side (`57eb1bac81a4e03e9838c06f642a1432dbbe4e1b`), it is declared with an additional `final` keyword:
```java
public static final ThreadLocal<Configuration> sJobConfInternal = new ThreadLocal<Configuration>();
```

The addition of `final` on the right side indicates an intent to ensure that the `sJobConfInternal` reference cannot be changed once it is initialized. This is a good practice as it makes the code more predictable and thread-safe regarding the reference itself, though it does not affect the thread-local nature of the variable's value.

Both versions of the declaration achieve the same primary functionality: they initialize a `ThreadLocal` variable to hold a `Configuration` object. The `final` keyword adds a constraint that can be beneficial for code clarity and preventing unintended changes to the variable.

Given the context and the intent, the resolution should aim to preserve the functionality and intent of both sides where possible. Since adding `final` does not break any existing functionality and provides an additional safeguard, incorporating this change into the resolved version is reasonable.

Therefore, the resolved code snippet, returned in markdown code syntax as requested, is:

```java
     * <pre>UdfContext.getUdfContext().getJobConf()</pre>
     */
    @Deprecated
    public static Configuration sJobConf = null;

    public static final ThreadLocal<Configuration> sJobConfInternal = new ThreadLocal<Configuration>();

    public static class Map extends PigMapBase {

        @Override
        public void collect(Context oc, Tuple tuple)
```
