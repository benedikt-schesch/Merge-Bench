To resolve the merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet and understand the intent of both sides of the merge.

The conflict is in the declaration of `mMenuTexture`. The local version (`HEAD`) declares it as `private BitmapTexture mMenuTexture;`, while the incoming version (`91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d`) declares it as `private BitmapTextureAtlas mMenuTexture;`.

First, we need to understand the difference between `BitmapTexture` and `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Typically, in the context of game development or graphical applications, a `BitmapTexture` represents a texture that is used to render a bitmap image directly. On the other hand, a `BitmapTextureAtlas` is a larger texture that contains multiple smaller textures (or regions) packed together. This is often used for optimization purposes, as it can reduce the number of texture swaps during rendering.

Given the context that `mMenuTexture` is used in conjunction with `mMenuResetTextureRegion` and `mMenuQuitTextureRegion`, it suggests that `mMenuTexture` is likely being used as a source texture for these regions. This implies that `mMenuTexture` is probably intended to be a `BitmapTextureAtlas` because it contains multiple regions (`mMenuResetTextureRegion` and `mMenuQuitTextureRegion`), which is a common use case for a texture atlas.

Therefore, the intent of the incoming version (`91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d`) seems to be more semantically correct in this context, as it suggests that `mMenuTexture` is being used as an atlas for the menu items.
