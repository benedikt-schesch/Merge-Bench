To resolve the merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes made in both branches.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of an Android application, specifically within a `CameraActivity`. It creates a `ThumbnailFlinger` object and posts a `Runnable` to the `mHandler`, which is likely a UI thread handler. Within this `Runnable`, it adds the `ThumbnailFlinger` view to a layout, sets its rotation, image bitmap, and initiates an animation.

The conflict arises from differing values being set for the rotation of `flinger`. The version from `HEAD` (the local branch being merged) sets the rotation to `mOrientationCompensation + 90`, while the version from `c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c` (the branch being merged into the local branch) sets it to a fixed value of `90`.

To resolve this, let's consider the intent behind both changes:

1. The change from `HEAD` suggests that the rotation should be dynamically calculated based on `mOrientationCompensation`, offset by `90` degrees. This could be to adjust the thumbnail's orientation according to the device's orientation or some other compensation logic.

2. The change from the other branch (`c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c`) simply sets the rotation to `90` degrees, indicating a static adjustment.

Without additional context about `mOrientationCompensation` or the specific requirements of the application, the most straightforward resolution that respects both intents could be to preserve the dynamic adjustment if it seems to serve a purpose like adapting to device orientation. However, if the intent is simply to rotate the thumbnail by a fixed amount, the static value might suffice.

Since we don't have explicit information on whether `mOrientationCompensation` is relevant or should be considered, the resolution could lean towards understanding the application's requirement for handling thumbnail rotation. 

If `mOrientationCompensation` is relevant and necessary for correctly orienting the thumbnail based on the device's state or other factors, then the version from `HEAD` is more appropriate. If, however, the design decision was to simplify or fix the rotation to a specific value regardless of other factors, the other version might be preferred.

Given the information and sticking strictly to the task:

```java
            final ThumbnailFlinger flinger = new ThumbnailFlinger(CameraActivity.this);
            mHandler.post(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    layout.addView(flinger);
<<<<<<< HEAD
                    flinger.setRotation(mOrientationCompensation+90);
=======
                    flinger.setRotation(90);
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
                    flinger.setImageBitmap(info.mThumbnail);
                    flinger.doAnimation();
                }
            });
