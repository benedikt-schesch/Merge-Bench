To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made in both branches.

The provided Java code snippet is part of a class named `ReliefFilter`, which appears to be used for applying a relief effect to a bitmap image. The method `changeToRelief` takes a `Bitmap` object as input and returns a new `Bitmap` with the relief effect applied.

The conflict arises in the lines where the width and height of the input bitmap are retrieved. The conflicting changes are in the lines preceding the retrieval of the bitmap's dimensions.

Let's examine the conflict:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
		       
=======
		        
>>>>>>> 02da86c8cf719b79f992ce365c542e3f1ad0a46b
```
The changes on both sides of the conflict involve adding whitespace (either a newline or possibly some other whitespace characters that aren't visible here). The `HEAD` side has some whitespace (potentially a newline or tabs/spaces), and the other side (`02da86c8cf719b79f992ce365c542e3f1ad0a46b`) has slightly different whitespace.

To resolve this, we should consider the intent behind both changes. Since both sides are essentially adding whitespace without any visible or meaningful difference in terms of code functionality, and there's no indication that this whitespace is crucial for the functionality or readability of the surrounding code, we could simplify by choosing one version. However, given that the exact nature of the whitespace isn't specified and assuming it's just a matter of newline or some other non-significant whitespace difference, the resolution could lean towards removing or standardizing this whitespace.

However, the exact intent (whether it was to add a newline or some specific formatting) isn't clear from the conflict alone. Given the information and sticking strictly to the task:

```java
public class ReliefFilter {
	// 浮雕效果函数
	public static Bitmap changeToRelief(Bitmap mBitmap) {        
		 int mBitmapWidth = 0;
		 int mBitmapHeight = 0;
		        
		 mBitmapWidth = mBitmap.getWidth();
		 mBitmapHeight = mBitmap.getHeight();
		 
		 Bitmap bmpReturn = Bitmap.createBitmap(mBitmapWidth, mBitmapHeight, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888); 
```
