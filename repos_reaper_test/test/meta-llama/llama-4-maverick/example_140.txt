To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The given snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class due to the presence of methods like `start()` and a variable/field `pigContext`. The conflict arises from the addition of a new method `getPigContext()` annotated with `@Private`, which is introduced by the changes coming from the commit `f6a8f7aa42cae344f71cc6759f1c7880b49211fc`.

The original code (before the merge conflict) ends with a `break;` statement within a loop or conditional block, followed by a `start()` method that initializes `startTime` and `userId`. The change from the `HEAD` (the current branch being worked on) does not introduce any new code in the conflict area.

The change from `f6a8f7aa42cae344f71cc6759f1c7880b49211fc` introduces a new method `getPigContext()` that returns `pigContext`. This suggests that `pigContext` is a field within the class, and the new method provides access to it, albeit with a `@Private` annotation which might imply it's intended for internal use or is part of an internal API.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both versions. The `HEAD` version does not modify the code in question, implying that it doesn't need the new method or is not ready to incorporate it yet. The other version (`f6a8f7aa42cae344f71cc6759f1c7880b49211fc`) introduces a getter for `pigContext`, suggesting that accessing `pigContext` is necessary or useful.

Since there's no direct conflict in terms of code changes (the conflict is simply an addition), and assuming that the introduction of `getPigContext()` does not interfere with the existing functionality or intent of the `HEAD`, the resolution involves deciding whether to include the new method.

Given that the introduction of `getPigContext()` seems to be a non-conflicting addition (as it doesn't alter existing code but rather adds new functionality), and without any information suggesting that this addition is incorrect or unnecessary, the resolution would be to include this new method.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    @Private
    public PigContext getPigContext() {
        return pigContext;
    }

    public void start() {
        startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        userId = System.getProperty("user.name");
    }

```
