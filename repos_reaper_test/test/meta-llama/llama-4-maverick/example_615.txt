To resolve the merge conflict, we need to analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The conflicting code is within the `checkV2_5_fanCount` test method. The method is testing the deserialization of a `Page` object from a JSON representation and verifying its properties.

The conflict arises from the fact that both sides of the merge are trying to assert the value of a count related to "likes" on the `page` object, but they are using different method names: `getLikesCount()` and `getLikes()`.

Let's analyze the intent:

1. The left-hand side (HEAD) is asserting that `page.getLikesCount().longValue()` equals `3L`.
2. The right-hand side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe) is asserting that `page.getLikes().longValue()` equals `3L`.

Both assertions are checking the same expected value (`3L`), suggesting that they are testing the same semantic property of the `Page` object. The difference lies in the method used to access this property.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the relationship between `getFanCount()`, `getLikesCount()`, and `getLikes()`. 

- `getFanCount()` is already being asserted to be `3L`, suggesting that it is related to the count of likes or fans of the page.
- Both `getLikesCount()` and `getLikes()` seem to be related to the count of likes, given the context of the assertions.

Without additional information about the `Page` class and its intended semantics, a straightforward resolution would be to remove the conflict by choosing one side. However, the correct choice depends on the actual intent and the definitions of `getLikesCount()` and `getLikes()`.

If `getLikesCount()` and `getLikes()` are semantically equivalent (i.e., both return the count of likes), and considering that `getFanCount()` is also asserted to have the same value, it might imply that all three are related to the same or similar properties of the `Page`.

Given that we are not modifying the context and aiming to preserve the spacing as is, and without further information on the `Page` class, a cautious approach would be to return the snippet as is if we're unsure. However, let's assume a resolution based on typical merge conflict resolution strategies.

```java
  @Test
  public void checkV2_5_fanCount() {
    Page page = createJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonFromClasspath("v2_5/page-with-likes"), Page.class);
    assertNotNull(page);
    assertEquals(3L, page.getFanCount().longValue());
    assertEquals(3L, page.getLikes().longValue());
  }

  @Test
  public void checkV2_6_adminNotes() {
    Page page = createJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonFromClasspath("v2_6/page-with-admin_notes"), Page.class);
```
