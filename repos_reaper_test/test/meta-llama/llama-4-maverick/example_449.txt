To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and includes a test method `parseUrlCode()` that checks the parsing of a URL string into a `Url` object. The test is part of a larger test suite, likely for a parsing or encoding/decoding library.

The conflict arises in the line where the type of the `scheme` object is being asserted to be an instance of `Url.class`. The difference between the two versions is the spacing around the comma in the `assertThat` statement.

- The version from `HEAD` (local changes) has: `assertThat(scheme,instanceOf(Url.class));`
- The version from `7d8e78a2b152062a876d6f8f0f8bde7550278ed0` (incoming changes) has: `assertThat(scheme, instanceOf(Url.class));`

The difference is merely in the presence of a space after the comma. Both lines are semantically equivalent; they check if the `scheme` object is an instance of `Url.class`. The inclusion or exclusion of a space does not change the functionality or the intent of the code.

To resolve this conflict, we can choose either version since they are functionally identical. The standard Java coding conventions suggest having a space after a comma for better readability.

Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by choosing the version with the space after the comma, which is considered more readable and follows standard Java formatting conventions.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing as much as possible:

```java

	@Test
	public void parseUrlCode() throws Exception {
		Object scheme = createParser().parse("http://www.github.org/QRCode");
		assertNotNull(scheme);
		assertThat(scheme, instanceOf(Url.class));
		Url urlCode = (Url) scheme;
		assertEquals("http://www.github.org/QRCode", urlCode.getUrl());
	}

	@Test(expected = UnsupportedEncodingException.class)

```
