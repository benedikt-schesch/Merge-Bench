To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a part of a Java class, specifically a nested static class `UserDevice` that extends `AbstractFacebookType`. This class appears to be part of a larger framework or library for interacting with Facebook, given the mention of "restfb" in the author link.

The conflict arises in the declaration of the `serialVersionUID` field, which is used for serialization purposes in Java. 

On one side of the merge (`HEAD`), there is a declaration of `serialVersionUID` with a value of `1L`. This suggests that the developers on this branch have explicitly defined a version for serialization.

On the other side of the merge (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`), there is no declaration of `serialVersionUID`. This could imply that either the developers on this branch did not consider it necessary to explicitly define `serialVersionUID`, or they intended to rely on the default serialization behavior.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both changes. 

1. If the `serialVersionUID` is explicitly defined on one side, it is typically done to control the versioning of the class for serialization purposes. If the class is being serialized (e.g., saved to a file, sent over a network), having a defined `serialVersionUID` can help manage compatibility between different versions of the class.

2. The absence of `serialVersionUID` on the other side might be due to several reasons, such as not needing to serialize this class, or not having reached a point where serialization compatibility is a concern.

Given the information and focusing on the intent and semantics:

- If the class is intended to be serialized, having a `serialVersionUID` is a good practice. 
- The change on `HEAD` explicitly sets `serialVersionUID`, indicating an intent to manage serialization versioning.
- The other side does not have this explicit definition, which might be due to various reasons, including not having a specific version in mind or not considering serialization at this point.

Since there's no clear indication that the absence of `serialVersionUID` on one side is due to a specific design decision that would conflict with having it on the other side, and given that having a `serialVersionUID` is generally a good practice for serializable classes, we can lean towards preserving the explicit definition of `serialVersionUID`.

Therefore, the resolution could be to keep the `serialVersionUID` declaration as it is on the `HEAD` side, assuming that the intent is to manage serialization versioning.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
   * 
   * @author <a href="http://restfb.com">Norbert Bartels</a>
   */
  public static class UserDevice extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String hardware;

```
