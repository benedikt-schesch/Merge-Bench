To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test case involving Apache Pig, a high-level data processing language and framework. The snippet closes a file writer (`fw1`), runs a Pig job using `PigRunner` with specific arguments, and then asserts that the job is successful. After the job execution, it deletes a local file and an output file on a cluster.

The merge conflict arises from the difference in the lines between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> 57eb1bac81a4e03e9838c06f642a83dbbe4e1b`. The left side of the conflict (between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`) is empty, indicating that the local branch (`HEAD`) has no additional lines or modifications in this section. The right side of the conflict (between `=======` and `>>>>>>> 57eb1bac81a4e03e9838c06f642a83dbbe4e1b`) contains a line with a significant amount of whitespace, which doesn't seem to have any functional impact due to being whitespace.

To understand the intent:
- The local branch (`HEAD`) seems to be focused on the functionality as is, without any additional blank lines or comments in the conflicting section.
- The other branch (`57eb1bac81a4e03e9838c06f642a83dbbe4e1b`) introduced a blank line.

Since the change introduced by the other branch is just a blank line, which doesn't affect the semantics or functionality of the code, and assuming that formatting or readability was the intent behind adding this blank line, we can resolve the conflict by including this blank line.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
        fw1.close();

        try {
           String[] args = { "-x", "local", "-c", PIG_FILE };
           PigStats stats = PigRunner.run(args, null);
       
           assertTrue(stats.isSuccessful());
           assertEquals( 0, stats.getReturnCode() );
        } finally {
            new File(PIG_FILE).delete();
            Util.deleteFile(cluster, OUTPUT_FILE);

```
