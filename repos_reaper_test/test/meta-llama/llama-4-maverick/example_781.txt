To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The method in question is `openScanner`, which is described as a package-private access point for `Scanner`s to open themselves. The return type of this method is subject to a merge conflict. 

The left-hand side (HEAD) of the merge conflict indicates that the return type should be `Deferred<Long>`, while the right-hand side (`d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`) suggests it should be `Deferred<Object>`.

Let's examine the intent and semantics:

1. **Return Type Semantics**: The method's documentation states that it returns "A deferred scanner ID (long) if HBase 0.94 and before, or a deferred {@link Scanner.Response} if HBase 0.95 and up." This indicates that the return type is expected to be different based on the HBase version being used. For HBase 0.94 and before, it's a `Long` (scanner ID), and for HBase 0.95 and up, it's a `Scanner.Response`.

2. **Deferred Type**: The `Deferred` class is likely a type that represents a result that may not be available yet, akin to a `Future` in Java. The type parameter of `Deferred` (e.g., `Long` or `Object`) indicates the type of the result once it becomes available.

Given the documentation, the return type should accommodate both `Long` (for HBase 0.94 and before) and `Scanner.Response` (for HBase 0.95 and up). 

- The left-hand side (`Deferred<Long>`) seems to be specific to the older HBase versions.
- The right-hand side (`Deferred<Object>`) is more generic and could potentially accommodate any type, including both `Long` and `Scanner.Response`, as both can be treated as `Object`.

However, using `Deferred<Object>` could imply that the method's return value could be anything, which might not be type-safe or clear in its intent.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that `Deferred<Object>` is a more flexible return type that can accommodate the different return types for different HBase versions without explicitly using a common superclass or interface that might be more specific than `Object` if one exists.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent and semantics, we should consider what type is most appropriate for the method's return value given its documentation.

```java
   * Package-private access point for {@link Scanner}s to open themselves.
   * @param scanner The scanner to open.
   * @return A deferred scanner ID (long) if HBase 0.94 and before, or a
   * deferred {@link Scanner.Response} if HBase 0.95 and up.
   */
  Deferred<Object> openScanner(final Scanner scanner) {
    num_scanners_opened.increment();
    return sendRpcToRegion(scanner.getOpenRequest()).addCallbacks(
      scanner_opened,
      new Callback<Object, Object>() {
        public Object call(final Object error) {
```

The above resolution returns the snippet with the conflict resolved by choosing `Deferred<Object>` as the return type, which is capable of representing the deferred result for both older and newer HBase versions, albeit with a less specific type.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
   * Package-private access point for {@link Scanner}s to open themselves.
   * @param scanner The scanner to open.
   * @return A deferred scanner ID (long) if HBase 0.94 and before, or a
   * deferred {@link Scanner.Response} if HBase 0.95 and up.
   */
  Deferred<Object> openScanner(final Scanner scanner) {
    num_scanners_opened.increment();
    return sendRpcToRegion(scanner.getOpenRequest()).addCallbacks(
      scanner_opened,
      new Callback<Object, Object>() {
        public Object call(final Object error) {
```
