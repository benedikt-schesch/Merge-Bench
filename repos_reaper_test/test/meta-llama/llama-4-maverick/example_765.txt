To resolve the conflict, let's analyze the intent behind both sides of the merge.

The left-hand side (HEAD) checks two conditions before piggybacking a version request: 
1. `client.server_version < 0` 
2. `!isVersionRequest(payload)`

The right-hand side (`e7ed675fb9763b412458f905c07d274b0ffc12d9`) only checks if `!isVersionRequest(payload)`.

The condition `client.server_version < 0` is likely checking if the server version is unknown. By removing this condition, the right-hand side is essentially piggybacking a version request whenever the payload is not a version request, regardless of whether the server version is known.

To resolve the conflict, we should consider the intent of both changes. The original code (left-hand side) seems to be cautious about piggybacking a version request when the server version is already known. The change on the right-hand side removes this caution.

Since the code on the right-hand side is simpler and does not check for the server version, we can infer that the condition `client.server_version < 0` might not be necessary or is handled elsewhere. Thus, resolving the conflict by taking the right-hand side's change is reasonable. The resolved code is as shown above.
