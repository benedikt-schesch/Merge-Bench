To resolve this merge conflict, we need to analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles game-related operations. The specific method is likely used to retrieve a list of white card data for a player's hand.

The conflict arises in the `else` branch of the method, where two different versions of the code are present.

The version on the left-hand side (`HEAD`) returns a new `ArrayList` with a capacity of 0, explicitly specifying the type parameters as `Map<WhiteCardData, Object>`. This suggests that the method is expected to return a list of maps, where each map contains `WhiteCardData` as keys.

The version on the right-hand side (`5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a`) returns a new `ArrayList` with a capacity of 0, using the diamond operator (`<>`) to infer the type parameters. This implies that the type parameters should be inferred from the method's return type.

To resolve the conflict, we need to determine the intended return type of the method. Although the exact return type is not explicitly specified in the provided snippet, we can make an educated guess based on the context.

Given that the `getWhiteCardData(hand)` method is called in the `if` branch, it's likely that the method is expected to return a list of white card data. The type of `getWhiteCardData(hand)` is not shown, but based on its name, it is reasonable to assume it returns a list related to white card data.

The version on the `HEAD` suggests a more specific type (`Map<WhiteCardData, Object>`), while the version on `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a` is more generic and relies on the method's return type inference.

Since the method's return type is not explicitly shown, let's examine the provided code and context again. The fact that `getWhiteCardData(hand)` is returned in the `if` branch suggests that the return type of the method is likely the same as the type returned by `getWhiteCardData(hand)`. 

However, without knowing the exact return type of `getWhiteCardData(hand)`, it's difficult to definitively resolve the conflict. 

Assuming that the return type of the method is something like `List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>` or a similar type that can be inferred, the version on `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a` seems more modern and idiomatic Java, as it uses the diamond operator for type inference.

If we take the return type to be something that can be represented by an `ArrayList` with inferred type (like `List<SomeType>` where `SomeType` could be `WhiteCardData` or `Map<WhiteCardData, Object>`), the conflict can be resolved by choosing the right-hand side version.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:
```java
      final List<WhiteCard> hand = player.getHand();
      synchronized (hand) {
        return getWhiteCardData(hand);
      }
    } else {
      return new ArrayList<>(0);
    }
  }

  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
