/**
 * Defines the specific characteristics of a Block
``` 

To resolve this merge conflict, we should analyze the intent behind both the local and incoming changes. The local change (HEAD) includes the import statement for `org.spout.math.GenericMath`, while the incoming change removes this import.

Since the context is about defining characteristics of a Block and includes other imports related to mathematical and physical properties, it's likely that `org.spout.math.GenericMath` is used somewhere in this class or related classes for mathematical operations.

Without the actual usage of `GenericMath` in the provided snippet, we can still infer based on common practices:

1. If `GenericMath` is used in the class, removing its import could cause a compilation error. Hence, the local change (keeping the import) is likely necessary if the class utilizes `GenericMath`.
2. If `GenericMath` is not used, many IDEs would typically flag it as an unused import, and it could be safely removed.

Given that the conflict is just about an import statement and assuming that the rest of the code is not provided, the most straightforward resolution is to keep the import if it's used in the class. Otherwise, it can be removed.

Since we don't have the class's full implementation to check if `GenericMath` is used, and to preserve the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge (considering the local change includes the import and the incoming change removes it), a safe resolution would be to keep the import statement if it's used. However, without further context, we'll keep the resolved version as is because it includes the import statement.

The resolved snippet is provided at the top. It includes the import for `org.spout.math.GenericMath` as per the local version (HEAD), assuming it's utilized within the class or related classes.
