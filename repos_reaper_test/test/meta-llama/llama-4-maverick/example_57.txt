To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that manages a card game, specifically checking if certain conditions are met regarding the number of black and white cards available.

The conflict arises in the following section:

```java
      final WhiteDeck tempWhiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
<<<<<<< HEAD
      if (tempWhiteDeck.totalCount() < getRequiredWhiteCardCount()) {
        return false;
      }

      return true;
=======
      return tempWhiteDeck.totalCount() >= getRequiredWhiteCardCount();
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
```

Let's break down what both sides are doing:

1. **Left side (HEAD):**
   - It checks if `tempWhiteDeck.totalCount()` is less than `getRequiredWhiteCardCount()`.
   - If it is, the method returns `false`.
   - If not, it implicitly means `tempWhiteDeck.totalCount()` is greater than or equal to `getRequiredWhiteCardCount()`, and the method returns `true`.

2. **Right side (5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a):**
   - It directly returns the result of the condition `tempWhiteDeck.totalCount() >= getRequiredWhiteCardCount()`, which is a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

Both sides are essentially checking the same condition: whether `tempWhiteDeck.totalCount()` is greater than or equal to `getRequiredWhiteCardCount()`. They just express this check differently:

- The left side uses an `if` statement to return `false` if the condition is not met and `true` otherwise.
- The right side directly returns the result of the condition.

The intent is the same on both sides: to return `true` if there are enough white cards (as determined by `getRequiredWhiteCardCount()`) and `false` otherwise.

Since both sides achieve the same result semantically, the conflict can be resolved by choosing one of the two versions. The right side is more concise and directly returns the result of the comparison, making it a slightly more efficient and readable version.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
      if (tempBlackDeck.totalCount() < MINIMUM_BLACK_CARDS) {
        return false;
      }

      final WhiteDeck tempWhiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
      return tempWhiteDeck.totalCount() >= getRequiredWhiteCardCount();
    }
  }

  /**
   * Deal cards for this round. The game immediately then moves into the {@code PLAYING} state.
