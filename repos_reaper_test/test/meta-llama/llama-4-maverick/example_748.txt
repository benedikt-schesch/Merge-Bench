To resolve the merge conflict, we need to analyze the context and the changes brought in by both sides of the merge.

The given snippet is in Java and involves import statements. The conflict arises from the fact that the local branch (`HEAD`) and the branch being merged (`87ea390f230ec36969747fc3473a990c8b5f1864`) have different sets of import statements.

Let's examine the changes:

1. The `HEAD` (local branch) includes imports related to `samoa.topology.impl` package, specifically `ParallelComponentFactory`, `ParallelEngine`, `SimpleComponentFactory`, and `SimpleEngine`, alongside other imports like `Task` from `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.tasks`.

2. The branch being merged (`87ea390f230ec36969747fc3473a990c8b5f1864`) removes the imports related to `samoa.topology.impl` package but retains `Task` from `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.tasks` and adds imports from `com.github.javacliparser` package.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both sets of changes.

The `HEAD` seems to be using or referencing classes related to topology implementations (`ParallelComponentFactory`, `ParallelEngine`, `SimpleComponentFactory`, `SimpleEngine`), suggesting that the code might be utilizing these classes for some functionality, possibly related to task execution or processing topology.

The branch being merged (`87ea390f230ec36969747fc3473a990c8b5f1864`), on the other hand, appears to be removing the topology implementation imports, possibly indicating a refactoring or change in how the topology is handled or instantiated. Additionally, it introduces imports from `com.github.javacliparser`, which could imply the addition of command-line argument parsing functionality.

Since both sides retain the import for `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.tasks.Task`, it suggests that `Task` is still a relevant and necessary class for the functionality being developed or maintained.

To resolve the conflict semantically, we should consider whether the removal of the `samoa.topology.impl` imports and the introduction of `javacliparser` imports are compatible with the intent of the `HEAD`. If the changes are meant to coexist (i.e., the code needs both the topology implementations and the command-line parsing functionality), then we should ensure that all necessary imports are preserved.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import com.github.javacliparser.ClassOption;
import com.github.javacliparser.FlagOption;
import com.github.javacliparser.IntOption;
import com.github.javacliparser.Option;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.tasks.Task;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.impl.ParallelComponentFactory;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.impl.ParallelEngine;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.impl.SimpleComponentFactory;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.impl.SimpleEngine;
```

This resolution combines the imports from both sides, assuming that the code intends to utilize both the topology implementation classes and the command-line parsing functionality. However, if there's a logical conflict or if the merged code doesn't compile due to incompatible changes, further investigation into the code's intent and the necessity of each import is required.
