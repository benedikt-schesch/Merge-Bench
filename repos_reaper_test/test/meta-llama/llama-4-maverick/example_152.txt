To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test or an example related to Apache Pig, a high-level data processing language and framework. The snippet creates a Pig script as a string, which is then parsed using a `GruntParser`. The script reads data using `PigStorage`, filters it based on a condition (`uid > 5`), dumps the result, and stores it into a file.

The merge conflict arises from the line where a `GruntParser` object is instantiated. The conflict is between two versions of this line:

1. `GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));` (from the `HEAD` side)
2. `GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);` (from the `2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea` side)

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes.

- The `HEAD` version uses the original constructor of `GruntParser` that takes a single argument, a `StringReader` object containing the Pig script to be parsed.
- The other version (`2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea`) modifies the instantiation to include an additional argument, `myPig`, suggesting that the `GruntParser` constructor has been modified or overloaded to accept a second parameter, potentially to provide additional context or configuration (e.g., a `Pig` object or similar) to the parser.

Without knowing the specifics of what `myPig` represents or the changes made to the `GruntParser` class, we can still infer that the change is likely intended to enhance or modify the parsing behavior, possibly by providing additional context or configuration.

To resolve the conflict, we should consider whether the change represented by the `2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea` side is necessary or beneficial for the functionality intended by the code in `HEAD`. If `myPig` is a required or useful parameter for the `GruntParser` (for example, for configuration or context), and its inclusion does not break the functionality intended by the `HEAD` version, then the conflict should be resolved in favor of the version that includes `myPig`.

However, without further information about the `GruntParser` class and the purpose of `myPig`, the safest resolution that preserves the potential intent of both sides (if they are not mutually exclusive) would be to choose the version that includes the additional parameter, assuming it is a valid and necessary change.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "dump b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```
