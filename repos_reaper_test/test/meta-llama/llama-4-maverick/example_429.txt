To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the code snippet and understand the intent of both sides of the merge.

The code is written in Java and appears to be part of a larger application, possibly an Android app given the presence of `R.string.unmatched` and the use of specific adapter classes. The snippet deals with managing a list of videos, specifically handling a case where a video is considered "unmatched."

The conflict arises in two places within the given snippet:

1. The casting of `row.getAdapter()` to either `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` or `SortedObjectAdapter`.
2. The declaration and initialization of `listRowAdapter` as either `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` or `SortedObjectAdapter`.

Let's examine the intent behind these changes:

- The `HEAD` version uses `SortedArrayObjectAdapter`, suggesting that the adapter for the "unmatched" list row should be or was intended to be of this type. This could imply that the application expects or previously expected this specific adapter type for certain functionality, possibly related to sorting or array-specific operations.
  
- The version from `308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5` uses `SortedObjectAdapter`, indicating a change or an update where `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` is either deprecated, renamed, or replaced with `SortedObjectAdapter`. This change suggests a shift towards using a more generic or differently named adapter class that still supports sorting.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the semantic intent behind both versions. If `SortedObjectAdapter` is a new or updated class that is intended to replace `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` and provides the necessary functionality (i.e., it supports adding objects and is compatible with the rest of the application's logic), then the change towards using `SortedObjectAdapter` is likely intended to be kept.

Given this analysis, the resolution involves choosing one version over the other based on the intended functionality and the application's evolution. Since `SortedObjectAdapter` seems to be the updated or preferred class (as indicated by its presence in the later commit), we'll proceed with that.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
            ListRow row = findListRow(getString(R.string.unmatched));

            // if found add this video
            // if not, create a new row and add it
            if (row != null) {
                ((SortedObjectAdapter) row.getAdapter()).add(video);
            } else {
                SortedObjectAdapter listRowAdapter = new SortedObjectAdapter(
                        videoNameComparator, mCardPresenter);
                listRowAdapter.add(video);

                HeaderItem header = new HeaderItem(0, getString(R.string.unmatched), null);
                int index = mAdapter.size() > 1 ? mAdapter.size() - 1 : 0;
