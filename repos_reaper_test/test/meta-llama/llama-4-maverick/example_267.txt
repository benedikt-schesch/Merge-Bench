To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the code snippet and understand the intent behind both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a part of a Java method `createDataBag(int numBags)` which appears to be responsible for creating a `DataBag` based on certain conditions. The conflict arises in the way the `bagType` variable is being retrieved from the job configuration.

### Analyzing the Conflict

The conflicting section is:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
               bagType = PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get().get("pig.cachedbag.type");
           }
=======
            bagType = PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get().get("pig.cachedbag.type");
        }
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a
```

- The left side of the conflict (represented by `<<<<<<< HEAD`) retrieves the `bagType` from the job configuration if `PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get()` is not null, and it seems to be correctly checking for the null condition but has an extra indentation level.
- The right side of the conflict (represented by `>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) also retrieves the `bagType` under the same null condition check but is properly aligned.

### Understanding the Intent

Both sides of the conflict are essentially performing the same operation: checking if `PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get()` is not null and then retrieving the "pig.cachedbag.type" from it. The difference lies in the indentation and the closing bracket position.

The intent seems to be to safely retrieve the `bagType` without causing a `NullPointerException`, which both versions achieve. However, the left side has an inconsistent indentation.

### Resolving the Conflict

To resolve the conflict, we need to ensure that the code is not only syntactically correct but also semantically consistent with the intent. The correct indentation and the closing bracket are crucial for understanding the scope of the `if` condition.

Here is the resolution:
```java
    }

    private DataBag createDataBag(int numBags) {
        String bagType = null;
        if (PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get() != null) {
            bagType = PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get().get("pig.cachedbag.type");
        }

        if (bagType != null && bagType.equalsIgnoreCase("default")) {
            return new NonSpillableDataBag();
        }
        return new InternalCachedBag(numBags);

```
The resolution involves taking the right side's version of the conflicting lines because it correctly aligns with the `if` statement and properly closes the `if` block. The resulting code snippet is:

```java
    }

    private DataBag createDataBag(int numBags) {
        String bagType = null;
        if (PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get() != null) {
            bagType = PigMapReduce.sJobConfInternal.get().get("pig.cachedbag.type");
        }

        if (bagType != null && bagType.equalsIgnoreCase("default")) {
            return new NonSpillableDataBag();
        }
        return new InternalCachedBag(numBags);
```
