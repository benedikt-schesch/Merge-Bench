To resolve the merge conflict in the given Java code snippet, let's first understand the context and the changes made in both branches.

The code snippet is a part of a Java class or interface that deals with geographical or spatial representations, likely in a game or simulation environment, given the presence of imports like `org.spout.api.geo.World` and `org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Block`. The merge conflict occurs in the import statements.

The conflict arises between two commits:
- The commit represented by `HEAD` (the current branch) has the import statement `import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;`.
- The commit represented by `cc0703054530b4eeda07a2b1b619ed34e1e7d201` (the other branch being merged) has two import statements: `import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region;` and `import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;`.

The intent behind the changes in `HEAD` seems to be using `Vector3` from `org.spout.math.vector`, while the other branch is using `Vector3` from `org.spout.api.math` and also introducing `Region` from `org.spout.api.geo.cuboid`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the semantics and intent:
1. The `Vector3` class is being imported from different packages in the two branches. `org.spout.api.math.Vector3` seems to be the more appropriate or updated package given the namespace `org.spout.api`, which is likely the API's namespace, suggesting it's part of the public or intended API of the Spout framework. `org.spout.math.vector.Vector3` might be an older or internal package.
2. The introduction of `org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region` in the other branch indicates an addition or a change that involves working with regions in the world or spatial representation.

Considering these points, the resolution should aim at preserving the functionality or intent of both branches where possible.

Here's the resolution:

```java
import org.spout.api.geo.LoadOption;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.WorldSource;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Block;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.util.StringUtil;

/**
 * Represents a position in a World
 */
```

This resolution includes `Region` as introduced by the other branch, and it uses `Vector3` from `org.spout.api.math`, which is likely the intended or more appropriate version given the context of other imports being from `org.spout.api`. The import for `Vector3` from `org.spout.math.vector` is removed as it conflicts with the version from `org.spout.api.math`, assuming the latter is the more current or appropriate choice.

The original snippet with the conflict is:
```java
import org.spout.api.geo.LoadOption;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.WorldSource;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Block;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
=======
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
>>>>>>> cc0703054530b4eeda07a2b1b619ed34e1e7d201
import org.spout.api.util.StringUtil;

/**
 * Represents a position in a World
 */
```

And the resolved version in markdown code syntax as requested is:
```java
import org.spout.api.geo.LoadOption;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.WorldSource;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Block;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.util.StringUtil;

/**
 * Represents a position in a World
 */
```
