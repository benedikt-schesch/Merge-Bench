<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.io.BufferedInputStream;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
``` 

To resolve the conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet. The conflict lies in the import statements, where the local changes (`HEAD`) have imported `java.io.BufferedInputStream`, while the incoming changes (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) have imported `java.io.BufferedReader`.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the two imports serve different purposes. `BufferedInputStream` is used for buffered input operations on byte streams, whereas `BufferedReader` is used for buffered input operations on character streams.

Without more context about how these imports are being utilized in the code, it's challenging to determine the intent behind each import. However, it's possible that both imports are necessary for different parts of the class or for handling different types of input.

Given the information available, a reasonable resolution would be to include both imports. Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java

 * limitations under the License.

package org.apache.pig.impl.io;

import java.io.BufferedInputStream;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
```

However, as per the task's requirements to not modify the context and return the original snippet if unsure, the correct response should be the original snippet with the conflict:
