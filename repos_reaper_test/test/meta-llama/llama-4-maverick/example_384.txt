To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The provided Java code snippet appears to be part of a larger class, likely used for text manipulation or UI updates, given the presence of `mTextView` and operations performed on it. The conflict arises from changes made in two different branches or versions of the code (indicated by `HEAD` and the commit hash `0b628c40c6a74e31e3c63b0b545670b5fc2b68c0`).

The conflict is marked by Git's conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> 0b628c40c6a74e31e3c63b0b545670b5fc2b68c0`). The code between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` represents the changes made in the local branch (`HEAD`), while the code between `=======` and `>>>>>>> 0b628c40c6a74e31e3c63b0b545670b5fc2b68c0` represents the changes made in the other branch (the one being merged into the current branch).

Upon examining the conflict, we see that:
- The `HEAD` version (local changes) has no code between the conflict markers.
- The version being merged (`0b628c40c6a74e31e3c63b0b545670b5fc2b68c0`) also effectively adds no code, as the area between the markers is empty.

The code surrounding the conflict is:
```java
mTextView.setText(mTextView.getEditableText().delete(0, mTextView.getText().toString().split("\n", 2)[0].length()+1));
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        } else {
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        }
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

>>>>>>> 0b628c40c6a74e31e3c63b0b545670b5fc2b68c0
        mTextView.setTextSize(mOptions.textSize);
        mTextView.append("\n");
    }

    @Override
```

The conflict here is essentially about an empty change on both sides. The code in question doesn't actually change any logic or functionality due to the merge; it's as if both branches didn't introduce any new code in this specific section.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the original spacing and not modifying the context:
```java
            mTextView.setText(mTextView.getEditableText().delete(0, mTextView.getText().toString().split("\n", 2)[0].length()+1));
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        } else {
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        }
        mTextView.setTextSize(mOptions.textSize);
        mTextView.append("\n");
    }

    @Override
```

This resolution removes the conflict markers and the empty lines they enclosed, effectively resolving the conflict by acknowledging that no actual change was introduced by either side in this specific part of the code. The functionality remains unchanged.

The reasoning is based on understanding that both sides of the merge didn't introduce any meaningful changes within the conflict area. Thus, removing the conflict markers and keeping the surrounding code intact is the most straightforward resolution.

Here is the resolution in the requested markdown code syntax:
```java
            mTextView.setText(mTextView.getEditableText().delete(0, mTextView.getText().toString().split("\n", 2)[0].length()+1));
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        } else {
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        }
        mTextView.setTextSize(mOptions.textSize);
        mTextView.append("\n");
    }

    @Override
```
