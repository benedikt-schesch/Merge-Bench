To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a Jenkins plugin or a similar application, given the import statements referencing Jenkins and related libraries. The conflict arises from the import statements, specifically around the line importing `org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.DoNotUse`.

On the left-hand side (HEAD), we have:
```java
import org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.DoNotUse;
```
This line is importing a restriction annotation named `DoNotUse`, which is likely used to mark certain classes, methods, or fields as not intended for use, possibly due to being deprecated, unstable, or for internal use only.

On the right-hand side (f2aea1563fc4d150c8231efbb2ad89a0a539f166), this import statement is absent.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both versions.

1. **Understanding the intent of the left-hand side (HEAD):** The presence of `import org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.DoNotUse;` suggests that somewhere in the code, the `@DoNotUse` annotation is being utilized. This could be to restrict or document certain elements as not intended for general use.

2. **Understanding the intent of the right-hand side (f2aea1563fc4d150c8231efbb2ad89a0a539f166):** The absence of this import statement implies that either the `@DoNotUse` annotation is not being used in the code, or it's not necessary (perhaps due to other changes or refactorings that removed its usage).

To resolve the conflict, we should check if the `@DoNotUse` annotation is actually used in the code. If it is used, then removing the import (as done on the right-hand side) would result in a compilation error unless the usage is also removed or refactored. If it's not used, then the import on the left-hand side is unnecessary.

Without the context of how `DoNotUse` is used (or not used) in the code, the safest resolution is to preserve the conflict as is because we cannot be certain of the intent without more information.
