To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides.

The code snippet is written in Java and defines a static inner class `VideoStatus` within another class (not shown in the snippet). This inner class represents the "Video Status Graph API type" as per the Facebook Graph API documentation.

The conflict arises due to the differing versions of the code on the two branches being merged. The code on the `HEAD` ( likely the current branch being worked on) includes a declaration for `serialVersionUID`, a version number used during the serialization process in Java. The other branch (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) does not have this declaration.

Let's consider the intent and semantics:

1. **Serialization**: The presence of `serialVersionUID` in the `HEAD` version indicates that the class `VideoStatus` is intended to be serialized. Serialization is the process of converting an object's state into a byte stream. The `serialVersionUID` is a unique identifier for the class and is used to verify the compatibility of the class during the serialization and deserialization process.

2. **AbstractFacebookType**: The class `VideoStatus` extends `AbstractFacebookType`, suggesting it's part of a larger framework or library that interacts with Facebook's Graph API. The base class might implement `Serializable`, making `VideoStatus` implicitly `Serializable` as well.

Given these considerations, the inclusion of `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;` in the `HEAD` version is likely to ensure proper serialization and deserialization of `VideoStatus` objects. Without this declaration, the Java compiler will generate a default `serialVersionUID` based on the class's structure, which can lead to issues if the class structure changes in the future.

The other branch does not include this line, potentially indicating that either serialization is not a concern for this class in that branch, or the change was not necessary or was made in a different commit.

To resolve the conflict, we should consider whether `VideoStatus` needs to be serialized. Given that `AbstractFacebookType` is likely a base class that might be serializable (common in frameworks that deal with API responses or data that needs to be persisted or transmitted), it's reasonable to keep the `serialVersionUID` declaration to ensure control over the serialization version.

Therefore, the resolution should be to keep the `serialVersionUID` declaration, as it is likely important for maintaining control over the serialization process.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
   * Represents the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/video-status/">Video Status Graph
   * API type</a>.
   */
  public static class VideoStatus extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * Status of a video.
     * 
     * Either "ready" (uploaded, encoded, thumbnails extracted), "processing" (not ready yet) or "error" (processing
     * failed).
