To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The given code snippet is in Java, and it appears to be part of a class that manages game information. The method `getInfo` is used to retrieve general information about a game, such as its ID, host, state, and player list.

The conflict arises in the line where a new `HashMap` is instantiated. The two versions are:
- `final Map<GameInfo, Object> info = new HashMap<GameInfo, Object>();` from the local changes (HEAD).
- `final Map<GameInfo, Object> info = new HashMap<>();` from the changes being merged (5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a).

Let's analyze the intent and semantics:
1. Both versions are initializing a `HashMap` to store game information.
2. The difference lies in how the `HashMap` is initialized. The local version explicitly specifies the type parameters (`GameInfo, Object`), while the version being merged uses the diamond operator (`<>`), which allows the compiler to infer the type parameters based on the declaration.

The diamond operator (`<>`) is a feature introduced in Java 7, which simplifies the instantiation of generic classes by allowing the compiler to infer the type arguments. Using `new HashMap<>();` is semantically equivalent to `new HashMap<GameInfo, Object>();` when the variable is declared as `Map<GameInfo, Object> info`, as the compiler can infer that the type parameters for `HashMap` should be `GameInfo` and `Object`.

Given this understanding, both versions achieve the same result, but the version being merged (`new HashMap<>();`) is more concise and considered better practice in Java 7 and later versions.

To resolve the conflict, we can choose the version that is more idiomatic for the Java version being used. Assuming the project is using Java 7 or later, the more modern and concise syntax is preferred.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
   *                        sent to people in the game.
   * @return This game's general information: ID, host, state, player list, etc.
   */
  @Nullable
  public Map<GameInfo, Object> getInfo(final boolean includePassword) {
    final Map<GameInfo, Object> info = new HashMap<>();
    info.put(GameInfo.ID, id);
    // This is probably happening because the game ceases to exist in the middle of getting the
    // game list. Just return nothing.
    if (null == host) {
      return null;

```
