To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is from a Java class `UrlEncodedParser` and is part of the documentation for a method or class related to parsing URL-encoded data. The documentation explains how the parser handles declared fields of type `Collection` and how it deals with input parameters that do not have a corresponding declared field.

The conflict arises from the difference in the documentation between the two versions being merged. The version from `HEAD` (the current branch) has a paragraph that is not present in the version from the commit `01a6cc54669b5ebf1ea1c3e27e424bba99a0ef3c`. The conflicting paragraph discusses what happens when there is no declared field for an input parameter name.

Let's analyze the intent and semantics:

1. **Understanding the Change in `HEAD`**: The paragraph in `HEAD` explains the behavior when there's no declared field for an input parameter. It mentions that unless the input `data` parameter is a `Map`, such parameters are ignored. If it is a `Map`, the parameter value is stored as a string or as an `ArrayList<String>` for repeated parameters.

2. **Understanding the Change in the Other Commit**: The other version (from the commit `01a6cc54669b5ebf1ea1c3e27e424bba99a0ef3c`) seems to be missing the closing `</p>` tag in the subsequent paragraph. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the content is almost identical except for the presence of the closing `</p>` tag.

Given the information and analyzing the intent:

- Both versions are documenting the behavior of the parser regarding undeclared fields and input parameters.
- The main difference is the presence of the closing `</p>` tag in the `HEAD` version, which is necessary for proper HTML formatting.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent and semantics of both sides, we should ensure that the documentation is accurate and properly formatted.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
   * parameter is the declared field class. Declared fields of type {@link Collection} are used to
   * support repeating data key names, so each member of the collection is an additional data key
   * value. They are parsed the same as "primitive" fields, except that the generic type parameter
   * of the collection is used as the {@link Class} parameter.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * If there is no declared field for an input parameter name, it will be ignored unless the input
   * {@code data} parameter is a {@link Map}. If it is a map, the parameter value will be stored
   * either as a string, or as a {@link ArrayList}&lt;String&gt; in the case of repeated parameters.
   * </p>
```

The resolution involves keeping the paragraph explaining the behavior for undeclared fields (from `HEAD`) and ensuring the HTML formatting is correct by including the closing `</p>` tag. This maintains the semantic intent of both versions and resolves the conflict.
