To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the intent behind the changes on both sides of the conflict.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of an Android application, given the presence of an `Intent` and `startActivity` call. The method `openCommits` seems to be responsible for opening a list of commits for a selected branch in a Git repository.

The conflict arises in the line where `repoInfo.branch` is being assigned a value. The two conflicting changes are:
1. `repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getName();` (from the `HEAD` side, presumably the local or current branch)
2. `repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getCommit().getSha();` (from the other side, with commit hash `42bfc423b52bed1c5d64d35cc1100a32b48968d6`)

Let's analyze the intent behind these changes:

1. The change from `HEAD` suggests that the branch name is being passed. This could be used to display the branch name in the `BranchCommitsActivity` or to fetch commits based on the branch name.

2. The change from the other commit (with hash `42bfc423b52bed1c5d64d35cc1100a32b48968d6`) indicates that the SHA of the latest commit on the selected branch is being passed. This could be used to fetch commits starting from a specific point (the latest commit on the branch) or for other Git operations that require a commit SHA.

Without knowing the specifics of how `BranchCommitsActivity` uses `repoInfo.branch`, we can still infer that both changes are attempting to provide relevant information about the selected branch to this activity.

However, given that these two values serve different purposes (one is a human-readable branch name, and the other is a unique commit identifier), simply choosing one over the other might not be the best solution if the activity requires or could benefit from both pieces of information.

That said, to resolve the conflict directly as presented, we need to decide on a single value for `repoInfo.branch`. 

Since the conflict is directly related to what value should be assigned to `repoInfo.branch`, let's consider the possibility that both sides are trying to achieve something different but related. If `BranchCommitsActivity` is designed to work with a commit SHA (which is more specific and uniquely identifies a point in the Git history), the second change might be more appropriate. However, without more context on how `repoInfo.branch` is used, this is speculative.

To directly resolve the conflict by choosing one of the existing options, we can pick the change that seems more likely to be correct based on typical Git operations. Using a commit SHA can be more useful for identifying a specific point in the repository's history.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict resolved by choosing the version from the other commit (since it provides a more specific identifier):
```java
  private void openCommits() {
    if (selectedBranch != null) {
      RepoInfo repoInfo = new RepoInfo();
      repoInfo.owner = repo.getOwner().getLogin();
      repoInfo.name = repo.name;
      repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getCommit().getSha();
      Intent intent = BranchCommitsActivity.createLauncherIntent(this, repoInfo);
      startActivity(intent);
    }
  }


```
However, the task requires returning the entire snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context or spacing, and to preserve the original conflict if the intent is ambiguous.

Given the ambiguity around the exact requirement of `BranchCommitsActivity`, the most appropriate response is to return the original snippet with the conflict, as the intent behind the two conflicting lines is not clear enough to make a definitive resolution.

```java
  private void openCommits() {
    if (selectedBranch != null) {
      RepoInfo repoInfo = new RepoInfo();
      repoInfo.owner = repo.getOwner().getLogin();
      repoInfo.name = repo.name;
<<<<<<< HEAD
      repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getName();
=======
      repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getCommit().getSha();
>>>>>>> 42bfc423b52bed1c5d64d35cc1100a32b48968d6
      Intent intent = BranchCommitsActivity.createLauncherIntent(this, repoInfo);
      startActivity(intent);
    }
  }
