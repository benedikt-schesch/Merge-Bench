To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a part of a Java class, specifically a constructor for `PleaseThrottleException`. The constructor takes four parameters: `msg`, `cause`, `rpc`, and `deferred`. The conflict arises in the type declaration of the `deferred` parameter.

On the left side of the conflict (`HEAD`), the `deferred` parameter is declared as `final Deferred deferred`. On the right side (`d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`), it is declared as `final Deferred<?> deferred`.

The change from `Deferred` to `Deferred<?>` introduces a generic type parameter `?`, which is a wildcard representing an unknown type. This change is likely intended to make the `Deferred` class type-safe by specifying that it can hold any type.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions. The original code (left side) uses a raw type `Deferred`, which might lead to warnings about unchecked operations if `Deferred` is defined with type parameters. The updated code (right side) uses a parameterized type `Deferred<?>`, which is safer as it explicitly indicates that the type parameter is unknown.

Given that the change to `Deferred<?>` is likely aimed at improving type safety without restricting the type that `Deferred` can represent, and assuming that the rest of the codebase is compatible with this change (since it's a more specific and safer type declaration), the resolution should favor the more type-safe version.

Thus, the conflict can be resolved by choosing the right side's version (`final Deferred<?> deferred`), as it maintains backward compatibility while enhancing type safety.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
   * @param deferred A deferred one can wait on before retrying the failed RPC.
   */
  PleaseThrottleException(final String msg,
                          final HBaseException cause,
                          final HBaseRpc rpc,
                          final Deferred<?> deferred) {
    super(msg, cause);
    this.rpc = rpc;
    this.deferred = deferred;
  }
