/**

To resolve the conflict, I analyzed the changes made on both sides. The change on the left (HEAD) modifies the text to reference the HTTP Media-type specification, while the change on the right (2ed19b71ea730095e23224b02a1aa0791ed10dab) achieves a similar goal but with a slight rewording and updates the link to use HTTPS. 

The intent on both sides is to correctly reference the HTTP Media-type specification. The version on the right is more comprehensive as it not only updates the link to HTTPS (which is a good practice for security) but also rephrases the sentence to be more concise and directly linked to the term "HTTP RFC." 

Therefore, I have chosen the version on the right as the resolution because it improves the security and readability of the documentation. The change is straightforward and does not introduce any ambiguity or conflict with the surrounding context.
