To resolve the given merge conflict, I will first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles exceptions related to HBase, a distributed database built on top of Hadoop. The conflict arises in the Javadoc comment of a method named `deserializeException`.

The method `deserializeException` is used to de-serialize an exception from a given buffer. The conflict is about the description of this method.

On one side of the merge (`HEAD`), the method is simply described as "De-serializes an exception." 

On the other side of the merge (`d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`), the description is more specific: "De-serializes an exception from HBase 0.94 and before."

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both descriptions. The first description is generic and does not provide specific information about the version of HBase it supports. The second description is more specific, indicating that this method is particularly for de-serializing exceptions from older versions of HBase (0.94 and before).

Since the second description provides more context and does not contradict the functionality that the method name suggests, and considering that specifying the version can be helpful for users of this method, I will lean towards incorporating the more specific description.

Here is the resolution:

```java
      return new InvalidResponseException(e.getMessage(), e);
    }
  }

  /**
   * De-serializes an exception from HBase 0.94 and before.
   * @param buf The buffer to read from.
   * @param request The RPC that caused this exception.
   */
  static HBaseException deserializeException(final ChannelBuffer buf,
                                             final HBaseRpc request) {
```
