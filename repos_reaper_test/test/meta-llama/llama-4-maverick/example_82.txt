To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class used for representing a black card in a card game, likely "Cards Against Humanity" (CAH) given the package names and variable names like `text`, `draw`, `pick`, and `watermark`.

The conflict arises from the constructor of the class. The left side of the conflict (`HEAD:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomBlackCard.java`) has a constructor named `CustomBlackCard` which takes five parameters: `id`, `text`, `draw`, `pick`, and `watermark`. 

The right side of the conflict (`5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/cardcast/CardcastBlackCard.java`) has a constructor named `CardcastBlackCard` which also takes five parameters but with the last one being `deckId` instead of `watermark`.

Let's analyze the intent:

1. The class on the left side is `CustomBlackCard`, and it's assigning the `watermark` parameter to the `watermark` field.
2. The class on the right side is `CardcastBlackCard`, and it's assigning the `deckId` parameter to the `watermark` field.

The field `watermark` is common in both classes, suggesting it serves a similar purpose. However, the parameter name on the right side is `deckId`, indicating it might represent a different or more specific concept (an identifier for a deck) compared to the more generic term `watermark`.

Given this context, the merge conflict is not just about resolving a textual conflict but understanding the semantic intent behind the changes.

Since the two constructors are for seemingly different classes (`CustomBlackCard` and `CardcastBlackCard`) and the fields are being used similarly but with different parameter names, the most straightforward resolution isn't directly merging the two constructors into one. Instead, we need to consider if these should remain as separate classes or if there's a common base class or interface they could adhere to.

However, based on the information provided, it seems these are distinct classes (`CustomBlackCard` and `CardcastBlackCard`), likely used in different contexts within the application.

To resolve the conflict in a way that maintains the intent of both sides, we should not directly merge the constructors. The correct resolution depends on whether these classes are related and should share a common base or if they are distinct.

Given the information and the task constraints:

```java
  private final String text;
  private final int draw;
  private final int pick;
  private final String watermark;
  private final int id;

<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomBlackCard.java
  public CustomBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick, final String watermark) {
=======
  public CardcastBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick,
                           final String deckId) {
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/cardcast/CardcastBlackCard.java
    this.id = id;
    this.text = text;
    this.draw = draw;
    this.pick = pick;
    this.watermark = watermark;
```

However, upon closer inspection, we see that the `watermark` field is being assigned `watermark` on the left side and implicitly should be assigned `deckId` on the right side. To make the conflict explicit and given that the task doesn't allow for a deeper refactoring or providing additional context beyond what's given:

```java
  private final String text;
  private final int draw;
  private final int pick;
  private final String watermark;

<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomBlackCard.java
  public CustomBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick, final String watermark) {
=======
  public CardcastBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick,
                           final String deckId) {
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/cardcast/CardcastBlackCard.java
    this.id = id;
    this.text = text;
    this.draw = draw;
    this.pick = pick;
<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomBlackCard.java
    this.watermark = watermark;
=======
    this.watermark = deckId;
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/cardcast/CardcastBlackCard.java
```

Thus, returning the snippet with the conflict as is, or making the assignment explicit on both sides:

```java
  private final String text;
  private final int draw;
  private final int pick;
  private final String watermark;
  private final int id;

<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomBlackCard.java
  public CustomBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick, final String watermark) {
    this.id = id;
    this.text = text;
    this.draw = draw;
    this.pick = pick;
    this.watermark = watermark;
=======
  public CardcastBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick,
                           final String deckId) {
    this.id = id;
    this.text = text;
    this.draw = draw;
    this.pick = pick;
    this.watermark = deckId;
