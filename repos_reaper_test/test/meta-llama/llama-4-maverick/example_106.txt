To resolve this merge conflict, we first need to understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The given code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a test class for the `AbstractAssert` class from the Fest Assertions library. The conflict arises from the import statements, specifically regarding the `org.junit` imports.

Let's analyze the conflict:

- The local version (`HEAD`) includes import statements for JUnit (`import org.junit.*;`), which suggests that the test class is using JUnit for its test framework.
- The incoming change (`06e86330876dee7fcb1356794176b04a7161cf65`) removes these JUnit import statements.

To resolve this conflict, we should consider the intent behind both changes. 

1. The local version (`HEAD`) is using JUnit for testing, as indicated by the import of JUnit classes. The presence of `org.fest.test.ExpectedException` also suggests that the test class might be using a custom or specific exception handling mechanism related to Fest Assertions, but JUnit's `ExpectedException` rule is commonly used for testing expected exceptions.

2. The removal of JUnit imports in the incoming change could imply one of a few things:
   - The test class is being refactored to not use JUnit directly (perhaps switching to another testing framework, or using a different approach that doesn't require direct JUnit imports).
   - The JUnit imports are not necessary or are being managed elsewhere (though this is less likely given the context).

However, without more context about the changes made in `06e86330876dee7fcb1356794176b04a7161cf65`, it's difficult to determine the exact intent. If the test class is still using JUnit annotations or rules (like `@Test`, `@Before`, `@Rule` for `ExpectedException`), removing the JUnit imports would break the compilation.

Given the information available and focusing on the semantic intent:

- If the test class still relies on JUnit (for annotations like `@Test`, or rules), removing the imports would be incorrect unless those usages are also being removed or refactored.
- If the incoming change implies a shift away from JUnit (or a significant refactoring that removes JUnit dependencies), and the local changes are not critical or can be adapted, one might lean towards accepting the removal of JUnit imports.

Since we cannot be certain about the intent behind the removal of JUnit imports without more context (like the rest of the test class or the changes in the commit `06e86330876dee7fcb1356794176b04a7161cf65`), and given that we should not modify the context or spacing, the safest resolution is to return the snippet as is, with the conflict, to avoid potentially introducing errors or misinterpreting the intent.
