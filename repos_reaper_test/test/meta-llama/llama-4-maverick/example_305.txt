To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of an Android activity, given the presence of `onResume()` and `onPause()` methods. These methods are lifecycle callbacks in Android activities.

The conflict is within the `onResume()` method. 

On the `HEAD` side (typically the local branch), the code calls `qrCodeReaderView.startCamera();` directly without any null check.

On the other side of the merge (`cb961dc3d5c704340d8ab747637d1c475bedc03d`, typically the branch being merged into the current branch), the code checks if `myDecoderView` is not null before calling `startCamera()` on it.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. The `HEAD` side is directly starting the camera on a `qrCodeReaderView`, suggesting that this view is expected to be initialized and ready for use. On the other side, there's a null check for `myDecoderView` before starting the camera, indicating a concern for avoiding a `NullPointerException` or acknowledging that `myDecoderView` might not be initialized at this point.

Notably, `qrCodeReaderView` and `myDecoderView` are different variables. The change on one side involves a different view than the other side. This could imply that one branch has renamed or replaced `qrCodeReaderView` with `myDecoderView`, or they serve related but distinct purposes.

To resolve this, we must consider the possibility that both changes are intended to achieve slightly different goals or are part of different refactorings. However, they are within the same method, suggesting they might be related.

If `qrCodeReaderView` and `myDecoderView` are meant to be the same or serve the same purpose, and one has been renamed or is being phased out, we should align the code accordingly. However, without more context on their relationship, the safest semantic resolution would be to ensure that the view (whichever is appropriate) is not null before attempting to start the camera.

Let's examine if there's a straightforward resolution:

1. If `myDecoderView` and `qrCodeReaderView` are the same or equivalent, and the change involves a renaming, we should use the version that is not null and is appropriately named.

2. If they are different and both necessary, both should be started if they are not null.

However, the snippet does not directly suggest that both views are necessary or that they are being used interchangeably. 

The code as is, does not provide enough context to conclusively determine the intent behind the use of `qrCodeReaderView` and `myDecoderView`, and whether one is a refactor of the other.

Given the information, a cautious resolution would be to ensure that the correct view is being used and that it's not null. But directly merging the changes as is, could result in either:

- Using `myDecoderView` and checking for null, potentially losing the functionality if `qrCodeReaderView` is the correct or still necessary view.
- Directly using `qrCodeReaderView` without a null check, potentially causing a `NullPointerException` if it's not initialized.

To preserve the intent and avoid potential `NullPointerException`, and without further context on whether `qrCodeReaderView` and `myDecoderView` are interchangeable or one is a replacement for the other, we can consider a resolution that checks for null before starting the camera.

However, the most straightforward resolution, given the direct conflict and assuming `myDecoderView` and `qrCodeReaderView` are related or one is a replacement for the other, is to directly return the snippet as the conflict resolution might depend on understanding which view is relevant.

Here is the snippet returned as is, in markdown code syntax:

```java
  }

  @Override protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();

<<<<<<< HEAD
    qrCodeReaderView.startCamera();
=======
    if (myDecoderView != null) {
      myDecoderView.startCamera();
    }
>>>>>>> cb961dc3d5c704340d8ab747637d1c475bedc03d
  }

  @Override protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();

```
