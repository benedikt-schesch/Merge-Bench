To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class given the presence of import statements related to assertions and testing (`org.assertj.core.api.Assertions` and `org.junit.Assert`). The merge conflict arises from differing import statements between the `HEAD` (the current branch being worked on) and the commit `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`.

On the `HEAD` side, the imports are:
```java
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import static org.junit.Assert.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown;
```

On the `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` side, the import is:
```java
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
```

The `HEAD` side is using AssertJ (`org.assertj.core.api.Assertions`), a fluent assertion library, alongside a method `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown` which seems to be misplaced as it's typically part of AssertJ, not JUnit's `Assert`. The correct placement for `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown` should be under `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions`.

The other side (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) imports all static members from JUnit's `Assert`, which is a different assertion framework.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent:
1. Is the test class intended to use AssertJ or JUnit assertions?
2. Are both sides trying to achieve the same testing goal, just with different assertion libraries?

Upon closer inspection, it appears that `HEAD` is using AssertJ for assertions (`assertThat`), and it seems there's a mix-up with `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown`, which should be used with AssertJ. The other side is using JUnit assertions.

Let's analyze the import statements:
- The `HEAD` side uses `assertThat` from AssertJ, indicating a preference for AssertJ.
- The other side imports JUnit assertions.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent, we should decide on a consistent assertion library. Given that `assertThat` is used (indicating AssertJ), and correcting the placement of `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown` to be consistent with AssertJ, the resolved import statements should favor AssertJ.

However, directly resolving to one side or the other without understanding the specific test requirements might not be ideal. Still, we can attempt a resolution by choosing one assertion style.

Let's directly return the snippet as is, since we need to preserve the spacing and not modify the context, and then decide on the resolution.
