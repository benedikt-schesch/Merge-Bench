To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a class that manages displaying toast messages or other UI-related functionality in an Android application. The left side of the merge (`HEAD`) defines a static array `mResourceMap` that maps to certain drawable resources. The right side of the merge (`d71053b45ade1149cf75bdd0e8b9259c9894dc60`) introduces a method `setToastResource` that allows setting a custom array of resource IDs for toast messages, indicating a more dynamic or configurable approach to managing toast resources.

Upon closer inspection, we notice that the `mResourceMap` on the left is not being used anywhere in the provided snippet, whereas the right side introduces `mToastResourcesMap` and uses it in the `maybeShowToast` method, which is also present in the original code before the conflict. It seems that both sides are working towards configuring or managing resources for toast messages but in different ways.

The left side defines a fixed, static mapping (`mResourceMap`), while the right side provides a method to dynamically set the resources (`setToastResource`) and uses `mToastResourcesMap` in `maybeShowToast`. The conflict arises because these changes are in close proximity in the code.

To resolve the conflict, we need to decide whether to prioritize the static definition of resources or the dynamic configuration of toast resources. Since `mResourceMap` is not used in the snippet and seems redundant with the introduction of `mToastResourcesMap` and its associated method, and considering that the dynamic approach provides more flexibility, we could lean towards the changes introduced by the right side of the merge.

However, to preserve the intent and ensure we don't break existing functionality (not fully visible in the snippet), we should ensure that either the static resource map is utilized or the dynamic configuration is properly integrated.

Here's the resolution, preserving the original spacing and context, and returning it in markdown code syntax:

```java
        intent.setClass(mActivity, cls);
        mActivity.startActivity(intent);

    }

    public void setToastResource(int[] resourceIds) {
        mToastEnabled = true;
        mToastResourcesMap = resourceIds;
    }

    private void maybeShowToast(int whichActicity) {
        if (mToastEnabled && whichActicity < mToastResourcesMap.length) {
            final Toast myToast = new Toast(mActivity);
            final ImageView myView = new ImageView(mActivity);
```
