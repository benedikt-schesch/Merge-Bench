To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a Java import section for an AndEngine-based Android application. The conflict arises from the addition of a new import statement.

```java
import org.andengine.entity.text.Text;
import org.andengine.entity.text.Text.TextOptions;
import org.andengine.entity.util.FPSLogger;
import org.andengine.opengl.font.Font;
import org.andengine.opengl.font.FontFactory;
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import org.andengine.opengl.vbo.VertexBufferObjectManager;
>>>>>>> e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885
import org.andengine.ui.activity.SimpleBaseGameActivity;
import org.andengine.util.HorizontalAlign;

import android.graphics.Typeface;
```

The conflict is between the `HEAD` version (the local version being merged) and the version from the commit `e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885`. The latter includes an additional import statement for `org.andengine.opengl.vbo.VertexBufferObjectManager`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions. The `HEAD` version does not include the import for `VertexBufferObjectManager`, suggesting that it might not be using this class directly or it's not necessary in the context of `HEAD`. On the other hand, the version from `e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885` includes this import, indicating that it likely uses `VertexBufferObjectManager` somewhere in the code.

Since the addition of the import statement in the other branch does not inherently conflict with the existing imports in `HEAD`, and assuming that the code change associated with this import is correctly handled elsewhere in the merge (i.e., the class is used appropriately), the merge conflict can be resolved by accepting the change from the other branch.

The resolution involves including the new import statement in the merged version because it does not conflict with any existing imports and is likely necessary for the functionality introduced in the other branch.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:
```java
import org.andengine.entity.text.Text;
import org.andengine.entity.text.Text.TextOptions;
import org.andengine.entity.util.FPSLogger;
import org.andengine.opengl.font.Font;
import org.andengine.opengl.font.FontFactory;
import org.andengine.opengl.vbo.VertexBufferObjectManager;
import org.andengine.ui.activity.SimpleBaseGameActivity;
import org.andengine.util.HorizontalAlign;

import android.graphics.Typeface;
