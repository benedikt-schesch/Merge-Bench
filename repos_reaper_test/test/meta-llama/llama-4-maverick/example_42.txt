The conflict is purely related to code formatting. Both sides of the merge are achieving the same functionality, and the difference lies in how the `throws` clause is formatted. The left-hand side has a line break after the comma, while the right-hand side does not. Since there's no semantic difference between the two, the conflict can be resolved by choosing one format. I've resolved it by keeping the more conventional single-line format for the `throws` clause as presented in the resolved code snippet.
