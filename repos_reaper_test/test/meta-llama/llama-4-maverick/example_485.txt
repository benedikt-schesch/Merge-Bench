To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides. The given code snippet is a Java import statement section from an Android application that utilizes the AndEngine library for game development.

The conflict arises from the addition of a new import statement. The `HEAD` version (typically the local or current branch) does not include the import for `org.andengine.opengl.vbo.VertexBufferObjectManager`, while the version from `e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885` (the other branch or the branch being merged) does include it.

To resolve this, we need to understand the intent behind adding `org.andengine.opengl.vbo.VertexBufferObjectManager`. This import is related to managing vertex buffer objects, which is a part of rendering graphics. If the changes in the other branch (`e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885`) involve using `VertexBufferObjectManager` somewhere in the code, then this import is necessary.

Given the information and without seeing the rest of the code changes in both branches, the most straightforward resolution is to include the import statement if it's used somewhere in the code. 

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
import org.andengine.input.touch.TouchEvent;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.region.ITextureRegion;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.region.TextureRegionFactory;
import org.andengine.opengl.texture.render.RenderTexture;
import org.andengine.opengl.util.GLState;
import org.andengine.opengl.vbo.VertexBufferObjectManager;
import org.andengine.ui.activity.SimpleBaseGameActivity;
import org.andengine.util.modifier.ease.EaseQuadInOut;

import android.widget.Toast;
```

This resolution assumes that the addition of `VertexBufferObjectManager` import is relevant and used within the code. If it's not used, it might be removed by an IDE or a code cleanup process, but based on the information provided, including it is the most semantically correct merge resolution.
