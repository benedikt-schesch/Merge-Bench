To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class or interface related to Apache Pig, a high-level data processing language and framework. The imports are crucial as they bring in necessary classes and interfaces from Java and Apache Pig.

The merge conflict revolves around the import statements. The local changes (`HEAD`) have added `java.io.OutputStream` and `java.io.PrintStream` to the imports. On the other hand, the incoming changes (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) have added `java.util.Collection` to the imports.

Let's examine the intent and semantics:

1. **Local Changes (`HEAD`):** The addition of `java.io.OutputStream` and `java.io.PrintStream` suggests that the local changes are likely related to writing or printing data to an output stream. This could be part of a feature or fix that involves outputting data in a specific format or to a particular destination.

2. **Incoming Changes (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`):** The addition of `java.util.Collection` indicates that the incoming changes might be utilizing methods or classes that operate on or return collections. This could be related to handling or manipulating data in the form of collections within the context of Apache Pig.

Given that both sets of changes add different import statements and there's no direct conflict in terms of the import statements being added (i.e., they are not trying to import different classes with the same name), the resolution involves including all the necessary import statements.

To resolve the conflict, we will include all the import statements from both sides. The resulting code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context, is as follows:

```java
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Collection;

import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.OperatorPlan;
import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.VisitorException;
import org.apache.pig.impl.plan.PlanException;
```
