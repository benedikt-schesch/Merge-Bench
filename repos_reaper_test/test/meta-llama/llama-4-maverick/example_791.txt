To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a class that handles channel connections in a networked application, specifically interacting with an HBase database. The method `channelConnected` is called when a channel is connected, and it is responsible for sending a header to the connected channel based on certain conditions.

The conflict arises around the determination of which header to send. Let's break down the changes:

1. **Local Changes (HEAD):** The local version checks if a specific system property (`org.hbase.async.cdh3b3`) is set. If it is, the `headerCDH3b3()` is used; otherwise, it defaults to `header090()`. This suggests a conditional logic based on the presence of this system property to determine the header.

2. **Incoming Changes (d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f):** The incoming changes introduce a new condition based on `hbase_client.has_root`. If `hbase_client.has_root` is false, it sends `header095()` and proceeds with `becomeReady(chan, SERVER_VERSION_095_OR_ABOVE)`, returning without calling `helloRpc(chan, header)`. If `hbase_client.has_root` is true, it then checks for the `org.hbase.async.cdh3b3` system property, similar to the local version but with an additional condition.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes:

- The local changes provide a way to use a specific header (`headerCDH3b3()`) when the `org.hbase.async.cdh3b3` system property is set, falling back to `header090()` otherwise.
- The incoming changes prioritize checking if `hbase_client.has_root` is false and, if so, use `header095()` and do not proceed with the rest of the method's original logic. If `hbase_client.has_root` is true, they then apply a similar logic to the local version regarding the `org.hbase.async.cdh3b3` system property.

Given the intent and the semantics, the resolved code should reflect a combination that respects both conditions. The incoming changes introduce a new condition that should be considered before the local changes' logic. Thus, the resolution involves integrating both conditions.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
  @Override
  public void channelConnected(final ChannelHandlerContext ctx,
                               final ChannelStateEvent e) {
    final Channel chan = e.getChannel();
    final ChannelBuffer header;
    if (!hbase_client.has_root) {
      header = header095();
      Channels.write(chan, header);
      becomeReady(chan, SERVER_VERSION_095_OR_ABOVE);
      return;
    } else if (System.getProperty("org.hbase.async.cdh3b3") != null) {
      header = headerCDH3b3();
    } else {
      header = header090();
    }
    helloRpc(chan, header);
```
