To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a Maven Android project configuration within an Eclipse environment. The method `configureClasspath` is used to configure the classpath for a Maven project facade. 

The conflict arises in the lines where an `EclipseAndroidProject` is being created. 

On the left side of the conflict (`HEAD`), the `EclipseAndroidProject` is created using an `eclipseProjectFactory`:
```java
final EclipseAndroidProject eclipseProject = eclipseProjectFactory.createAndroidProject(facade.getProject());
```

On the right side of the conflict (`4b0f0ad0ce6afc98a1fc78b9fe46584c41f478e8`), it is created by instantiating an `AdtEclipseAndroidProject` directly:
```java
final EclipseAndroidProject eclipseProject = new AdtEclipseAndroidProject(registry, facade.getProject(), classpath);
```

Both changes are attempting to create an instance of `EclipseAndroidProject`, but they are doing it in different ways and potentially with different parameters.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes.

1. The left side (`HEAD`) uses a factory method (`eclipseProjectFactory.createAndroidProject`) to create the `EclipseAndroidProject`. This could be beneficial for encapsulating the creation logic and potentially allowing for different implementations or configurations of `EclipseAndroidProject` in the future.

2. The right side (`4b0f0ad0ce6afc98a1fc78b9fe46584c41f478e8`) directly instantiates `AdtEclipseAndroidProject`, which is a specific type of `EclipseAndroidProject`, and passes additional parameters (`registry` and `classpath`) that are not present on the left side. This could imply that `AdtEclipseAndroidProject` requires these additional parameters for its configuration or that it offers some specific functionality related to `registry` and `classpath`.

Without more context about the specific requirements or changes intended by each side, a straightforward resolution isn't clear. However, we can try to infer a semantically correct merge.

If the intention is to leverage the benefits of both approaches (e.g., using a factory for instantiation while also passing the additional parameters required by `AdtEclipseAndroidProject`), one potential resolution could involve modifying the factory method to accommodate the creation of `AdtEclipseAndroidProject` with the necessary parameters.

However, since the exact intent and the relationship between `EclipseAndroidProject` and `AdtEclipseAndroidProject` aren't clear from the provided snippet, and without knowing how `registry` is defined or used (as it's not present on the left side), a safe resolution isn't directly apparent.

Therefore, given the ambiguity and the potential for altering the intended functionality, the best course of action is to return the original snippet with the conflict, as modifying it without clear understanding could introduce errors.

Here is the snippet in markdown code syntax as requested, unchanged:
