To resolve the merge conflict, let's first analyze the given code snippet and understand the changes made on both sides of the merge.


The conflict arises in the `onLoadResources()` method where the initialization of `this.mFontTexture` differs between the two merging branches.

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTexture(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
=======
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
```


On one side (`HEAD`), `this.mFontTexture` is being initialized as a `BitmapTexture`. On the other side (`91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d`), it's being initialized as a `BitmapTextureAtlas`.

To resolve this, we need to understand the semantic intent behind both changes. `BitmapTexture` and `BitmapTextureAtlas` serve different purposes, although they might seem similar at first glance. A `BitmapTexture` is used for a single bitmap, whereas a `BitmapTextureAtlas` is used to manage multiple bitmaps within a single texture atlas.


Given the context where `this.mFont` is created using `this.mFontTexture` and then both the texture and font are loaded into the engine's texture and font managers, respectively, we need to determine which class is appropriate for `this.mFontTexture`.

The class `Font` is being initialized with `this.mFontTexture`, suggesting that `this.mFontTexture` is expected to be a texture that can be used by the font rendering system.


Upon closer inspection, it appears that `BitmapTextureAtlas` is likely the correct choice because it's a more specific and potentially more efficient class for managing textures, especially in the context of AndEngine (a popular Android game engine), where texture atlases are commonly used to optimize rendering.


Therefore, considering the intent and the context provided, the resolution should favor `BitmapTextureAtlas` over `BitmapTexture` for `this.mFontTexture`, assuming that the code change represented by `91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d` is correct and aligns with the intended functionality.


The resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, without modifying the context and preserving the original spacing, is as follows:

```java
		return new Engine(new EngineOptions(true, ScreenOrientation.LANDSCAPE, new RatioResolutionPolicy(CAMERA_WIDTH, CAMERA_HEIGHT), this.mCamera));
	}

	@Override
	public void onLoadResources() {
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);

		this.mFont = new Font(this.mFontTexture, Typeface.create(Typeface.DEFAULT, Typeface.BOLD), 22, true, Color.WHITE);

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mFontTexture);
		this.mEngine.getFontManager().loadFont(this.mFont);
```
