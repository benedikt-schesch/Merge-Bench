To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles graphical or game-related functionality, given the presence of `Camera`, `Scene`, `BitmapTexture`, `TextureRegion`, and `MenuScene`. The conflict revolves around the declaration of a texture-related variable.

On one side of the merge (`HEAD`), we have `private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;`. This suggests that the code is using a `BitmapTexture` object, which is likely used to represent a texture derived from a bitmap.

On the other side of the merge (`91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d`), the declaration is `private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;`. This indicates the use of a `BitmapTextureAtlas`, which is typically used to manage multiple smaller textures within a single larger texture (atlas), optimizing rendering by reducing the number of texture swaps.

The presence of `private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;` on both sides (since it's below the conflict markers and not within them) suggests that the code intends to use a region of a texture, likely for rendering a face or an image. `TextureRegion` is often used in conjunction with a texture atlas to identify a specific area within the atlas.

Considering the intent and semantics:
- The `HEAD` version uses a `BitmapTexture`, which could be directly used if the requirement is to render a single bitmap or texture without the need for an atlas.
- The other version (`91801fdd`) uses a `BitmapTextureAtlas`, which is more versatile and efficient for managing multiple textures. Given that `mFaceTextureRegion` is used alongside it (and is present on both sides), it suggests an intent to use a texture atlas and extract regions from it for rendering.

Since `mFaceTextureRegion` implies the use of a texture atlas (as `TextureRegion` is typically associated with an atlas), the version with `BitmapTextureAtlas` aligns more closely with the subsequent use of `mFaceTextureRegion`. 

However, resolving the conflict isn't straightforward without understanding the broader context or the specific requirements of the code (e.g., whether it's intended to manage a single texture or multiple textures). 

Given the information and focusing on preserving the intent and semantics, the most straightforward resolution would be to choose the version that aligns with the use of `TextureRegion`, which suggests an atlas is being used.

But, to follow the instructions precisely and given the potential ambiguity in resolving the conflict without more context, the task requires returning the snippet as is, with the conflict markers.
