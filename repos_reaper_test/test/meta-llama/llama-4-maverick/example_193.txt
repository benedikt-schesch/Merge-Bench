To resolve this merge conflict, I will first analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a method that instantiates an object using reflection. The method attempts to find a constructor for the object class (`objClass`) and invoke it with the provided arguments (`args`).

The conflict arises when trying to invoke a constructor with a variable number of arguments (`var arg constructor`). Both sides of the merge are trying to achieve the same goal: to create an array of objects (`wrappedArgs`) that contains the arguments to be passed to the constructor.

The difference lies in how the `args` are being processed before being wrapped in `wrappedArgs`. 

On the left side (`HEAD`), `args` is converted to an array of strings (`argArr`) using `args.toArray(new String[0])`, and then `argArr` is assigned to `wrappedArgs[0]`.

On the right side (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`), `args` is directly assigned to `wrappedArgs[0]`.

To understand the intent, let's examine the types involved. The constructor being invoked is expected to take a `String[]` as its parameter (since it's `getConstructor(String[].class)`), and it is being wrapped in an `Object[]` to be passed as a vararg argument.

The type of `args` isn't explicitly shown in this snippet, but based on the operations performed on it, we can infer its likely type. On the left side, `args.toArray(new String[0])` suggests that `args` is a collection of strings (likely a `List<String>`), which is being converted into a `String[]`. On the right side, `args` is directly being assigned to an `Object[]`, implying it could already be an array or is being treated as such.

The resolution depends on understanding what `args` is. If `args` is a `List<String>`, then the left side makes sense as it converts the list to a `String[]`. If `args` is already a `String[]`, then the right side's approach is more straightforward and efficient.

Given that both approaches seem plausible and without knowing the exact type and intent behind `args`, the safest resolution would be to examine the type of `args` and the surrounding context more closely.

However, since the task requires returning the entire snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context, and given that the conflict isn't straightforward to resolve without additional context, I will return the snippet as is.

```java
        }
        catch(NoSuchMethodException nme) {
            // Second channce. Try with var arg constructor
            try {
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(String[].class);
<<<<<<< HEAD
                String[] argArr = args.toArray(new String[0]) ;
                Object[] wrappedArgs = new Object[1] ;
                wrappedArgs[0] = argArr ;
=======
                Object[] wrappedArgs = new Object[1] ;
                wrappedArgs[0] = args ;

                ret =  c.newInstance(wrappedArgs);
            }
            catch(Throwable e){
                // bad luck
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
