To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of the Apache Pig project, specifically within the `org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.math` package. The class or method being defined here seems to be related to a user-defined function (UDF) for Pig, given the import of `EvalFunc` and other Pig-related classes.

The merge conflict arises from the removal of `import org.apache.pig.data.DataAtom;` in the commit represented by `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`. 

Let's examine the imports and their relevance:

1. `import java.io.IOException;` - This is a standard Java import for handling input/output exceptions.
2. `import org.apache.pig.EvalFunc;` - This is crucial for defining a Pig UDF.
3. `import org.apache.pig.data.DataAtom;` - This import is being removed in one of the commits. `DataAtom` is not a standard class in the current Apache Pig API; however, it's known that older versions of Pig used `DataAtom`. It has been largely replaced by more specific data types and `Tuple`/`DataBag` for complex data structures.
4. `import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;` - This is relevant for handling tuple data types in Pig, which is a fundamental data structure.
5. `import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.schema.Schema;` - This is necessary for schema-related operations in Pig.
6. `import org.apache.pig.data.DataType;` - This import is used for referencing Pig's data types.

The conflict here is essentially about whether to keep or remove the `DataAtom` import. 

To resolve the conflict, we need to determine if `DataAtom` is still used within the class. If it's not used, and given that it's not a standard part of the current Pig API, it's likely safe to remove it, aligning with the change in `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`. However, without seeing the class's implementation (the code that follows the imports), we can't be certain if `DataAtom` is being used.

Given the information available and focusing on the intent and semantics:

```java
package org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.math;

import java.io.IOException;

import org.apache.pig.EvalFunc;
import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.schema.Schema;
import org.apache.pig.data.DataType;

```

is the result of removing the conflict, by choosing the side that removes `DataAtom`. However, I will return the original snippet with conflict as per the task instructions and because we cannot be certain of the usage of `DataAtom` within the class.

```java
package org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.math;

import java.io.IOException;

import org.apache.pig.EvalFunc;
