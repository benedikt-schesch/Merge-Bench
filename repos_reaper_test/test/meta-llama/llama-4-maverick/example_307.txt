To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a part of a Java application, specifically a method named `createAndShowGUI` which is used to set the look and feel of the application's GUI to the system's default and then create an instance of `FlingFrame`.

The conflict arises in the `try-catch` block where the exception handling is concerned. The code on the left side of the conflict (denoted by `<<<<<<< HEAD`) catches an `Exception` with the syntax `catch (Exception ex)`, while the code on the right side (denoted by `>>>>>>> a4124a4ad635d102c78fcfce196713a40477586f`) uses `catch(Exception ex)`.

The difference between these two is merely in the spacing between `catch` and `(Exception ex)`. In Java, this spacing does not affect the semantics of the code. Both versions are syntactically correct and functionally equivalent.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both changes. Since the difference is only in formatting (spacing), and there's no actual semantic difference, we can choose either version without affecting the functionality of the code.

Let's analyze the surrounding context and the changes:

1. The rest of the code snippet remains unchanged on both sides of the merge, indicating that the conflict is isolated to the `catch` statement formatting.
2. Both sides of the conflict are catching the same exception type (`Exception`) and handling it in the same way.

Given that the difference is stylistic and not semantic, and without additional context that might suggest a preference for one style over the other in the project, the conflict can be resolved by choosing one of the versions.

Let's return the entire snippet with the conflict resolved by picking the standard formatting convention commonly used in Java, which is `catch (Exception ex)`:

```java
	 */
	public static void createAndShowGUI() {
		Log.d(LOG_TAG, "set to system default LaF");
		try {
			UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
		} catch (Exception ex) {
			System.out.println("Cannot find system look and feel, setting to metal.");
		}
		Log.d(LOG_TAG, "createAndShowGUI");
		flingFrame = new FlingFrame();
		// change the default app icon; might not work for all platforms

```
