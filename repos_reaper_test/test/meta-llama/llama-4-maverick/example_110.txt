To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Conflict**: The conflict is in the import statements of a Java file. The two versions of the code being merged have different import statements for classes from the `org.fest.test` package.

2. **Analyzing the Changes**:
   - The version from `HEAD` (the current branch) imports `org.fest.test.Employee` and `org.fest.test.Name` explicitly.
   - The version from `06e86330876dee7fcb1356794176b04a7161cf65` (the branch being merged) imports all classes from `org.fest.test` using a wildcard (`*`).

3. **Intent and Semantics**:
   - The intent behind the explicit imports in `HEAD` might be to use `Employee` and `Name` classes specifically. However, there could be other classes used elsewhere in the file that are not shown in the snippet.
   - The intent behind the wildcard import in the other branch is to import all classes (or possibly multiple specific classes not shown) from `org.fest.test`, potentially simplifying the import section or preparing for the use of additional classes from the same package.

4. **Resolving the Conflict**:
   - To resolve the conflict, we need to consider what classes are being used in the file. If only `Employee` and `Name` are used, the explicit imports might be preferred for clarity and to avoid importing unnecessary classes.
   - If there are or will be other classes used from `org.fest.test`, the wildcard import could be more convenient.

5. **Given Information**: The provided snippet does not show the usage of any other classes from `org.fest.test` beyond `Employee` and `Name`. However, without seeing the rest of the file, we can't be certain about the usage.

6. **Resolution Approach**: Since the conflict is just in the import statements and not in the code logic, and we are instructed not to modify the context or spacing, we can directly examine the import statements.

Given that we are to preserve the spacing and context as is and the snippet does not provide enough information to conclusively determine the best resolution based on the usage of classes from `org.fest.test`, the most straightforward resolution that doesn't alter the semantics or intent significantly would be to choose one form of import that could encompass both changes.

However, since we're not allowed to modify the context and are to return the snippet as is if unsure, let's directly proceed to the resolution.
