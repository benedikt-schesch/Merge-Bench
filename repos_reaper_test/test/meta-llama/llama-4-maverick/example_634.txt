To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a larger class or interface that deals with Facebook's Graph API, given the reference to "http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user". The snippet includes a merge conflict marked by Git.

The conflict is between the local (`HEAD`) version and the version from the commit `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`. 

On the `HEAD` side, there is no additional code or comment related to the conflict area.

On the `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` side, a new static class `Picture` is introduced, extending `ProfilePictureSource`. This class is annotated with a TODO comment indicating that it should be removed upon type refactoring.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions.

1. The `HEAD` version does not include the `Picture` class, suggesting that either this class was not needed or it was removed or not yet added in this branch.

2. The `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` version includes the `Picture` class with a TODO comment. This indicates that the class was either added or is being kept temporarily until some refactoring is done regarding types.

Given the information and the TODO comment, it seems that the `Picture` class is a temporary or transitional element awaiting refactoring. If the refactoring has not been done and the class is still necessary for the functionality, it should be kept. If the refactoring has been completed and this class is no longer needed, it should be removed.

Without more context about whether the refactoring has been completed or the current necessity of the `Picture` class, the safest resolution that doesn't assume additional information is to include the `Picture` class as it is, since it represents a deliberate change with a clear intent (even if temporary).

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
    }

  }

  /**
   * @TODO remove this on type refactoring
   */
  public static class Picture extends ProfilePictureSource {
    // nothing here
  }

  /**
