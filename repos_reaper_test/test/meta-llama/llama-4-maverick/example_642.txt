To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a part of a Java class in the `com.restfb` package, and it involves JUnit tests. The conflict arises from the import statements where two different sets of static imports are being merged.

The left-hand side (HEAD) imports `assertThat` from `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions`, suggesting the use of AssertJ, a library that provides a fluent API for assertions in tests.

The right-hand side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe) imports `assertEquals` and `assertNotNull` from `org.junit.Assert`, indicating the use of JUnit's built-in assertion methods.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes on both sides. The left-hand side seems to be using AssertJ for assertions, as indicated by the import of `assertThat`. The right-hand side is using JUnit's assertion methods (`assertEquals` and `assertNotNull`).

Without seeing the actual test code that follows these import statements, the resolution involves considering whether both sets of assertions are needed. 

If the test class is using both AssertJ and JUnit assertions, then we should import both. However, it's generally good practice to stick to one assertion API in a test class to keep the code consistent and readable.

Let's assume that both sides have valid reasons for their respective changes and that the test methods might be using both AssertJ and JUnit assertions.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
 * THE SOFTWARE.
 */
package com.restfb;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;

import org.junit.Test;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
```

This resolution includes all import statements from both sides, allowing the test class to use both AssertJ and JUnit assertions. If the actual test code doesn't use both types of assertions, the unused imports could be removed to declutter the code. However, based on the given information, the above resolution preserves the intent of both sides of the merge.
