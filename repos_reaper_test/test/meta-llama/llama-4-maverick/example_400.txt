To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a test class setup for a plugin or module related to IntelliJ IDEA, given the presence of classes like `ProjectFileIndex`, `ProjectRootManager`, and `ModuleRootManager`. The class is preparing for tests by setting up various components related to the IntelliJ environment and a custom component or plugin referred to as "Infinitest".

The merge conflict arises from changes made to the fields declared within the class. 

- The local changes (`HEAD`) have introduced a `ModuleRootManager` field.
- The incoming changes (`3c868cbe67875b5515d13bd8b8237e13dd2f9c32`) have introduced two fields: `ModuleSettings` and `RuntimeEnvironment`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both sets of changes.

1. **Understanding `ModuleRootManager`**: This class is part of the IntelliJ IDEA API, used for managing the roots of a module. It could be used to access or manipulate the structure of a module within a project.

2. **Understanding `ModuleSettings` and `RuntimeEnvironment`**: `ModuleSettings` could be related to configuration or preferences specific to a module, potentially part of the "Infinitest" plugin or module. `RuntimeEnvironment` might be related to the environment in which the tests or the plugin operate.

Given the information and focusing on the intent and semantics:

- `ModuleRootManager` is used for managing module roots, which is a specific, well-defined task related to IntelliJ's module management.
- `ModuleSettings` and `RuntimeEnvironment` seem to be related to the configuration or operational context of the "Infinitest" plugin or module.

Both changes seem to be adding different but potentially complementary functionality. `ModuleRootManager` is closely related to the IntelliJ IDEA API for module management, while `ModuleSettings` and `RuntimeEnvironment` seem more related to the specific requirements or configurations of the "Infinitest" plugin.

Since there's no clear indication that one set of changes is redundant or conflicting in intent with the other (beyond the literal merge conflict), and assuming both are necessary for the broader functionality of the class or its tests, the resolution could involve including all three fields.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

	protected ModuleSettings moduleSettings;
	protected RuntimeEnvironment runtimeEnvironment;
	protected ProjectTestControl control;
	protected InfinitestAnnotator annotator;
	
	@BeforeEach
