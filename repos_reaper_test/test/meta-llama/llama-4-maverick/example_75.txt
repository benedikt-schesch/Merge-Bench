To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class constructor or a method where various dependencies are being injected. The conflict arises between two commits (or branches) where different variables are being assigned.

On one side (`HEAD`), the code is assigning `customDecksServiceProvider` to `this.customDecksServiceProvider`. This suggests that the class has a dependency on a service that handles custom decks, possibly in a card game context.

On the other side (`5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a`), the code is assigning `cardcastServiceProvider` to `this.cardcastServiceProvider`. This implies a dependency on a service related to Cardcast, which is a platform for creating and sharing custom card decks, often used with games like Cards Against Humanity.

Both assignments are to different fields (`customDecksServiceProvider` vs `cardcastServiceProvider`), indicating that they serve distinct purposes within the class. 

The intent behind both changes seems to be adding different service providers to the class, likely to enhance its functionality by integrating with different services.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider whether both services are required by the class. Given that they are different and likely serve different purposes, it's reasonable to assume that both are necessary.

Here's how we can resolve the conflict by including both assignments:

```java
    this.options = gameOptionsProvider.get();
    this.connectedUsers = connectedUsers;
    this.gameManager = gameManager;
    this.globalTimer = globalTimer;
    this.sessionProvider = sessionProvider;
    this.customDecksServiceProvider = customDecksServiceProvider;
    this.cardcastServiceProvider = cardcastServiceProvider;
    this.uniqueIdProvider = uniqueIdProvider;
    this.metrics = metrics;
    this.showRoundLinkProvider = showRoundLinkProvider;
    this.roundPermalinkFormatProvider = roundPermalinkFormatProvider;
    this.showGameLinkProvider = showGameLinkProvider;
```

The resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing, is:
```java
    this.options = gameOptionsProvider.get();
    this.connectedUsers = connectedUsers;
    this.gameManager = gameManager;
    this.globalTimer = globalTimer;
    this.sessionProvider = sessionProvider;
    this.customDecksServiceProvider = customDecksServiceProvider;
    this.cardcastServiceProvider = cardcastServiceProvider;
    this.uniqueIdProvider = uniqueIdProvider;
    this.metrics = metrics;
    this.showRoundLinkProvider = showRoundLinkProvider;
    this.roundPermalinkFormatProvider = roundPermalinkFormatProvider;
    this.showGameLinkProvider = showGameLinkProvider;
```
