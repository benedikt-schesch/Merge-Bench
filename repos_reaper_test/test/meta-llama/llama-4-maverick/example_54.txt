To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the intent of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a larger system managing a game, possibly a Cards Against Humanity-like game given the references to "card sets" and "Cardcast." The conflict arises in the logging statement where information about the game being started is recorded.

The conflict is between two versions of a line of code within a `String.format()` method used for logging. The versions differ in the variable used to represent "Cardcast" deck IDs.

1. The version from `HEAD` (the local repository) uses `customDecksIds`.
2. The version from the other branch (`5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a`) uses `cardcastDeckIds`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. 

- `customDecksIds` is used in the local version (`HEAD`), suggesting that it represents some form of custom or Cardcast deck identifiers.
- `cardcastDeckIds` is used in the other branch, explicitly indicating it represents Cardcast deck IDs.

Given the naming conventions, both `customDecksIds` and `cardcastDeckIds` seem to refer to Cardcast deck IDs, with `cardcastDeckIds` being more explicit. The question is whether they represent the same data or if there's a subtle difference in their intent or content.

Without additional context about how `customDecksIds` and `cardcastDeckIds` are defined, used, or modified elsewhere in the codebase, the most straightforward resolution is to choose the version that is more explicit or to consider if both changes are necessary.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that both variables are likely intended to represent Cardcast deck IDs. `customDecksIds` might have been an earlier or different naming convention for the same concept.

To resolve the conflict in a semantically correct manner, we should consider the following:

1. If `customDecksIds` and `cardcastDeckIds` are essentially representing the same data (Cardcast deck IDs), and there's no other context suggesting otherwise, we can choose one to keep. The more descriptive variable name `cardcastDeckIds` is preferable for clarity.

2. If there's a possibility that both variables have different origins or meanings within the code (which isn't immediately clear from the given snippet), we might need to preserve both or understand the context better.

Since `cardcastDeckIds` is more descriptive and directly indicates its relation to Cardcast decks, and without further context suggesting a need to retain `customDecksIds`, we can lean towards using `cardcastDeckIds` for clarity.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
      } else {
        started = false;
      }
      if (started) {
        currentUniqueId = uniqueIdProvider.get();
        logger.info(String.format("Starting game %d with card sets %s, Cardcast %s, %d blanks, %d " + "max players, %d max spectators, %d score limit, players %s, unique %s.", id, options.cardSetIds, cardcastDeckIds, options.blanksInDeck, options.playerLimit, options.spectatorLimit, options.scoreGoal, players, currentUniqueId));
        // do this stuff outside the players lock; they will lock players again later for much less
        // time, and not at the same time as trying to lock users, which has caused deadlocks
        final List<CardSet> cardSets;
        synchronized (options.cardSetIds) {
          cardSets = loadCardSets(session);
```
