To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that is responsible for building a logical plan, presumably for a query execution engine, given the presence of `LogicalPlanBuilder` and `PigContext`. The method `buildPlan(String query, ClassLoader cldr)` is where the conflict occurs.

On the left side of the conflict (`HEAD`), we have:
```java
PigContext pigContext = new PigContext(ExecType.LOCAL, new Properties());
```
This line creates a new `PigContext` with the execution type set to `LOCAL` and an empty set of properties.

On the right side of the conflict (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`), there is no code, indicating that this line has been removed or was never present.

The `LogicalPlanBuilder` is initialized with the `pigContext`:
```java
LogicalPlanBuilder builder = new LogicalPlanBuilder(pigContext);
```
For the code to work correctly, `pigContext` must be initialized before it's passed to `LogicalPlanBuilder`.

Given this context, the intent of the left side (`HEAD`) is to ensure that `pigContext` is properly initialized before being used. The right side (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) seems to be removing this initialization, which could imply that `pigContext` is either not needed or is being initialized elsewhere.

However, based on the provided snippet, removing the initialization of `pigContext` would result in a compilation error because `pigContext` is used in the next line. Therefore, it's likely that the removal of `PigContext` initialization on the right side is not a standalone change but part of a larger refactor that might initialize `pigContext` differently or ensure it's not needed.

Since we can't see the full context or the changes that accompany the removal of `PigContext` initialization on the right side, and given that simply removing the initialization would cause a compilation issue, the safest resolution based on the provided snippet is to keep the initialization of `pigContext` as it is on the left side (`HEAD`), ensuring that `LogicalPlanBuilder` receives a properly initialized `PigContext`.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
        return buildPlan(query, LogicalPlanBuilder.class.getClassLoader());
    }

    public LogicalPlan buildPlan(String query, ClassLoader cldr) {
        LogicalPlanBuilder.classloader = cldr;
        PigContext pigContext = new PigContext(ExecType.LOCAL, new Properties());
        LogicalPlanBuilder builder = new LogicalPlanBuilder(pigContext); //

        try {
            LogicalPlan lp = builder.parse("Test-Plan-Builder",
                                           query,
```
