To resolve the merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

On the left-hand side (HEAD), the code is using `BitmapTexture` and `BitmapTextureRegionFactory` to load a texture based on the state of `mToggleBox`. The asset is loaded from a file named either "face_box_tiled.png" or "face_circle_tiled.png".

On the right-hand side (91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d), the code is using `BitmapTextureAtlas` and `BitmapTextureAtlasTextureRegionFactory` to load a texture based on the state of `mToggleBox`. The asset is loaded from a file named either "gfx/face_box_tiled.png" or "gfx/face_circle_tiled.png". The main differences here are:
1. The use of `BitmapTextureAtlas` instead of `BitmapTexture`.
2. The use of `BitmapTextureAtlasTextureRegionFactory` instead of `BitmapTextureRegionFactory`.
3. The asset files are loaded from a "gfx/" directory.

The intent on both sides seems to be to toggle between two textures ("face_box_tiled.png" and "face_circle_tiled.png") based on the `mToggleBox` state. The changes on the right-hand side appear to be related to refactoring or updating the texture handling to use an atlas, which is a common optimization in graphics rendering.

To resolve the conflict, we need to determine if the changes on the right-hand side are intended to replace the logic on the left-hand side entirely or if there's a way to integrate both intents.

Given that the right-hand side changes involve a different class (`BitmapTextureAtlas` instead of `BitmapTexture`) and a different factory (`BitmapTextureAtlasTextureRegionFactory`), and considering that these changes might be part of a larger refactoring effort, it seems reasonable to adopt the right-hand side changes entirely if they are consistent with the overall project direction.

Therefore, the resolved code snippet, preserving the original context and spacing, and returned in markdown code syntax, is:

```java
	// ===========================================================
	// Methods
	// ===========================================================

	private void toggle() {
		this.mBitmapTextureAtlas.clearTextureAtlasSources();
		this.mToggleBox = !this.mToggleBox;
		BitmapTextureAtlasTextureRegionFactory.createTiledFromAsset(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, this, this.mToggleBox ? "gfx/face_box_tiled.png" : "gfx/face_circle_tiled.png", 0, 0, 2, 1);
	}
