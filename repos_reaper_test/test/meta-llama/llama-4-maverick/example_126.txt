To resolve the merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet and understand the intent of both sides of the merge.

The code is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles a commit response, likely in the context of a Git repository. The method `onResponse` is overridden, suggesting it's part of an interface or abstract class implementation.

The conflict arises in the line where `commitMessageTextView` is being set with text. The conflicting lines are:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.commit.message));
=======
commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.message));
>>>>>>> c120f1dfe1a968fce9fb82f405228d0fe13fe71c
```

Let's break down the intent and semantics:
1. **Left Side (HEAD):** `commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.commit.message));` suggests that the commit object has a nested `commit` object, which in turn has a `message` property. This is accessing the commit message through `commit.commit.message`.

2. **Right Side (c120f1dfe1a968fce9fb82f405228d0fe13fe71c):** `commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.message));` implies that the commit message is directly accessible through `commit.message`, without the need for an intermediate `commit` object.

To resolve this, we need to understand the structure of the `Commit` object. 

- If `Commit` has a nested structure like `commit.commit.message`, the left side is correct.
- If `Commit` directly contains the `message`, the right side is correct.

Without additional context about the `Commit` class structure, it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict. However, considering common practices in Git APIs and commit representations, both representations could be valid depending on the specific API or library being used.

For instance, in GitHub APIs, a commit object often contains a nested `commit` object that holds details like the commit message, while the outer commit object might directly contain other information like the author or committer.

Given the information available and focusing on preserving the original context and spacing, the conflict resolution should ideally be based on understanding the `Commit` object's structure.

Since we don't have explicit details on the `Commit` class, let's directly examine the conflicting changes.

To resolve this conflict, if we assume that both representations could be potentially correct based on the API or library being used, we should look for a way that could satisfy both intents or choose one based on the most likely correct interpretation.

However, the task requires returning the snippet with the conflict if the intent is ambiguous. Given that we are dealing with a potential difference in how the `Commit` object is structured or accessed, and without further information on the `Commit` class, the intent could be considered ambiguous.

Thus, the resolution, in this case, would be to return the original snippet as is, with the conflict markers.

```java

  @Override
  public void onResponse(Commit commit, boolean firstTime) {

    if (commit.commit != null && commit.commit.message != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.commit.message));
=======
      commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.message));
>>>>>>> c120f1dfe1a968fce9fb82f405228d0fe13fe71c
    }

    User author = commit.author;

    if (author != null) {
```
