```java

  private void skipIdlePlayers() {
    killRoundTimer();
    final List<User> playersToRemove = new ArrayList<>();
    final List<Player> playersToUpdateStatus = new ArrayList<>();
    synchronized (roundPlayers) {

      for (final Player player : roundPlayers) {
        final List<WhiteCard> cards = playedCards.getCards(player);
        if (cards == null || cards.size() < blackCard.getPick()) {

The conflict is between using the raw type `new ArrayList()` versus the diamond operator `new ArrayList<>()`. Both sides are trying to initialize empty lists, but the side with `HEAD` is using the older Java syntax, while the other side is using the more modern diamond operator, which is a shorthand for the same thing and is generally considered better practice as it reduces verbosity and improves readability. Since the intent is the same on both sides, I resolved the conflict by keeping the more modern syntax.
