To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that extends or implements certain functionality related to graphics or game development, given the presence of terms like `Engine`, `EngineOptions`, `ScreenOrientation`, `BitmapTexture`, `BitmapTextureAtlas`, and `Font`. The conflict arises in the `onLoadResources` method.

### Understanding the Conflict

The conflict is between two versions of the code within the `onLoadResources` method:

- The version from `HEAD` (the local branch being merged) uses `BitmapTexture` for `mFontTexture`, `mStrokeFontTexture`, and `mStrokeOnlyFontTexture`.
- The version being merged (`91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d`) uses `BitmapTextureAtlas` for the same variables.

### Resolving the Conflict

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the semantic differences between `BitmapTexture` and `BitmapTextureAtlas`.

- `BitmapTexture` typically represents a texture that is used directly, possibly implying a simpler or more straightforward texture management.
- `BitmapTextureAtlas` suggests a texture atlas, which is a larger texture that contains multiple smaller textures. Using a texture atlas can improve performance by reducing the number of texture switches during rendering.

Given the names `mFontTexture`, `mStrokeFontTexture`, and `mStrokeOnlyFontTexture`, and their usage with `Font` and `StrokeFont` classes, it seems that these textures are related to font rendering. The change from `BitmapTexture` to `BitmapTextureAtlas` might be intended to manage font textures more efficiently, possibly allowing for better batching or fewer texture changes during rendering.

However, without more context about the specific requirements or changes intended by the merge, we must carefully consider the intent behind both versions.

### Decision

Since `BitmapTextureAtlas` is generally used for managing multiple textures within a single larger texture (which can be beneficial for performance), and assuming that the merge is updating the code to use a more efficient or modern texture management approach, we could lean towards using `BitmapTextureAtlas`. However, we need to ensure that this change is compatible with the rest of the codebase and does not introduce any regressions.

### Resolution

```java
	return new Engine(new EngineOptions(true, ScreenOrientation.LANDSCAPE, new RatioResolutionPolicy(CAMERA_WIDTH, CAMERA_HEIGHT), this.mCamera));
}

@Override
public void onLoadResources() {
	this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
	this.mStrokeFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
	this.mStrokeOnlyFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);

	this.mFont = new Font(this.mFontTexture, Typeface.create(Typeface.DEFAULT, Typeface.BOLD), FONT_SIZE, true, Color.BLACK);
	this.mStrokeFont = new StrokeFont(this.mStrokeFontTexture, Typeface.create(Typeface.DEFAULT, Typeface.BOLD), FONT_SIZE, true, Color.BLACK, 2, Color.WHITE);
	this.mStrokeOnlyFont = new StrokeFont(this.mStrokeOnlyFontTexture, Typeface.create(Typeface.DEFAULT, Typeface.BOLD), FONT_SIZE, true, Color.BLACK, 2, Color.WHITE, true);
