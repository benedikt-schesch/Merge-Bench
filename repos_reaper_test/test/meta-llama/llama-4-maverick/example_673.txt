To resolve this merge conflict, let's first analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles account provider parameters. The constructor `AccountProviderParameters` is being modified.

On the left-hand side (HEAD), the constructor has the following parameters:
- `name`
- `displayName`
- `apiKey`
- `secret`
- `appId`
- `requestTokenUrl`
- `authorizeUrl`
- `callbackUrl`
- `accessTokenUrl`

On the right-hand side (228af53d8db4ea1b58282f203bd404a3d011b7a8), the constructor has the following parameters:
- `name`
- `apiKey`
- `secret`
- `appId`
- `requestTokenUrl`
- `authorizeUrl`
- `accessTokenUrl`

Notice that `displayName` and `callbackUrl` are present in the HEAD version but missing in the other version. 

Let's examine how the parameters are used within the constructor:
- Both versions assign `name`, `apiKey`, `secret`, and `appId` to their respective instance variables.
- The HEAD version also assigns `displayName` to an instance variable, which is not present in the other version.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes on both sides. The right-hand side seems to have removed `displayName` and `callbackUrl` from the constructor parameters. If we look closely, the `displayName` is being used in the constructor on the left-hand side (`this.displayName = displayName;`), suggesting it's an important field. The `callbackUrl` is not being used within the provided snippet, but its presence or absence could be significant depending on the larger context.

Since `displayName` is used and presumably important, and there's no indication within the given context that it's no longer needed, we should preserve it. The absence of `callbackUrl` in the right-hand side and its not being used in the given snippet suggests it might have been intentionally removed, possibly because it's not necessary or is being handled differently elsewhere.

Let's combine the changes, ensuring that we don't lose important information or functionality.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
	
	private final UriTemplate authorizeUrl;
	
	private final String accessTokenUrl;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	public AccountProviderParameters(String name, String displayName, String apiKey, String secret, Long appId,
			String requestTokenUrl, String authorizeUrl, String callbackUrl, String accessTokenUrl) {
=======
	public AccountProviderParameters(String name, String apiKey, String secret, Long appId, String requestTokenUrl, String authorizeUrl, String accessTokenUrl) {
>>>>>>> 228af53d8db4ea1b58282f203bd404a3d011b7a8
		this.name = name;
		this.displayName = displayName;
		this.apiKey = apiKey;
		this.secret = secret;
		this.appId = appId;
```

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that directly merging these changes isn't straightforward due to the differences in the constructor's parameter list.

The left-hand side includes `displayName` and `callbackUrl`, while the right-hand side does not. To merge them semantically, we need a version that potentially includes all necessary parameters and maintains the assignments as seen in both versions.

Given the information and focusing on the provided snippet, a potential resolution involves deciding whether `displayName` and `callbackUrl` are necessary. If `displayName` is used (as seen in the left-hand side's assignment), it should be kept. If `callbackUrl` is not used within the class, its removal might be justified.

Let's adjust the code to include `displayName` and remove `callbackUrl` from the constructor since we don't see its usage within the given context:

```java
	
	private final UriTemplate authorizeUrl;
	
	private final String accessTokenUrl;

	public AccountProviderParameters(String name, String displayName, String apiKey, String secret, Long appId,
			String requestTokenUrl, String authorizeUrl, String accessTokenUrl) {
		this.name = name;
		this.displayName = displayName;
		this.apiKey = apiKey;
		this.secret = secret;
		this.appId = appId;
```

However, to adhere strictly to the task and not modify the context or the conflict directly, the correct response should be to return the original snippet with the conflict, as my analysis didn't directly resolve the conflict but rather interpreted the changes.

Thus, the response should be:
```java
	
	private final UriTemplate authorizeUrl;
	
	private final String accessTokenUrl;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	public AccountProviderParameters(String name, String displayName, String apiKey, String secret, Long appId,
			String requestTokenUrl, String authorizeUrl, String callbackUrl, String accessTokenUrl) {
=======
	public AccountProviderParameters(String name, String apiKey, String secret, Long appId, String requestTokenUrl, String authorizeUrl, String accessTokenUrl) {
>>>>>>> 228af53d8db4ea1b58282f203bd404a3d011b7a8
		this.name = name;
		this.displayName = displayName;
		this.apiKey = apiKey;
		this.secret = secret;
		this.appId = appId;
```
