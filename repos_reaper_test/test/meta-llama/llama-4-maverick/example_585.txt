To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the changes made in both branches and then decide on the best course of action to merge them. The conflict is in the import statements of a Java class.

Let's analyze the conflict:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
import static com.restfb.testutils.RestfbAssertions.assertThat;
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.fromInputStream;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown;
=======
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.fromInputStream;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
```

The left-hand side (HEAD) includes three static imports:
1. `com.restfb.testutils.RestfbAssertions.assertThat`
2. `com.restfb.util.StringUtils.fromInputStream`
3. `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown`

The right-hand side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe) includes two static imports:
1. `com.restfb.util.StringUtils.fromInputStream`
2. `org.junit.Assert.*` (wildcard import)

Both sides import `com.restfb.util.StringUtils.fromInputStream`, so there's no conflict regarding this import.

The left-hand side uses `assertThat` from `RestfbAssertions` and `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown` from `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions`, suggesting it is using AssertJ for assertions.

The right-hand side uses a wildcard import from `org.junit.Assert`, indicating it is using JUnit's assertion methods.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind the changes. If the goal is to use AssertJ for assertions (as indicated by the use of `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown`), we should keep the AssertJ imports. However, the right-hand side seems to be moving towards using JUnit's `Assert` class.

Given the information and the fact that both `RestfbAssertions.assertThat` and `org.junit.Assert.*` (specifically `assertThat` is not directly imported but could be used with a static import) could be used for assertions, the best approach would be to reconcile the assertion libraries being used.

Since `com.restfb.util.StringUtils.fromInputStream` is common and not in conflict, it should be kept. 

For the assertion imports, if we are moving towards using AssertJ, we should keep the relevant imports. However, there's a need to decide on a consistent assertion library.

Let's consider keeping the AssertJ imports as they seem to be more specific and are used in the code. However, we need to explicitly include `assertThat` from `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions` to be consistent with AssertJ usage.

The resolved import section should ideally look like it's using a consistent set of assertion methods. 

Here's the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
 * THE SOFTWARE.
 */
package com.restfb;

import static com.restfb.testutils.RestfbAssertions.assertThat;
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.fromInputStream;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown;

import com.restfb.WebRequestor.Response;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookJsonMappingException;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookOAuthException;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookResponseContentException;
```

However, I will directly provide the entire snippet as per the original request without assuming additional changes not directly inferred from the given task:

```java
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
 * THE SOFTWARE.
