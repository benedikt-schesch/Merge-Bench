To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the given snippet:

```java
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
 * THE SOFTWARE.
 */
package com.restfb;

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import static com.restfb.logging.RestFBLogger.CLIENT_LOGGER;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.isBlank;
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.trimToEmpty;
import static com.restfb.util.UrlUtils.urlEncode;
import static java.util.Arrays.asList;
```

The conflict arises from the addition of a new import statement in one branch (`import static com.restfb.logging.RestFBLogger.CLIENT_LOGGER;`) that is not present in the other. To resolve this, we need to understand the intent behind this addition.

1. The new import statement is related to logging (`RestFBLogger.CLIENT_LOGGER`), suggesting that logging functionality is being introduced or utilized in the code.
2. The rest of the import statements are related to utility functions (`StringUtils` and `UrlUtils`) and a Java standard library function (`Arrays.asList`).

Since the new import is not conflicting with the existing imports semantically (they are importing different classes/methods), and assuming that the addition of `CLIENT_LOGGER` is intended to be used somewhere in the code (though not shown in this snippet), the most straightforward resolution is to include this new import.

The resolution involves deciding whether to keep the change introduced by the other branch (the one with the new import) or to discard it. Given that there's no indication that this new import is causing any issues (like duplicate class imports or conflicts with existing names), and assuming it's being used appropriately elsewhere in the code, the best course of action is to include it.

Thus, the resolved snippet should include the new import statement. Here is the resolution:

```java
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
 * THE SOFTWARE.
 */
package com.restfb;

import static com.restfb.logging.RestFBLogger.CLIENT_LOGGER;
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.isBlank;
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.trimToEmpty;
import static com.restfb.util.UrlUtils.urlEncode;
import static java.util.Arrays.asList;
```
