To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a larger application, possibly for a media or video browsing interface given the presence of `video`, `category`, and `CardPresenter`. The conflict arises in the context of managing a list of videos categorized under different headers.

The conflict is within the `if (row != null)` block and the declaration of `listRowAdapter`. On one side (HEAD), the code casts `row.getAdapter()` to `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` and creates a `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` for `listRowAdapter`. On the other side (308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5), it casts to and creates a `SortedObjectAdapter` instead.

Let's examine the intent:

1. **Existing Row Handling**: When a row for a category already exists (`row != null`), the code adds a new video to the adapter associated with that row. The conflict here is between using `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` and `SortedObjectAdapter`. Both seem to be related to sorting and managing a collection of objects, but their exact nature (whether they're related, one is a subclass of the other, or they serve distinct purposes) isn't clear from the snippet alone.

2. **New Row Creation**: If the row doesn't exist, a new adapter is created, and a `ListRow` is added to `mAdapter`. Here again, the conflict revolves around the type of adapter to be used: `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` vs. `SortedObjectAdapter`.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to understand the intent behind the change from `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` to `SortedObjectAdapter`. If `SortedObjectAdapter` is a more general or superclass interface that `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` extends or implements, and if the functionality required here can work with the more general interface, then the change might be towards making the code more flexible or compatible with different types of sorted adapters.

However, without knowing the exact relationship between `SortedArrayObjectAdapter` and `SortedObjectAdapter`, or the specific requirements of the application (e.g., whether it needs the specific features of `SortedArrayObjectAdapter`), it's challenging to make a definitive decision.

Given that both sides are making similar changes (casting and creating an adapter of a certain type) but differ in the type, and assuming there's a valid reason for both types to exist in the codebase, the resolution depends on understanding the broader context or the specific requirements of the application.

Since `SortedObjectAdapter` seems to be a potentially more general or abstract type, and if we assume that it encompasses the functionality needed here, we could lean towards using `SortedObjectAdapter`. However, this is speculative without more context.

Let's return the snippet with the conflict, as the intent is not entirely clear and to avoid potentially introducing inconsistencies or breaking functionality.

```java
                    ListRow row = findListRow(category);

                    // if found add this video
                    // if not, create a new row and add it
                    if (row != null) {

                        ((SortedArrayObjectAdapter) row.getAdapter()).add(video);
                    } else {
                        SortedArrayObjectAdapter listRowAdapter = new SortedArrayObjectAdapter(

                        ((SortedObjectAdapter) row.getAdapter()).add(video);
                    } else {
                        SortedObjectAdapter listRowAdapter = new SortedObjectAdapter(

                        listRowAdapter.add(video);

                        HeaderItem header = new HeaderItem(0, category, null);
                        mAdapter.add(0, new ListRow(header, listRowAdapter));
