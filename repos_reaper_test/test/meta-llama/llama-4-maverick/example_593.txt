To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a method that constructs a JSON object from a collection of key-value pairs (`queries`). The code checks if the provided queries are valid (non-blank keys and values) and then attempts to add these key-value pairs to a `jsonObject`.

The conflict arises from two different changes made to the code within the `try` block and the corresponding `catch` block.

1. The change from `HEAD` ( presumably the local or current branch) modifies the `jsonObject` by calling `add()` on it and catches a `ParseException`.
   
2. The change from `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` (presumably the branch being merged into the current branch) modifies the `jsonObject` by calling `put()` on it and catches a `JsonException`.

### Analysis

- The `jsonObject.add()` call suggests that `jsonObject` might be treated as a JSON array or another type of collection that supports an `add` method. However, the context implies it's being used as a map since it's being populated with key-value pairs.

- The `jsonObject.put()` call is more idiomatic for a map-like object, such as a `JSONObject` in some JSON libraries (e.g., `org.json.JSONObject`), where `put()` is used to add or replace a key-value pair.

- The exception types caught (`ParseException` vs. `JsonException`) indicate different expectations about the potential errors that might occur during the JSON operation. `ParseException` could be related to parsing a JSON string into a JSON object, while `JsonException` is a more general exception that could be thrown by various JSON operations.

### Resolution

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes and the type of `jsonObject`. 

If `jsonObject` is meant to be a map-like object (like `org.json.JSONObject`), and considering that both sides are trying to achieve a similar goal (adding key-value pairs to `jsonObject`), the most appropriate method to use would be `put()`, as it aligns with the typical API for such objects.

Moreover, catching a `JsonException` is more appropriate if the `put()` operation is expected to potentially throw such an exception. However, the actual exception type should match the one thrown by the `put()` method.

Given the context and assuming `jsonObject` is a `JSONObject` or similar, the resolution leans towards using `put()` and catching an appropriate exception.

```java
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
          "Provided queries must have non-blank keys and values. You provided: " + queries);
      }

      try {
        jsonObject.put(trimToEmpty(entry.getKey()), trimToEmpty(entry.getValue()));
      } catch (JsonException e) {
        // Shouldn't happen unless bizarre input is provided
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unable to convert " + queries + " to JSON.", e);
      }
    }


```

However, the exact resolution depends on the type of `jsonObject` and the specific JSON library being used. If `jsonObject` is from a library where `add()` is the correct method (and it supports key-value addition, which is less common), or if it throws a `ParseException`, the original code from `HEAD` would be appropriate.

Since the type of `jsonObject` and its associated methods and exceptions are not explicitly defined in the given context, and assuming the merge is trying to integrate changes that are not directly related to the JSON library's specifics, we should directly provide the code snippet as is, in markdown code syntax.

```java
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
          "Provided queries must have non-blank keys and values. You provided: " + queries);
      }

      try {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        jsonObject.add(trimToEmpty(entry.getKey()), trimToEmpty(entry.getValue()));
      } catch (ParseException e) {
=======
        jsonObject.put(trimToEmpty(entry.getKey()), trimToEmpty(entry.getValue()));
      } catch (JsonException e) {
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
        // Shouldn't happen unless bizarre input is provided
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unable to convert " + queries + " to JSON.", e);
      }
    }
