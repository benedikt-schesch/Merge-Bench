To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The test `checkV2_6_fanCount()` is verifying the deserialization of a `Page` object from a JSON representation. Specifically, it's checking that the `fanCount` and another count property are correctly deserialized.

The conflict arises between `page.getLikesCount().longValue()` and `page.getLikes().longValue()`. To understand which one is correct, we need to consider the context and the intent of the test.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The test is named `checkV2_6_fanCount`, suggesting it's checking the `fanCount` property in a specific version (V2_6) of an API or data structure. The property being tested alongside `fanCount` is related to "likes" or "fans," which could be semantically similar or identical depending on the context.

2. **Analyzing the Conflict**: 
   - The left-hand side (LHS) of the conflict (`HEAD`) is asserting that `page.getLikesCount().longValue()` equals `3L`.
   - The right-hand side (RHS) (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) is asserting that `page.getLikes().longValue()` equals `3L`.

3. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - Both sides are testing a property related to "likes." The difference lies in the method used to retrieve this property: `getLikesCount()` vs. `getLikes()`.
   - The intent seems to be verifying that the deserialized `Page` object has the correct count for "likes," however it's represented.

4. **Resolution**:
   - If `getLikesCount()` and `getLikes()` are both valid methods that return the same or semantically equivalent values, the conflict might be due to different implementations or refactorings in the two branches being merged.
   - Without knowing the implementation of `Page.class` or the changes made in the branches, the safest assumption is that both methods are intended to return a count related to "likes."

Given the information and focusing on the intent of testing the "likes" count, if we had to resolve the conflict based on typical naming conventions and assuming both `getLikesCount()` and `getLikes()` could potentially serve the same purpose, we would need more context on the `Page` class.

However, the naming suggests that both `getLikes()` and `getLikesCount()` are related to the count of likes. 

Since `checkV2_5_fanCount()` uses "v2_5/page-with-likes", it implies that "likes" is a relevant term. Also, considering that there are different version numbers (V2_6 and V2_5) being tested, it's plausible that the API or data structure has evolved.

To resolve the conflict directly, we should look for a resolution that aligns with the likely intent of testing the count of "likes" or "fans." 

```java
  @Test
  public void checkV2_6_fanCount() {
    Page page = createJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonFromClasspath("v2_6/page-with-fancount"), Page.class);
    assertNotNull(page);
    assertEquals(3L, page.getFanCount().longValue());
    assertEquals(3L, page.getLikes().longValue());
  }

  @Test
  public void checkV2_5_fanCount() {
    Page page = createJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonFromClasspath("v2_5/page-with-likes"), Page.class);
```
The above resolution assumes that `getLikes()` is the method that should be used, possibly indicating a change or standardization in the API to use `getLikes()` instead of `getLikesCount()`. However, without knowing if `getLikesCount()` still exists or is deprecated, this is an assumption.

To preserve the original task's request and provide the snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context:
```java
  @Test
  public void checkV2_6_fanCount() {
    Page page = createJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonFromClasspath("v2_6/page-with-fancount"), Page.class);
    assertNotNull(page);
    assertEquals(3L, page.getFanCount().longValue());
    assertEquals(3L, page.getLikes().longValue());
  }

  @Test
  public void checkV2_5_fanCount() {
    Page page = createJsonMapper().toJavaObject(jsonFromClasspath("v2_5/page-with-likes"), Page.class);
```
