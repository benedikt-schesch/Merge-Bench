To resolve the given merge conflict, we must first understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The conflict is within the `getClassForAlias` method, specifically around the declaration and type of the `funcSpec` variable.

On the `HEAD` side (the local changes), `funcSpec` is declared as a `String` and initialized to `null` along with `className`. 

On the other side (the changes from the commit `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`), `funcSpec` is declared as a `FuncSpec` object and initialized to `null` separately from `className`.

Let's analyze the usage of `funcSpec`:
1. It is retrieved from `definedFunctions.get(alias)` and assigned to `funcSpec`.
2. The check `if (funcSpec != null)` is performed.

The type of `funcSpec` on the `HEAD` side is `String`, while on the other side, it's `FuncSpec`. The method `definedFunctions.get(alias)` is expected to return a value that can be assigned to `funcSpec`. The fact that the other side has changed the type to `FuncSpec` suggests that `definedFunctions.get(alias)` returns a `FuncSpec` object.

Given the information and the fact that there's no explicit type casting or other hints in the provided snippet that could help in directly resolving the type discrepancy, the most semantically correct resolution is to align the type of `funcSpec` with what is being retrieved from `definedFunctions.get(alias)`, which appears to be `FuncSpec` based on the other side's change.

However, directly changing the type to `FuncSpec` without knowing the context or the type expected by `HEAD` might not be correct. We need to ensure that the change does not break the functionality intended by `HEAD`.

Since `className` is used but not shown in the conflict, and assuming `FuncSpec` is a valid type, the resolution involves deciding on the type of `funcSpec`. 

Let's look at the provided code snippet again and resolve it:

```java
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }
    
    
    public Class getClassForAlias(String alias) throws IOException{
<<<<<<< HEAD
        String className, funcSpec = null;
=======
        String className = null;
        FuncSpec funcSpec = null;
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        if (definedFunctions != null) {
            funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias);
        }
        if (funcSpec != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent, we should consider the type that `definedFunctions.get(alias)` returns and how it's used later in the code.

Given the context isn't fully available, a straightforward resolution is to use the type that seems to be the intended return type from `definedFunctions.get(alias)`, which is `FuncSpec`. However, without the full context of how `funcSpec` and `className` are used, the safest resolution is to present the code as is.

The resolution:
```java
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }
    
    
    public Class getClassForAlias(String alias) throws IOException{
        String className = null;
        FuncSpec funcSpec = null;
        if (definedFunctions != null) {
            funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias);
        }
        if (funcSpec != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
```
However, to fully resolve and return the snippet as requested:


```java
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }
    
    
    public Class getClassForAlias(String alias) throws IOException{
        String className = null;
        FuncSpec funcSpec = null;
        if (definedFunctions != null) {
            funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias);
        }
        if (funcSpec != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
```
