To resolve the given merge conflict, let's examine the context and the changes introduced on both sides of the conflict.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a method that handles the import of some data ( potentially related to user permissions or access rights) and checks for ambiguous principals (users or groups) during this process. The conflict arises when constructing a message (`text` variable) to be potentially displayed or logged regarding these ambiguous principals.

### Changes on Both Sides

- **Left Side (HEAD):** The left side constructs a message (`text`) that mentions multiple candidates for resource access permissions or node ownership during data deployment. The list of ambiguous principals is joined with `String.join()`, and the message includes a specific phrasing and HTML formatting.

- **Right Side (83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965):** The right side also constructs a similar message but with slight variations. It uses `ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>"))` to sort the list of ambiguous principals before joining them, and there's a slight difference in the wording of the message.

### Intent and Semantics

The intent on both sides seems to be to inform the user about ambiguous principals that could not be resolved during data deployment, affecting node access rights. The semantics involve constructing a clear and informative message.

1. **Sorting Ambiguous Principals:** The right side sorts the principals before listing them, which could be considered an improvement for readability and consistency, as it presents the list in a predictable order.

2. **Phrasing and Formatting:** Both sides have slight differences in phrasing ("resource access permissions or node ownership" vs. "grants or node ownership" and "." vs. "!"). The change to "grants" might be more concise or contextually appropriate depending on the application's terminology.

### Resolution

To resolve the conflict, we should aim to preserve the intent and improvements from both sides where possible.

```java
}

if (!ambiguousPrincipals.isEmpty()) {

    final String title = "Ambiguous Principal(s)";
    final String text = "For the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for grants or node ownership during <b>data deployment</b>.<br>"
            + "Because of this ambiguity, <b>node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported</b>."
            + "<ul><li>" + ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>")) + "</li></ul>"
            + "Consider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.";

    logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
            + "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
```
