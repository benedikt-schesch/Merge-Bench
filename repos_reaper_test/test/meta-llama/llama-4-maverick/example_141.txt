To resolve the merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a Java method named `copyFromLocalToCluster` that copies a local file to a mini cluster. The method takes three parameters: a cluster object, a local file name, and a file name on the cluster.

The conflicting code is in the method signature and the initial lines of the method body.

On one side (HEAD), the method signature is:
```java
static public void copyFromLocalToCluster(MiniGenericCluster cluster,
        String localFileName, String fileNameOnCluster) throws IOException {
```
On the other side (8923da8cd49c041d99fd5996ddf807f54915c79e), the method signature is:
```java
static public void copyFromLocalToCluster(MiniCluster cluster, String localFileName, String fileNameOnCluster) throws IOException {
    if(Util.WINDOWS){
        localFileName = localFileName.replace('\\','/');
        fileNameOnCluster = fileNameOnCluster.replace('\\','/');
    }
```
The difference between the two sides is the type of the `cluster` parameter (`MiniGenericCluster` vs `MiniCluster`) and the presence of a conditional statement to replace backslashes with forward slashes on Windows.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind these changes.

1. The change from `MiniGenericCluster` to `MiniCluster` might be due to a refactoring or a change in the cluster implementation. 
2. The addition of the conditional statement to replace backslashes with forward slashes on Windows is likely intended to handle file path differences between Windows and other operating systems.

Since the rest of the method body is not conflicting and uses the `cluster` object to create a `PigServer`, it is likely that the change to `MiniCluster` is compatible with the rest of the method.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:
```java
	 * @param cluster a reference to the minicluster
	 * @param localFileName the pathname of local file
	 * @param fileNameOnCluster the name with which the file should be created on the minicluster
	 * @throws IOException
	 */
	static public void copyFromLocalToCluster(MiniCluster cluster, String localFileName, String fileNameOnCluster) throws IOException {
        if(Util.WINDOWS){
            localFileName = localFileName.replace('\\','/');
            fileNameOnCluster = fileNameOnCluster.replace('\\','/');
        }
        PigServer ps = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
        String script = getMkDirCommandForHadoop2_0(fileNameOnCluster) + "fs -put " + localFileName + " " + fileNameOnCluster;

	    GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));
        parser.setInteractive(false);
```
