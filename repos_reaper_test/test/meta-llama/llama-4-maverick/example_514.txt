To resolve this merge conflict, we need to examine the changes made on both sides and understand their intent.

The conflict is in the line where `this.mFontTexture` is initialized. The local changes (`HEAD`) have it as:
```java
this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTexture(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
```
While the incoming changes (`91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d`) have it as:
```java
this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
```
The difference lies in the class used to create `this.mFontTexture`: `BitmapTexture` vs `BitmapTextureAtlas`.

To resolve the conflict, we should consider the semantic intent behind both changes. The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of an Android game or application using the AndEngine library.

1. `BitmapTexture` is used in the local version (`HEAD`). This suggests that the local changes might be using a version of AndEngine or a similar library where `BitmapTexture` is the correct or preferred class for creating a texture from a bitmap.

2. `BitmapTextureAtlas` is used in the incoming changes. `BitmapTextureAtlas` is a class commonly used in AndEngine to manage textures, especially when dealing with multiple textures or texture atlasing. The change to `BitmapTextureAtlas` could indicate an update or modification that aligns with the library's API or best practices.

Given the context and the names of the classes involved, `BitmapTextureAtlas` seems to be the more appropriate or updated choice for AndEngine, as it is a part of the engine's texture management system.

However, without more information about the specific versions of the library being used on both sides of the merge or the exact requirements of the project, it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict based solely on the provided snippet.

Since `BitmapTextureAtlas` appears to be a more specific and appropriate class for texture management in AndEngine, and assuming the incoming changes are based on a more current or compatible version of the library, the conflict can be resolved by choosing the `BitmapTextureAtlas` version. 

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:
```java
	return new Engine(new EngineOptions(true, ScreenOrientation.LANDSCAPE, new RatioResolutionPolicy(CAMERA_WIDTH, CAMERA_HEIGHT), this.mCamera));
}

@Override
public void onLoadResources() {
	this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);

	this.mFont = new Font(this.mFontTexture, Typeface.create(Typeface.DEFAULT, Typeface.BOLD), 32, true, Color.BLACK);

	this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mFontTexture);
	this.mEngine.getFontManager().loadFont(this.mFont);
```
