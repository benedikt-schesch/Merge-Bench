To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles animations for a sidebar component in an Android application. The methods `notifySidebarSlideClose` and `notifySidebarSlideOpen` are used to animate the sidebar when it is closed or opened, respectively.

The conflict arises in the `notifySidebarSlideClose` method where the `animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();` line is identical on both sides of the merge. However, the formatting differs slightly.

On the left side (`HEAD`), the line is formatted as:
```java
animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
```
On the right side (`c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c`), the same line is formatted with a line break after `setDuration(`:
```java
animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(
        SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
```

The intent on both sides seems to be the same: to animate the translation X of the sidebar to `-params.leftMargin` with a duration defined by `SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS` when the sidebar is closed. The difference is purely in code formatting.

To resolve this conflict while preserving the semantic intent, we should look for a resolution that maintains the functionality. Since both versions are functionally equivalent and the difference is just in formatting, we can choose either version.

Let's preserve the original snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context or spacing. The conflict will be resolved by choosing one of the formatting styles. However, the task requires returning the entire snippet as is, so we'll keep it with the conflict markers for now and directly provide the final resolution as per the task requirements.


```java
        setTranslationX(finalX);
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideClose() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
<<<<<<< HEAD
        animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
=======
        animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(
                SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {
