To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a logging or reporting mechanism within a larger application, possibly related to data import/export and permission management. The conflict arises in the construction of a log message that warns about ambiguous principals (users or groups) during data deployment.

### Understanding the Conflict

The conflict is in the following section of the code:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
					+ "\tFor the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for resource access permissions or node ownership during data deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of this ambiguity, node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported.\n\n"
					+ "\t" + String.join("\n\t",  ambiguousPrincipals)
=======
					+ "\tFor the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for grants or node ownership during data deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of this ambiguity, node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported!\n\n"
					+ "\t" + ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
>>>>>>> 83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965
```

### Analyzing the Changes

- The `HEAD` version (left side of the conflict) uses the phrase "resource access permissions or node ownership" and does not sort the `ambiguousPrincipals` before joining them into a string.
- The other version (right side of the conflict, from commit `83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965`) uses "grants or node ownership" and sorts `ambiguousPrincipals` before joining them.

### Resolving the Conflict

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions. Both changes seem to be related to how the ambiguity is described and how the list of ambiguous principals is processed.

1. **Description of Ambiguity**: The `HEAD` version refers to "resource access permissions or node ownership," while the other version simplifies this to "grants or node ownership." The term "grants" could be considered more concise or relevant in certain contexts, potentially making the message clearer.

2. **Processing of Ambiguous Principals**: The `HEAD` version simply joins the `ambiguousPrincipals` with a newline and a tab (`\n\t`), while the other version sorts them before doing so. Sorting the principals can make the output more predictable and easier to compare across different runs or scenarios.

### Resolution

Given that both changes have some merit (the description change might be for clarity or consistency with other parts of the codebase, and sorting the principals is a good practice for readability and consistency), a reasonable resolution could be to incorporate both changes. This would involve using the clearer or more consistent description from the other version and adopting the sorting of `ambiguousPrincipals` for better output readability.

Here's the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
>>>>>>> 83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965
					+ "Consider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.";

			logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
					+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
					+ "\tFor the following names, there are multiple candidates (User/Group) for grants or node ownership during data deployment.\n"
					+ "\tBecause of this ambiguity, node access rights could not be restored as defined in the export you just imported!\n\n"
					+ "\t" + ambiguousPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
					+ "\n\n\tConsider clearing up such ambiguities in the database.\n"
					+ "###############################################################################"
			);
			publishWarningMessage(title, text);
		}
