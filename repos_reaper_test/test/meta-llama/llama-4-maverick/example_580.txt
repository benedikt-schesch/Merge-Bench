To resolve the merge conflict, let's first understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that represents a Facebook user's data, given the `@Facebook` annotation. The conflict revolves around the `picture` field.

On the `HEAD` side (the local changes), the `picture` field is of type `ProfilePictureSource` and is annotated with `@Getter` and `@Setter`, which are Lombok annotations that automatically generate getter and setter methods for the field.

On the `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` side (the changes from the other branch or commit), the `picture` field is of type `String`.

Both versions of the `picture` field seem to be related to a user's profile picture, but they represent it differently. The `rawPicture` field, which is not in conflict, is of type `JsonObject` and is annotated with `@Facebook("picture")`, suggesting it's directly mapped from a "picture" field in the Facebook data.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider what the intent of both changes is. The `HEAD` side is using a specific type (`ProfilePictureSource`) for the picture, which might offer more structured information about the picture. The other side is using a `String`, which could represent a simpler or different interpretation of the picture data, possibly just a URL.

Without more context about why `ProfilePictureSource` is being used on one side and `String` on the other, it's challenging to determine the correct resolution. However, given that there's also a `rawPicture` field that seems to capture the raw data from Facebook, it suggests that both representations might be useful.

That being said, directly resolving this without knowing the specific requirements or the rest of the codebase is difficult. 

Since the intent is ambiguous and we don't have enough information to confidently resolve the conflict in a way that retains the necessary functionality from both sides, the original snippet with the conflict should be returned.
