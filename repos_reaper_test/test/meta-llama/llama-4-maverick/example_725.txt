To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the intent of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and defines an interface named `ABActivityViewer`. The comments above the interface declaration explain that this interface is part of the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern's View layer, related to UI, and that Activities implementing this interface will contain a reference to a Presenter. When certain events occur, such as a button click, the interface methods will be used to call the corresponding methods in the Presenter layer.

The merge conflict occurs because the two branches being merged have different definitions for the `ABActivityViewer` interface.

1. The version from the `HEAD` (typically the current branch being worked on) defines the interface as `public interface ABActivityViewer {`.

2. The version being merged into the current branch (`a4d77b017980dbe4d731dc090d4cd8cd3c2d9364`) defines the interface as `public interface ABActivityViewer extends TaskController {`, indicating that `ABActivityViewer` should extend another interface named `TaskController`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes.

- The `HEAD` version keeps the interface simple and focused on its original definition related to the MVP pattern's View layer.

- The version from `a4d77b017980dbe4d731dc090d4cd8cd3c2d9364` extends the interface to include the methods or functionalities defined in `TaskController`, suggesting an additional responsibility or capability for `ABActivityViewer`, possibly related to task control.

Without knowing the specifics of `TaskController` and its implications, the safest resolution that maintains both intents (if they are not conflicting) would be to extend `ABActivityViewer` with `TaskController` as done in the merged version. However, this should be done with the understanding that `ABActivityViewer` now inherits all the methods from `TaskController` and must implement them.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
 * Date: 7/17/14.
 * <p/>
 * MVP的View层，UI相关，Activity需要实现该interface
 * 它会包含一个Presenter的引用，当有事件发生（比如按钮点击后），会调用Presenter层的方法
 */
public interface ABActivityViewer extends TaskController{

    /**
     * 显示Toast信息
     *
     * @param message
```
