To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes made on both sides of the conflict.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class, likely `FileDataStoreFactory`, given the reference to `FileDataStoreFactory.class.getName()`. The snippet is within a static initializer block, which is used to initialize static variables. Here, it's used to determine if the operating system is Windows and handle any exceptions that might occur during this determination.

The conflict arises in the `catch` block of the `try-catch` statement. The `try` block attempts to determine if the operating system is Windows by checking the `OS_NAME` system property. If any `Throwable` (a broad category that includes `Exception` and `Error`) is thrown during this process, the `catch` block is executed.

On the `HEAD` side (the local branch or the branch being merged into), the code logs the error message using a `Logger` with the level set to `severe`.

On the other side of the merge (represented by the commit hash `6209970654c0b8d65624d98e1b49da29a99ee356`), the code has been modified to:

1. Comment out the logging line.
2. Print the stack trace of the exception (`ex.printStackTrace();`).
3. Print a line of asterisks (`*********************************************************`) to `System.out`.
4. Print the error message (`ex.getMessage()`) to `System.out`.

Both sides of the merge then re-throw the caught `Throwable` (`throw ex;`), which means the difference in handling is primarily about how the error is reported before it's re-thrown.

To resolve this conflict, we must consider the intent behind each change. The `HEAD` side sticks with logging the error message, which is a standard practice in many applications for error handling, especially when the error occurs during initialization. The other side introduces more verbose error reporting directly to `System.out`, which might be useful for debugging purposes but is less typical for standard logging practices in production environments.

Since both sides are handling the exception but in different manners, and given that the re-throwing of the exception is consistent across both versions, a resolution that preserves the intent of both could involve keeping the more detailed error reporting (including the stack trace) while possibly using a logging framework for consistency with typical Java practices.

However, directly merging these without considering the logging framework's capabilities and the application's requirements might not be straightforward. A straightforward resolution isn't immediately clear without more context on the logging practices and requirements of the application.

Given this analysis and sticking strictly to the task instructions without modifying the original context or spacing:

```java
  static {
    try {
      IS_WINDOWS =
          StandardSystemProperty.OS_NAME.value().toLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH).startsWith("windows");
    } catch (Throwable ex) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      Logger.getLogger(FileDataStoreFactory.class.getName()).severe(ex.getMessage());
=======
      // Logger.getLogger(FileDataStoreFactory.class.getName()).severe(ex.getMessage());
      ex.printStackTrace();
      System.out.println("*********************************************************");
      System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
>>>>>>> 6209970654c0b8d65624d98e1b49da29a99ee356
      throw ex;
    }
  }

  /** Directory to store data. */
```

Should be returned as is because the task requires returning the snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context or resolving the conflict if the intent is ambiguous. Thus, the response remains:

```java
  static {
    try {
      IS_WINDOWS =
          StandardSystemProperty.OS_NAME.value().toLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH).startsWith("windows");
    } catch (Throwable ex) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      Logger.getLogger(FileDataStoreFactory.class.getName()).severe(ex.getMessage());
=======
      // Logger.getLogger(FileDataStoreFactory.class.getName()).severe(ex.getMessage());
      ex.printStackTrace();
      System.out.println("*********************************************************");
      System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
>>>>>>> 6209970654c0b8d65624d98e1b49da29a99ee356
      throw ex;
    }
  }

  /** Directory to store data. */
