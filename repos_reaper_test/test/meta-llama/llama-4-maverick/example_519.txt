To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The code snippet is written in Java and includes several import statements for various classes and interfaces from the Guava library (`com.google.common.base.Objects`, `com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList`, `com.google.common.collect.Iterables`), a custom or third-party class (`nodebox.graphics.Point`), and Java's standard library (`java.util` package and `java.util.regex` package).

The merge conflict arises from the difference in import statements between the two merging branches or commits. Specifically, the conflict is around the import of `java.util.Collection` and `java.util.HashMap`.

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.HashMap;
=======
>>>>>>> d2c4b48a67b5a53af33a9e7c46d442403328efea
```

The left-hand side (`HEAD`) includes imports for `java.util.Collection` and `java.util.HashMap`, indicating that these classes are used somewhere in the code. The right-hand side (`d2c4b48a67b5a53af33a9e7c46d442403328efea`) does not include these imports, suggesting either that these classes are not needed due to changes made in this branch, or the necessary changes to remove their usage are made elsewhere in the code.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes on both sides:

1. **The `HEAD` side** is using `java.util.Collection` and `java.util.HashMap`, indicating that the code somewhere utilizes these classes.

2. **The other side (`d2c4b48a67b5a53af33a9e7c46d442403328efea`)** has removed the imports for `java.util.Collection` and `java.util.HashMap`, which could mean that the usage of these classes has been removed or refactored out.

If the removal of `java.util.Collection` and `java.util.HashMap` imports on the right-hand side was due to their usage being completely removed or replaced in the code, and if the code still compiles and runs correctly without these imports, then the correct resolution would be to remove these imports.

However, without the actual code that uses (or doesn't use) these imports, we can't be certain whether removing `java.util.Collection` and `java.util.HashMap` imports will cause compilation issues.

Given this context, the safest resolution, when unsure, is to preserve the conflict or resolve based on the actual usage in the code. Let's examine the provided snippet again.

Since we do not have the actual code that is being imported, a safe resolution would be to keep the imports as they were in `HEAD` if they are actually used, or remove them if they are not. 

Let's return the original snippet as it was, since we are instructed not to modify the context, and to return it in markdown code syntax:


```java

import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;
import com.google.common.collect.Iterables;
