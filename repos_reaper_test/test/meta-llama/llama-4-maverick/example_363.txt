To resolve the merge conflict, we need to analyze the given code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The given code snippet is in Java and is part of a method that creates a `GoogleUrl` object based on the provided parameters. The conflict arises in the line where it iterates over the entries of a map created from the `parameters` object.

```java
  public static GoogleUrl create(String encodedServerUrl, String pathTemplate, Object parameters)
      throws IllegalArgumentException {
    GoogleUrl url = new GoogleUrl(encodedServerUrl);

    HashMap<String, Object> requestMap = new HashMap<String, Object>();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    for (Map.Entry<String, Object> entry : DataUtil.mapOf(parameters).entrySet()) {
=======
    for (Map.Entry<String, Object> entry : Data.mapOf(parameters).entrySet()) {
>>>>>>> f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b
      Object value = entry.getValue();
      if (value != null) {
        requestMap.put(entry.getKey(), value);
      }
    }
```

Looking at the conflict, it seems that the change is related to how the `parameters` object is being converted into a map. On one side (`HEAD`), it's using `DataUtil.mapOf(parameters)`, and on the other side (`f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b`), it's using `Data.mapOf(parameters)`.

The intent seems to be about using a utility method to convert the `parameters` into a map, but the utility class or method name differs between `DataUtil` and `Data`. 

Given the information, it appears that `DataUtil` and `Data` are likely utility classes that provide a `mapOf` method. The conflict resolution depends on understanding which of these classes (`DataUtil` or `Data`) is the correct or preferred one to use in the context of the project.

Without additional context about the project structure, the existence, and the purpose of `DataUtil` and `Data` classes, it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict.

However, to follow the instructions precisely and given that the conflict cannot be resolved with the provided information without potentially altering the intended functionality, the original snippet with the conflict is returned as is, in markdown code syntax:

```java
  public static GoogleUrl create(String encodedServerUrl, String pathTemplate, Object parameters)
      throws IllegalArgumentException {
    GoogleUrl url = new GoogleUrl(encodedServerUrl);

    HashMap<String, Object> requestMap = new HashMap<String, Object>();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    for (Map.Entry<String, Object> entry : DataUtil.mapOf(parameters).entrySet()) {
=======
    for (Map.Entry<String, Object> entry : Data.mapOf(parameters).entrySet()) {
>>>>>>> f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b
      Object value = entry.getValue();
      if (value != null) {
        requestMap.put(entry.getKey(), value);
      }
    }
```
