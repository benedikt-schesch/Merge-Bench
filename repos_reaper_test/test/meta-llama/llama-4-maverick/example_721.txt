To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of an Android application due to the use of `UiThread` and an event bus (`App.bus.post`). The method `onFinished` seems to be a callback that is invoked when some asynchronous operation is completed, indicated by receiving a `Void` result.

The conflict arises in the `onFinished` method where there are differences between the local (`HEAD`) version and the version being merged (`2d52502932f7e7875f4269e8198e522945bcf696`).

1. **Understanding the Change in `HEAD`**: The local version (`HEAD`) includes a logging statement (`Logger.log`) that records a message indicating "Failed message deleted". This suggests that the code in `HEAD` is logging when a message is considered deleted or handled after some operation is finished.

2. **Understanding the Change in the Merged Version**: The version being merged (`2d52502932f7e7875f4269e8198e522945bcf696`) does not include the logging statement. Instead, it directly posts a `ReloadMessagesEvent` on the application bus.

3. **Analyzing the Intent**: Both versions of the code post a `ReloadMessagesEvent` after the operation is finished. The difference lies in whether to log a message before posting the event. The logging statement in `HEAD` suggests that there's an intent to track or debug the deletion or handling of a failed message.

4. **Resolving the Conflict**: To resolve the conflict, we need to decide whether the logging statement is essential. If the intent is to both log the event and then reload messages, we should preserve the logging statement and the event posting. If the logging is not necessary or is redundant, we can remove it.

Since the logging statement is not conflicting with the functionality of posting the `ReloadMessagesEvent` and serves a potentially useful purpose for debugging or tracking, the most straightforward resolution would be to keep both the logging statement and the event posting.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
                            @Override
                            public void onFinished(Void result) {
                                UiThread.getInstance().post(new Runnable() {
                                    @Override
                                    public void run() {
                                        Logger.log(SmsSentReceiver.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed message deleted ");
                                        App.bus.post(new ReloadMessagesEvent());
                                    }
                                });
                            }
```

However, since the task requires returning the entire snippet (including full context) as it was provided and only modifying the conflict, and given that there's no other conflicting section in the provided snippet other than the one within `onFinished` and an empty line at the end, the corrected version with conflict resolved would be:
```java
                            @Override
                            public void onFinished(Void result) {
                                UiThread.getInstance().post(new Runnable() {
                                    @Override
                                    public void run() {
                                        Logger.log(SmsSentReceiver.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed message deleted ");
                                        App.bus.post(new ReloadMessagesEvent());
                                    }
                                });
                            }

```
