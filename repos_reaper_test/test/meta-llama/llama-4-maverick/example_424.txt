To resolve the given merge conflict, we need to analyze the changes made on both sides of the merge and understand their intent.

The conflict is in the import statements section of the Java code. The left-hand side (HEAD) has imports related to `DocumentTypes` and `DataFileUtil`, while the right-hand side (1b5691ad2a7d734321d0382e71743a85835556b3) has imports related to `DocumentModel` and `ModelAttributes`.

Let's look at the imports on both sides:
- Left-hand side (HEAD): `org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes` and `org.jbake.util.DataFileUtil`
- Right-hand side: `org.jbake.model.DocumentModel` and `org.jbake.model.ModelAttributes`

Both sides are importing classes from the `org.jbake.model` package, suggesting that the changes are related to the model or document handling in the application. The left-hand side is also importing from `org.jbake.util`, indicating a utility class is being used.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider whether the changes on both sides are complementary or if one side supersedes the other. Since the imports are from related packages (`org.jbake.model`), it's likely that both sides are making changes to the document or model handling logic.

Without the actual code that uses these imports, it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict. However, we can attempt to include all the imports from both sides, as they seem to be related to the application's model and document handling.

Here's the potential resolution:
```java
package org.jbake.app;

import org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;
import org.hamcrest.BaseMatcher;
import org.hamcrest.Description;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes;
import org.jbake.util.DataFileUtil;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.jbake.model.ModelAttributes;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.BeforeClass;
import org.junit.Test;
```

Let's return the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
package org.jbake.app;

import org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;
import org.hamcrest.BaseMatcher;
import org.hamcrest.Description;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes;
import org.jbake.util.DataFileUtil;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.jbake.model.ModelAttributes;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.BeforeClass;
import org.junit.Test;
```
