To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The code snippet appears to be a part of a Java class, likely used for mapping Facebook data to Java objects, given the `@Facebook` annotation. The class has fields representing different types of user data: devices, work experience, education, etc. These fields are annotated with `@Facebook`, suggesting they are mapped from Facebook's API response.

The conflict arises in the declaration of the `work` field. On one side (HEAD), it is declared as `private List<WorkExperience> work = new ArrayList<WorkExperience>();`, indicating that the type of objects it can hold are of `WorkExperience`. On the other side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe), it is declared as `private List<Work> work = new ArrayList<Work>();`, indicating it can hold objects of type `Work`.

To resolve this, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. 

1. The `WorkExperience` type suggests a detailed experience, potentially including information like job title, employer, duration, etc.
2. The `Work` type is more generic and could either be an equivalent representation of `WorkExperience` or something different, potentially more general or abstract.

Without knowing the exact definitions of `WorkExperience` and `Work`, we have a few possibilities:

- If `Work` and `WorkExperience` are essentially representing the same concept and one is a rename or refactoring of the other, then the resolution depends on which one is considered the correct or final representation.
- If they represent different concepts or levels of detail, then the conflict is not just about resolving a technical merge but understanding the semantic difference.

Given the information available:

- If `Work` is a new type that is intended to replace `WorkExperience`, and there's a corresponding change elsewhere in the codebase to support this (e.g., in how data is mapped or used), then the correct resolution would be to use `private List<Work> work = new ArrayList<Work>();`.
- If `WorkExperience` is the established type and `Work` is either not relevant or not correctly integrated, then the resolution would be to stick with `private List<WorkExperience> work = new ArrayList<WorkExperience>();`.

However, without more context about `Work` and `WorkExperience`, or the intent behind the changes on both sides, it's challenging to definitively resolve this conflict.

Let's preserve the original snippet and return it as is, in markdown code syntax, since we cannot be certain of the intent:

```java

  @Facebook
  private List<UserDevice> devices = new ArrayList<UserDevice>();

  @Facebook
