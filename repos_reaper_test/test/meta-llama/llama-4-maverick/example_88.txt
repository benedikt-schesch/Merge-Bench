To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a web application, likely handling an AJAX request. The surrounding context indicates that it's loading a `CardSet` based on an ID provided in the request and is also handling password-related logic.

The conflict arises between two commits:
1. The local (`HEAD`) commit that has modified the code to parse an integer value from a request parameter named `BLANKS_LIMIT` and store it in `blanksLimit`.
2. The incoming commit (`d03dac9db71fadc7ff2663477514f7d0d10b3d94`) that retrieves the current password of a `game` object and stores it in `oldPassword`.

Let's examine the intent and semantics:
- The `HEAD` side is focused on retrieving a limit for "blanks" from the request, suggesting that the application is handling some form of input or configuration related to "blanks" ( possibly related to card games or a similar context).
- The incoming commit is concerned with obtaining the current password of the `game`, implying that the application is about to perform some operation that involves checking or changing the password.

To resolve this conflict, we must consider whether these changes are orthogonal (i.e., unrelated) or if there's a semantic connection between them.

Given that one change is related to handling a "blanks limit" and the other to retrieving the current password, these appear to be distinct functionalities. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that both changes are intended to be part of the final code, as they serve different purposes.

The resolution involves combining these changes in a way that respects both intents. Thus, the resolved code should include both the retrieval of `blanksLimit` and `oldPassword`.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
          if (!cardSetId.isEmpty()) {
            cardSets.add((CardSet) game.getHibernateSession().load(CardSet.class,
                Integer.parseInt(cardSetId)));
          }
        }
        final int blanksLimit = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(AjaxRequest.BLANKS_LIMIT));
        final String oldPassword = game.getPassword();
        String password = request.getParameter(AjaxRequest.PASSWORD);
        if (password == null) {
          password = "";
        }
        // We're not directly assigning this with Boolean.valueOf() because we want to default to
```
