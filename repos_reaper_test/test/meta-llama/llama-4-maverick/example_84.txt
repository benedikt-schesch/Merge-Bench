To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles formatting for card text, either for a custom card set or for Cardcast (a service related to Cards Against Humanity). The method `formatWhiteCard` takes a `JSONArray` as input and is intended to process its elements.

The conflict arises in the initialization of an `ArrayList` named `strs`. The size of this list is being set based on the `textParts` `JSONArray`. On one side of the merge (`HEAD`), the size is set using `textParts.size()`, while on the other side (`5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a`), it's set using `textParts.length()`.

Let's analyze the intent and semantics:

1. **JSONArray's size vs. length**: In many JSON libraries (like org.json), `JSONArray` has a `length()` method to get the number of elements it contains. The use of `size()` is more commonly associated with Java collections. The change from `size()` to `length()` suggests a potential difference in the JSON library being used or its version.

2. **Semantic Intent**: The intent is to pre-size the `ArrayList` to avoid resizing during the addition of elements, which can improve performance. Both sides are trying to achieve this, but they differ in how they determine the initial size.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand which `JSONArray` implementation is being used and whether it supports `size()` or `length()`. 

Given that `JSONArray` typically has a `length()` method in popular JSON handling libraries for Java, and considering that one side of the conflict uses `length()` while the other uses `size()`, the most likely resolution is to use `length()` if the JSONArray implementation supports it, as it is more conventional.

However, without knowing the specific JSONArray implementation or library version being used in the project (since it could be different and might support `size()`), it's safer to inspect the project's dependencies and JSONArray implementation.

For the purpose of this task, let's proceed under the assumption that the JSONArray implementation used here supports `length()`, as indicated by one side of the conflict.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml11(text);
  }

  public static String formatWhiteCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // The white cards should only ever have one element in text, but let's be safe.
    final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());
    for (final Object o : textParts) {
      final String cardCastString = (String) o;
      if (cardCastString.isEmpty()) {
        // skip blank segments
        continue;
```
