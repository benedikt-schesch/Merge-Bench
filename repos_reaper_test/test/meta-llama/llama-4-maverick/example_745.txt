To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a method that adds and configures a widget within a layout or container, adjusting its position and updating the total height accordingly.

The conflict arises between two commits (or branches) where the lines within the conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c`) differ.

1. The change on the left side of the conflict (`HEAD`) is: `// position it properly`
2. The change on the right side of the conflict (`c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c`) is: `// Position it properly`

The difference is merely a matter of capitalization: "position" vs. "Position". Both comments convey the same intent, which is to explain that the following lines of code are used to correctly position the widget.

Since the semantic intent behind both comments is identical and the difference is purely stylistic (capitalization), we can resolve this conflict by choosing one version over the other. For consistency and adherence to typical comment styling (starting with a capital letter), we could opt for the version on the right side (`// Position it properly`).

However, to follow the instructions precisely and given that the task is to return the entire snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context, and considering the intent is clear and the difference is minor, the resolution should directly reflect the chosen resolution.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
        mOpenWidgets.add(widget);

        // Make sure the widget is properly oriented
        widget.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientation, true);

        // Position it properly
        widget.forceFinalY(mTotalHeight - WIDGETS_MARGIN);
        widget.setY(mTotalHeight - WIDGETS_MARGIN);
        mTotalHeight += widget.getMeasuredHeight() + mSpacing;
    }

```

Presented in the required markdown code block format, the resolved snippet remains as is because the context and spacing are preserved.

```java
        mOpenWidgets.add(widget);

        // Make sure the widget is properly oriented
        widget.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientation, true);

        // Position it properly
        widget.forceFinalY(mTotalHeight - WIDGETS_MARGIN);
        widget.setY(mTotalHeight - WIDGETS_MARGIN);
        mTotalHeight += widget.getMeasuredHeight() + mSpacing;
    }
