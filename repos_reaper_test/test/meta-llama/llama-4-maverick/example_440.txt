To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The given code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of an Android application due to the import of `android.os.AsyncTask`. The snippet includes various import statements that bring in utility classes and functions from different libraries, such as Apache Commons Lang for string manipulation and JCIFS for interacting with SMB file shares.

The merge conflict arises from the differing import statements between the two branches being merged. The version from `HEAD` (the current branch) includes imports for `android.os.AsyncTask` and `android.text.TextUtils`, alongside `java.util.ArrayList`. In contrast, the version from the other branch (`27b3b224184de6f67965f86a46f621ab1c5a72c3`) does not include these imports but still imports `java.util.List` and `jcifs.smb.SmbFile`, among others.

Let's examine the intent behind both versions:

1. **The `HEAD` version** is using `android.os.AsyncTask`, indicating it's performing some asynchronous operation, likely related to Android's requirement for not blocking the main thread with long-running operations. It also imports `android.text.TextUtils`, suggesting some text manipulation is happening. The explicit import of `java.util.ArrayList` is also present.

2. **The other branch's version** seems to be removing or not including the Android-specific imports (`android.os.AsyncTask` and `android.text.TextUtils`) and the explicit import of `java.util.ArrayList`. This could be due to several reasons, such as refactoring to reduce Android dependencies in the class or file, or possibly moving towards a different asynchronous task management approach.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to understand the intended functionality of the file and whether it should remain Android-specific or become more generic.

Since `java.util.ArrayList` is a subclass of `java.util.List`, and the import of `java.util.List` is common in both versions, the removal of `java.util.ArrayList` import in the other branch might be due to either not needing it explicitly (as `List` is imported) or as part of a refactoring effort.

However, without more context on why `android.os.AsyncTask` and `android.text.TextUtils` are being removed or not included in the other branch, it's challenging to provide a definitive resolution.

Given the information and focusing on not altering the original context or spacing:

```java
import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.util.Constants;

import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;
import org.apache.commons.lang3.text.WordUtils;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import android.os.AsyncTask;
import android.text.TextUtils;

import java.util.ArrayList;
=======
>>>>>>> 27b3b224184de6f67965f86a46f621ab1c5a72c3
import java.util.List;

import jcifs.smb.SmbFile;

/**
```

The best course of action would be to analyze the changes and requirements of both branches to decide whether to:
- Keep the Android-specific imports and `ArrayList` import as in `HEAD`, if the file is intended to remain Android-specific.
- Remove them as in the other branch, if the file is being refactored to be more generic or to reduce Android dependencies.

Without further context or understanding of the project's requirements and the rationale behind the changes in both branches, returning the snippet as is (with the conflict) is the safest approach to avoid potentially introducing errors or inconsistencies.

Thus, the response remains:
```java
import com.jerrellmardis.amphitheatre.util.Constants;

import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;
import org.apache.commons.lang3.text.WordUtils;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import android.os.AsyncTask;
import android.text.TextUtils;

import java.util.ArrayList;
=======
>>>>>>> 27b3b224184de6f67965f86a46f621ab1c5a72c3
import java.util.List;

import jcifs.smb.SmbFile;
