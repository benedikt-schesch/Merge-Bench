To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a larger project related to Apache Pig, a high-level data processing language and framework. The conflict arises from different import statements being used in the two versions being merged.

On one side (`HEAD`), the code imports `LitePackager` from `org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators`. On the other side (`88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`), it imports `Packager` from the same package.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind using `LitePackager` versus `Packager`. 

1. **Understanding `LitePackager` and `Packager`**: 
   - `LitePackager` and `Packager` are both related to the packaging of data in the context of Pig's relational operators. 
   - Without specific details on their implementation and usage, we can infer that they might serve similar purposes but could have different implementations or optimizations.

2. **Analyzing the Intent**:
   - The use of `LitePackager` in `HEAD` suggests that the developer intended to use a potentially more lightweight or optimized version of the packager.
   - The use of `Packager` in the other branch (`88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) indicates an intent to use the standard or default packager.

3. **Resolving the Conflict**:
   - To resolve the conflict, we need to decide whether `LitePackager` or `Packager` is the appropriate choice for the current development intent.
   - If both versions are maintained and have different use cases, the correct choice depends on the specific requirements of the code.

However, without further context on how these import statements are used in the code or the specific requirements of the project, it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict.

Given the information and the fact that the rest of the code (beyond the import statements and the conflict markers) is not provided, the safest approach is to return the snippet as is, with the conflict markers, to preserve the original context and intent.
