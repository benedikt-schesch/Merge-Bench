To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code is calculating the size of the RPC header for an HBase client. The header includes several components:
1. Payload size (4 bytes)
2. RPC ID (4 bytes)
3. Length of the method name (2 bytes)
4. The method name (N bytes)

The conflict arises in the line where the size of the method name is being calculated.

On the `HEAD` side, the code uses `method.length`, suggesting that it is directly using the length of a variable or field named `method`.

On the `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` side, the code uses `method(server_version).length`, implying that `method` is a method (function) that takes `server_version` as an argument and returns a value whose length is being used.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind these changes.

1. If the intent is to directly use a field or variable named `method` and its length is what's needed, then the `HEAD` side is correct.
2. If the intent is to call a method named `method` with `server_version` as an argument and use the length of its return value, then the other side is correct.

Given the context, it seems that the change made on the `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` side is to dynamically determine the method name based on the `server_version`. This could be for handling different versions of the HBase server where the method name might differ.

Without more context about what `method` and `server_version` represent, it's reasonable to assume that both changes have valid intents. However, the correct resolution depends on understanding whether the method name should be dynamically determined based on `server_version` or if it should be statically determined as implied by the `HEAD` side.

Given the information and analyzing the semantics:
- If `method` is a field or variable and its length is directly needed, `HEAD` is correct.
- If `method` is supposed to be a function that returns different method names based on `server_version`, then `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` is correct.

Let's assume the change on `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` is intentional and is trying to achieve something that `HEAD` does not. Therefore, choosing the change that introduces the method call `method(server_version)` seems reasonable if we believe the method name needs to be determined based on the server version.

However, to be cautious and follow instructions precisely without assuming more context than given:
