To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the changes introduced on both sides of the merge.

On the `HEAD` side (the local changes), we have a constructor for `PreferencesDialog` that is annotated with `@Inject`, indicating it's likely being used in a dependency injection framework. The constructor takes four parameters: `pingerRegistry`, `globalConfig`, `scannerConfig`, and `guiConfig`.

On the other side of the merge (`90b95dd53d88e33bb1dd393eab78bae4f6ab5b14`), two changes are made:
1. The `languages` array is updated to include `"tr"`, suggesting the addition of support for Turkish.
2. The constructor for `PreferencesDialog` is modified to take an additional parameter, `configDetectorDialog`, and the `@Inject` annotation is removed.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both sets of changes. The `HEAD` side is focused on dependency injection with a specific set of constructor parameters. The other side introduces a new language and modifies the constructor to accept an additional parameter, potentially changing how `PreferencesDialog` is instantiated or used.

Given the changes, it appears that both sides are achieving different but potentially complementary goals. The addition of a new language is straightforward and doesn't conflict with the dependency injection mechanism. However, the modification to the constructor parameters and the removal of the `@Inject` annotation on the other side could indicate a shift away from or a change in how dependency injection is being used for `PreferencesDialog`.

To preserve the intent of both sides where possible, we can:
- Include the new language ("tr") in the `languages` array, as it doesn't conflict with any changes on the `HEAD` side.
- Decide on the constructor's parameters and annotation based on the intent. If the `@Inject` annotation is being removed because dependency injection is no longer being used or is being used differently for `PreferencesDialog`, then we should also remove it and include the new parameter `configDetectorDialog`.

Here's the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
	private Text notScannedText;
	private Button[] displayMethod;
	private Button showInfoCheckbox;
	private Button askConfirmationCheckbox;
	private Combo languageCombo;
	private String[] languages = { "system", "en", "hu", "lt", "es", "ku", "tr" };

	public PreferencesDialog(PingerRegistry pingerRegistry, Config globalConfig, ScannerConfig scannerConfig, GUIConfig guiConfig, ConfigDetectorDialog configDetectorDialog) {
		this.pingerRegistry = pingerRegistry;
		this.globalConfig = globalConfig;
		this.scannerConfig = scannerConfig;
		this.guiConfig = guiConfig;
	}
```

This resolution includes the Turkish language in the `languages` array and adopts the modified constructor from the other side of the merge, removing the `@Inject` annotation and adding the `configDetectorDialog` parameter. This assumes that the changes on both sides are intended to be part of the final version of `PreferencesDialog`. If the intent is ambiguous or if there's a reason to believe that the `@Inject` annotation should be retained (e.g., if dependency injection is still being used), further clarification would be needed to resolve the conflict accurately.
