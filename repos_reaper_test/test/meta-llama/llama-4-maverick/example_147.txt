To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class for Apache Pig, a high-level data processing language and framework. The snippet involves registering Pig queries and checking the accumulator property.

The conflict arises from the modification of the `PigConfiguration.OPT_ACCUMULATOR` property. The two versions of the code are:

1. `pigServer.getPigContext().getProperties().setProperty(PigConfiguration.OPT_ACCUMULATOR, "true");`
2. `pigServer.getPigContext().getProperties().setProperty("opt.accumulator", "true");`

Let's examine the intent behind each change:

1. The first change uses `PigConfiguration.OPT_ACCUMULATOR` as the key. This suggests that the code is relying on a predefined constant for the accumulator configuration property. Using a constant typically helps in avoiding typos and ensures consistency across the codebase.

2. The second change directly uses the string `"opt.accumulator"` as the key. This could be seen as either a more direct approach or potentially a less maintainable one if the property key changes in the future, as it hardcodes the property name.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the semantics and intent behind `PigConfiguration.OPT_ACCUMULATOR` and `"opt.accumulator"`. 

After investigation, it appears that `PigConfiguration.OPT_ACCUMULATOR` is the correct constant to use for setting the accumulator property. The value of `PigConfiguration.OPT_ACCUMULATOR` is indeed `"opt.accumulator"`, but using the constant is generally better practice as it is less prone to typos and is more maintainable.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to use the version that sets the property using `PigConfiguration.OPT_ACCUMULATOR`.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
        pigServer.registerQuery("B = group A by id;");
        pigServer.registerQuery("C = foreach B generate group," +
                "org.apache.pig.test.utils.AccumulativeSumBag(A);");

        checkAccumulatorOff("C");
        pigServer.getPigContext().getProperties().setProperty(
                PigConfiguration.OPT_ACCUMULATOR, "true");

    }

    private void checkAccumulatorOff(String alias) {
        try {
            Iterator<Tuple> iter = pigServer.openIterator(alias);
```
