To resolve the given merge conflict, we need to understand the changes made on both sides of the merge and determine the intent behind these changes.

The conflict arises from the import statement for `ExecType`. The local changes (`HEAD`) have it as `org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType`, while the incoming changes (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) have it as `org.apache.pig.ExecType`.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Understanding the imports**: The code is importing various classes from `org.apache.log4j` for logging and several classes from `org.apache.pig` and its subpackages for Pig-related functionality.

2. **Analyzing the conflict**: The conflict is specifically about how `ExecType` is being imported. `ExecType` is an enumeration in Pig that specifies the execution type (e.g., MAPREDUCE, LOCAL).

3. **Historical context and Pig API changes**: In older versions of Pig, `ExecType` was located under `PigServer`. However, it has been moved directly under the `org.apache.pig` package in later versions. This change suggests that the incoming changes are likely from a more recent version of Pig or a codebase that has been updated to use the newer Pig API.

4. **Resolving the conflict**: To resolve this, we need to decide which version is more appropriate or if both can be reconciled. If the rest of the codebase is using the newer Pig API (importing classes directly from `org.apache.pig`), it's likely that the correct resolution is to use `org.apache.pig.ExecType`. However, if the project is still using an older version of Pig where `ExecType` is under `PigServer`, then `org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType` is correct.

Without more context about the Pig version being used or the broader changes in the codebase, the safest resolution is to choose one that is likely to be compatible with the rest of the code. However, the instructions require returning the snippet as is if the intent is ambiguous.

Given the information and following the instructions to not modify the context and to return the snippet in markdown code syntax as provided, the conflict resolution may not be straightforward without additional context. Therefore, the resolution will be to return the snippet as is.
