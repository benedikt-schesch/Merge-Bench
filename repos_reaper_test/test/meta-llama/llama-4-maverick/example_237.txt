To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The original code snippet before the merge conflict would have looked something like this:
```java
static public File createInputFile(String tmpFilenamePrefix, 
                                   String tmpFilenameSuffix, 
                                   String[] inputData) 
throws IOException {
    File f = File.createTempFile(tmpFilenamePrefix, tmpFilenameSuffix);
    PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(f);
    for (int i=0; i<inputData.length; i++){
        pw.println(inputData[i]);
    }
    pw.close();
    return f;
}
```

The changes on the `HEAD` side (the local changes) are not introducing any new code relative to the conflicting section; they are maintaining the original `PrintWriter` initialization.

The changes on the `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` side (the changes being merged in) introduce two significant changes:
1. The file `f` is marked for deletion on exit with `f.deleteOnExit();`. This ensures that the temporary file is deleted when the JVM exits, which is a good practice for temporary files to avoid cluttering the file system.
2. The `PrintWriter` is initialized with a specific encoding ("UTF-8") using `new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(f), "UTF-8"))`. This change ensures that the data written to the file is encoded in UTF-8, which is crucial for correctly handling strings that may contain non-ASCII characters.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent and semantics of both changes. The `HEAD` side does not introduce any changes in the conflicting area, suggesting that it either didn't modify this part of the code or the modifications were not conflicting in terms of lines changed. The incoming changes (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) improve the handling of temporary files and ensure proper encoding.

Given that both changes are not directly conflicting in terms of functionality (one is about file handling and the other about encoding), and assuming that the intent is to both ensure the file is deleted on exit and to use UTF-8 encoding, the resolution should incorporate both changes.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
	static public File createInputFile(String tmpFilenamePrefix, 
			                           String tmpFilenameSuffix, 
			                           String[] inputData) 
	throws IOException {
		File f = File.createTempFile(tmpFilenamePrefix, tmpFilenameSuffix);
		f.deleteOnExit();
		PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(f), "UTF-8"));
		for (int i=0; i<inputData.length; i++){
			pw.println(inputData[i]);
		}
		pw.close();
		return f;
```
