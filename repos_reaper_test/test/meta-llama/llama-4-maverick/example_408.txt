To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a Java test class for JBake, a static site generator. The conflict arises from the import statements, where the local (`HEAD`) version has an import for `org.jbake.model.DocumentModel` and `org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty`, while the incoming change (`d68ddea7554653e7928d220f57a3af13bfb30cdb`) removes `org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty` and `org.jbake.model.DocumentModel` (not directly, but the removal is implied as it's not present) and instead imports `org.jbake.app.configuration.PropertyList`.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both sets of changes.

1. **Understanding the Local Changes (`HEAD`):** The local changes include an import for `DocumentModel` and `JBakeProperty`. This suggests that the test class might be using these classes for its tests, possibly for testing document models or properties related to JBake configurations.

2. **Understanding the Incoming Changes (`d68ddea...`):** The incoming changes remove the reference to `JBakeProperty` and `DocumentModel` (by not importing them) and introduce `PropertyList`. This could indicate a refactoring where `JBakeProperty` has been replaced or is being replaced by `PropertyList`, or that the tests are being updated to use `PropertyList` for configuration or property handling.

Given this information, we need to decide how to merge these changes.

- If `JBakeProperty` has been deprecated or replaced by `PropertyList`, and `DocumentModel` is still in use, we would keep the import for `DocumentModel` and replace `JBakeProperty` with `PropertyList`.
- If `DocumentModel` is no longer needed or has been moved/refactored, and `PropertyList` is the new standard for handling properties, we might remove `DocumentModel` and keep `PropertyList`.

However, without the actual code that uses these imports, it's challenging to make a definitive decision.

Let's examine the possibilities:

1. **Both `DocumentModel` and `PropertyList` are needed:** In this case, we would keep both imports.
2. **`DocumentModel` is not needed, and `PropertyList` is the new standard:** Here, we would remove `DocumentModel` and `JBakeProperty`, keeping `PropertyList`.

Since we cannot see the usage of these classes within the test class and cannot be certain about the intent, a safe resolution would be to keep both `DocumentModel` (from `HEAD`) and `PropertyList` (from the incoming change), assuming both are necessary for the test class. However, `JBakeProperty` seems to be replaced by `PropertyList` based on the changes.

Let's resolve the conflict by keeping both necessary imports, assuming that's the intent.

```java
package org.jbake.app;

import org.jbake.TestUtils;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.ConfigUtil;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.DefaultJBakeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.PropertyList;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.rules.TemporaryFolder;
```

Here is the response in the required markdown code syntax:

```java
package org.jbake.app;

import org.jbake.TestUtils;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.ConfigUtil;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.DefaultJBakeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.PropertyList;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.rules.TemporaryFolder;
