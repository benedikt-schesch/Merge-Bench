To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The given Java code snippet appears to be part of a method or a block that initializes or updates a collection of licenses (`sLicenses`). The licenses being registered are all instances of different license classes (e.g., `ApacheSoftwareLicense20`, `BSD3ClauseLicense`, etc.), suggesting that the code is managing a list or set of software licenses.

On one side of the merge (`HEAD`), a `GnuLesserGeneralPublicLicense21` is being registered. On the other side (`79c0b6004ae455f981819e1301f023c4a05fe19d`), a `CreativeCommonsAttributionNoDerivs30Unported` license is being registered.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. Are these licenses being added as part of a larger set of changes where both are relevant? Or is there a specific reason one is being added over the other?

Given the information and without additional context, both licenses seem relevant in different contexts:
- `GnuLesserGeneralPublicLicense21` is a software license, often used for libraries, indicating its relevance in a software development context.
- `CreativeCommonsAttributionNoDerivs30Unported` is a Creative Commons license, typically used for creative works rather than software, allowing attribution but prohibiting derivatives.

Since both licenses serve different purposes and are used in different contexts, it's plausible that both are intended to be registered. 

The resolution involves deciding whether both licenses should be included or if one takes precedence over the other based on the intent. Without explicit information on why one was chosen over the other or if there's a specific requirement for one type of license over the other, the simplest semantic resolution would be to include both licenses, as they seem to serve different purposes.

Thus, the resolved code snippet, preserving the original context and spacing, would be:

```java
        sLicenses.clear();
        registerLicense(new ApacheSoftwareLicense20());
        registerLicense(new BSD3ClauseLicense());
        registerLicense(new ISCLicense());
        registerLicense(new MITLicense());
        registerLicense(new GnuLesserGeneralPublicLicense21());
        registerLicense(new CreativeCommonsAttributionNoDerivs30Unported());
    }

    /**
     * Register an additional license.
     */
```
