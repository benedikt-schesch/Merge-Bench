To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes both sides are trying to introduce.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a test suite, judging by the presence of `@Test` annotations. The tests seem to be verifying the serialization of certain objects (`ListObject` and `MapObject`) to JSON using a custom `createJsonMapper().toJson()` method.

The conflict arises between two commits or branches: `HEAD` and `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`. The `HEAD` side contains an additional test method `emptyFacebookMap()` that tests the serialization of a `MapObject` instance. On the other hand, the `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` side does not have this test method and instead seems to be removing or not including it.

Let's analyze the intent:

1. The `HEAD` side is adding a test for `MapObject` serialization, which implies that the serialization behavior of `MapObject` is being tested or verified.
2. The other side (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) is not including this test, which could mean that either this test is not necessary or it was removed for a reason (like a refactor or a change in testing strategy).

To resolve the conflict, we need to decide whether the `emptyFacebookMap()` test is relevant and should be kept.

Upon closer inspection, the test `emptyFacebookMap()` seems to be testing the serialization of an empty `MapObject` to JSON. The expected JSON output is `{"id":12345}`, which is the same as in the test for `ListObject`. This could indicate that both tests are verifying some common serialization behavior or a specific characteristic of these objects when empty.

However, without knowing the specifics of `ListObject`, `MapObject`, and their expected serialization behavior, it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict based solely on the given snippet.

Since the intent behind including or excluding `emptyFacebookMap()` isn't entirely clear from the context provided, and assuming both sides have valid reasons for their state, the safest approach would be to preserve the test if it is deemed relevant.

Given the information and sticking strictly to the instructions:

```java
    ListObject obj = new ListObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }

  @Test
  public void emptyFacebookMap() {
    MapObject obj = new MapObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }

  /**
   * Can we handle the empty object?
   */
  @Test
  public void emptyObject() {
```
