To resolve the merge conflict in the given Java code snippet, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is part of a class that appears to handle data related to a profile picture, among other things. It involves processing a `rawPicture` object to extract a JSON representation of a picture, which is then mapped to a `ProfilePictureSource` object using a `jsonMapper`.

The conflict arises in the line where `picJson` is assigned a value. The two versions of the code are:
1. `String picJson = rawPicture.get("data").toString();` (from `HEAD`)
2. `String picJson = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString();` (from `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`)

Let's examine the intent behind both changes:

1. The version from `HEAD` simply retrieves the value associated with the key `"data"` from `rawPicture` and calls `toString()` on it. This assumes that the value associated with `"data"` is either already a string or can be meaningfully converted to one. If `"data"` maps to a complex object (like a `JsonObject`), this might not produce the desired JSON string representation.

2. The version from `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` retrieves the value associated with `"data"` as a `JsonObject` and then calls `toString()` on this object. This is a more specific operation that assumes the value associated with `"data"` is a JSON object. Calling `toString()` on a `JsonObject` typically produces a JSON string representation of the object, which is likely the intent here.

Considering the semantics and intent:
- If `rawPicture.get("data")` returns a `JsonObject`, then the second version (`rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString()`) is more appropriate because it explicitly handles the case where `"data"` maps to a JSON object, ensuring that `picJson` is a valid JSON string representation of that object.
- The first version could potentially work if `rawPicture.get("data").toString()` also produces a valid JSON string. However, this is less explicit and might not always yield the expected result, especially if the object is not a `JsonObject` or if its `toString()` method does not produce a JSON representation.

Given that both versions are trying to achieve a similar goal (getting a JSON string representation of the `"data"`), but the second version is more explicit and safer in terms of handling JSON objects, the resolution could lean towards the second version if we assume that `"data"` is expected to be a JSON object.

However, without more context about the type of `rawPicture` and the expected structure of the data it contains, it's difficult to definitively resolve the conflict based solely on the information given.

Given the provided information and focusing on preserving the original context and spacing, the original snippet with the conflict is returned as is, in markdown code syntax:

```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

<<<<<<< HEAD
    String picJson = rawPicture.get("data").toString();
=======
    String picJson = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString();
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    picture = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(picJson, ProfilePictureSource.class);
  }
