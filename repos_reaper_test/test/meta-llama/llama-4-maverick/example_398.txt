To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The snippet is a Java import statement section from a class that appears to be part of an IntelliJ IDEA plugin, specifically related to Infinitest, a continuous testing tool. The merge conflict occurs because the `HEAD` (the current branch being merged into) and the commit `b233cd4cf01f6acf2619f7ccd68001c34e74a6b4` (the branch being merged) have both made changes to the import statements.

Looking at the conflict:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import com.intellij.execution.CommonProgramRunConfigurationParameters;
import com.intellij.execution.util.ProgramParametersConfigurator;
import com.intellij.ide.plugins.IdeaPluginDescriptor;
>>>>>>> b233cd4cf01f6acf2619f7ccd68001c34e74a6b4
```

The `HEAD` side does not have any additional imports in this section, while the other side (`b233cd4cf01f6acf2619f7ccd68001c34e74a6b4`) introduces three new imports:

1. `com.intellij.execution.CommonProgramRunConfigurationParameters`
2. `com.intellij.execution.util.ProgramParametersConfigurator`
3. `com.intellij.ide.plugins.IdeaPluginDescriptor`

These imports suggest that the changes from `b233cd4cf01f6acf2619f7ccd68001c34e74a6b4` are adding functionality related to program run configurations and possibly interacting with or manipulating plugin descriptors.

The existing imports in both versions include classes and interfaces related to the Infinitest plugin for IntelliJ, compiler paths, logging, and module management.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider whether the changes from both sides are necessary and how they integrate with the overall functionality of the class.

1. The imports from `HEAD` are already included in the merged version below the conflict, so there's no loss of existing imports.
2. The new imports from `b233cd4cf01f6acf2619f7ccd68001c34e74a6b4` introduce new functionality or classes that are not present in `HEAD`.

Since there's no indication that the new imports conflict with the existing code or imports semantically, and assuming that the class now or in the future requires the functionality provided by these new imports, we can resolve the conflict by keeping all the imports.

The resolved snippet, preserving the original spacing and context, is:

```java
import org.infinitest.environment.RuntimeEnvironment;
import org.infinitest.intellij.InfinitestJarsLocator;
import org.infinitest.intellij.ModuleSettings;
import org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable;

import com.intellij.execution.CommonProgramRunConfigurationParameters;
import com.intellij.execution.util.ProgramParametersConfigurator;
import com.intellij.ide.plugins.IdeaPluginDescriptor;
import com.intellij.ide.plugins.PluginManager;
import com.intellij.openapi.compiler.CompilerPaths;
import com.intellij.openapi.diagnostic.Logger;
import com.intellij.openapi.extensions.PluginDescriptor;
import com.intellij.openapi.module.Module;
```

Thus, the response in markdown code syntax is:
```java
import org.infinitest.environment.RuntimeEnvironment;
import org.infinitest.intellij.InfinitestJarsLocator;
import org.infinitest.intellij.ModuleSettings;
import org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable;

import com.intellij.execution.CommonProgramRunConfigurationParameters;
import com.intellij.execution.util.ProgramParametersConfigurator;
import com.intellij.ide.plugins.IdeaPluginDescriptor;
import com.intellij.ide.plugins.PluginManager;
import com.intellij.openapi.compiler.CompilerPaths;
import com.intellij.openapi.diagnostic.Logger;
import com.intellij.openapi.extensions.PluginDescriptor;
import com.intellij.openapi.module.Module;
