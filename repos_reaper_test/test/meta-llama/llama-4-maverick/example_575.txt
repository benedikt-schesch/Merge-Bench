To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a method that converts a raw value into a specific type based on the provided `type` parameter. The method seems to be handling JSON data, given the presence of `jsonHelper` and methods like `getStringFrom` and `getIntegerFrom`.

The conflict arises in the lines related to converting the `rawValue` to a `String`. The `HEAD` version (the local version being merged) uses `jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue)`, while the version being merged (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) uses `rawValue.toString()`.

Let's consider the intent behind both approaches:

1. **`jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue)`**: This suggests that there's a specific helper method (`getStringFrom`) designed to extract or convert `rawValue` into a `String`. This method might handle specific cases or nuances related to JSON data conversion, potentially including error handling or special formatting.

2. **`rawValue.toString()`**: This directly calls the `toString()` method on `rawValue`. The behavior of `toString()` depends on the actual object `rawValue` is. For many objects, it provides a string representation, but this can vary greatly. For JSON objects or primitives wrapped in objects, this could yield a meaningful string. However, it might not be as sophisticated or JSON-aware as `jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue)`.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider what the overall intent of the method is and which approach better aligns with that intent.

Given that the surrounding code uses `jsonHelper` for type conversions (e.g., `getIntegerFrom`), it suggests that the method is designed to work with JSON data and potentially relies on `jsonHelper` for consistent handling of different data types. 

`jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue)` and `rawValue.toString()` can have different behaviors depending on what `rawValue` is. If `rawValue` is a JSON object or array, `rawValue.toString()` might not produce the expected JSON string representation but rather something like the object's identity or a default string representation. In contrast, a method like `jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue)` is likely designed to handle such cases appropriately for JSON.

Without knowing the exact behavior of `jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue)` and the expected outcome, the safer choice seems to be sticking with the approach that is consistent with the rest of the method's logic, which utilizes `jsonHelper`.

However, the comment above the conflicting lines warns about turning "anything into a string," which implies that the code is aware of potential unexpected results. Both `jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue)` and `rawValue.toString()` could potentially lead to such results, but in different ways.

Given the information and focusing on the intent and semantics:

```java
       * This is useful if, for example, you've got a @Facebook-annotated string field that you'd like to have a numeric
       * type shoved into.
       *
       * User beware: this will turn *anything* into a string, which might lead to results you don't expect.
