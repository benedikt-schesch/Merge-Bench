To resolve this merge conflict, let's examine the code snippet and understand the context and intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The given snippet is in Java and appears to be part of an Android application, given the import statements that include Android-specific classes.

The conflict arises from the fact that the `HEAD` version (typically the local version or the version being merged into) includes an import statement for `android.content.SharedPreferences`, while the version being merged (`308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5`) does not have this import statement.

Let's analyze the intent:

1. **Import Statement for `SharedPreferences`**: The import statement for `SharedPreferences` is included in the `HEAD` version. This suggests that somewhere in the code (not shown in the snippet), `SharedPreferences` is being used. The use of `SharedPreferences` typically implies that the application is storing or retrieving some form of preference or setting.

2. **Removal of `SharedPreferences` Import**: The version being merged (`308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5`) removes the import statement for `SharedPreferences`. This could imply one of several things:
   - The code that was using `SharedPreferences` has been removed or refactored to not use it.
   - The merge commit (`308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5`) might be part of a larger refactor or cleanup effort.

However, without seeing the actual code changes related to `SharedPreferences`, it's challenging to definitively say why the import is being removed.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider whether `SharedPreferences` is actually being used in the code. 

Since we can't see the rest of the code, the resolution depends on whether the `SharedPreferences` import is necessary. If it is used, removing it would cause a compilation error. If it's not used, it's unnecessary and could be safely removed.

Given the information and the principle of not modifying the context or spacing:

```java
import android.app.FragmentManager;
import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.IntentFilter;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import android.content.SharedPreferences;
=======
>>>>>>> 308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.graphics.drawable.Drawable;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.os.Handler;
import android.preference.PreferenceManager;
```

Should be analyzed for `SharedPreferences` usage. 

If `SharedPreferences` is used elsewhere in the code, the correct resolution would be to keep the import statement.

Let's assume it's used (since we can't verify), the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context, should be:

```java
import android.app.FragmentManager;
import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.IntentFilter;
import android.content.SharedPreferences;
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.graphics.drawable.Drawable;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.os.Handler;
import android.preference.PreferenceManager;
```

Thus, the conflict is resolved by keeping the `SharedPreferences` import, assuming it's necessary based on its presence in the `HEAD` version and the potential for its use elsewhere in the codebase. 

The final answer is:
```java
import android.app.FragmentManager;
import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.IntentFilter;
import android.content.SharedPreferences;
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.graphics.drawable.Drawable;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.os.Handler;
import android.preference.PreferenceManager;
```
