To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a larger method or class involved in processing or packaging data, possibly in the context of a database or data processing pipeline. The specific details of the class and method are not provided, but we can infer some information from the given snippet.

The conflict arises between the lines `int total = current - initial;` and the declaration of `MultiQueryPackager toPkgr`. The changes on both sides of the conflict (HEAD and 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a) need to be examined.

On the `HEAD` side, there are no additional lines or modifications immediately after `int total = current - initial;`, just a blank line.

On the `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a` side, a blank line is also introduced after `int total = current - initial;`, which is essentially the same as the change on the `HEAD` side - just a blank line.

Given that both sides introduce a blank line (or essentially do nothing different in terms of code logic), the conflict is not about resolving different logical changes but rather about the presence of a blank line.

To resolve this, we can simply accept either side's change (or both, as they are effectively the same), and the resulting code should be syntactically and semantically the same.

Here is the resolution:

```java
            // with the new indexed key
            addShiftedKeyInfoIndex(initial, fromPkgr);
        }

        int total = current - initial;
        
        MultiQueryPackager toPkgr = (MultiQueryPackager) ((POPackage) to
                .getRoots().get(0)).getPkgr();
        int pkCount = 0;
        if (fromPkgr instanceof MultiQueryPackager) {
            List<Packager> pkgs = ((MultiQueryPackager) fromPkgr)
```
