To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the provided code snippet and understand the context and intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The given code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that implements a visitor pattern for physical plans or operators in a data processing system (likely Apache Pig, given the class and method names like `POPackage`, `POForEach`, and `VisitorException`).

The conflict is in the `visitPackage` method, where one side of the merge (HEAD) has a blank line, and the other side (88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a) has a line with a single whitespace character or possibly nothing visible but implying some difference (though upon closer inspection, it seems like it might just be a blank line or an empty line with possibly different whitespace).

Let's break down the steps and thought process:

1. **Understand the context**: The code is part of a visitor implementation. The `visitPackage` method is currently a no-operation (no-op) as indicated by the comment `//do nothing`.

2. **Analyze the conflict**: The conflict arises from differences in blank lines or whitespace between the two versions being merged. The `HEAD` version has a blank line after the `visitPackage` method, and the other version (`88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) also appears to have some form of blank line or whitespace difference.

3. **Resolve based on intent and semantics**: Since both versions are essentially doing nothing differently regarding the `visitPackage` method's implementation, and the difference lies in whitespace or blank lines, we need to consider if the blank lines serve any semantic purpose or if they are simply formatting differences.

4. **Decision**: In Java, blank lines are used for readability and do not affect the compilation or runtime semantics. Both sides are maintaining the `visitPackage` method as a no-op. The difference is purely in formatting.

Given the information and analyzing the intent, the simplest resolution is to remove the conflict markers and decide on a single version of the code. However, since the difference is in whitespace and not in the logic, and to preserve the original formatting as closely as possible without modifying the context, we can simply remove the conflict markers.

Here's the resolution:
```java
    }

    public void visitPackage(POPackage pkg) throws VisitorException{
        //do nothing
    }

    public void visitPOForEach(POForEach nfe) throws VisitorException {
        List<PhysicalPlan> inpPlans = nfe.getInputPlans();
        for (PhysicalPlan plan : inpPlans) {
            pushWalker(mCurrentWalker.spawnChildWalker(plan));
            visit();
```
