To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a larger method that is merging or combining packaging information from one packager (`fromPkgr`) to another (`toPkgr`). Both `fromPkgr` and `toPkgr` are being cast to `MultiQueryPackager` at different points, suggesting that the method is designed to work with instances of this class.

The conflict arises in the line within the `for` loop:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
                ((MultiQueryPackager) fromPkgr).addPackager(p);
=======
                ((MultiQueryPackager) toPkgr).addPackager(p);
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a
```

Let's break down the intent behind each side:

1. **Left Side (`HEAD`):** `((MultiQueryPackager) fromPkgr).addPackager(p);`
   - This line is adding the packager `p` to `fromPkgr`, which is already being iterated upon to retrieve its packagers. This seems counterintuitive because `fromPkgr` is the source, and you're iterating over its packagers. Adding a packager back to itself doesn't seem to achieve a meaningful merge or transfer operation.

2. **Right Side (`88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`):** `((MultiQueryPackager) toPkgr).addPackager(p);`
   - This line adds the packager `p` to `toPkgr`, which is presumably the target where packagers are being merged or transferred to. This action aligns with the idea of taking packagers from `fromPkgr` and adding them to `toPkgr`, effectively merging or transferring packaging information.

After the loop, the code continues with operations on `toPkgr`, specifically adding a list of boolean values indicating whether keys are wrapped (`toPkgr.addIsKeyWrappedList(((MultiQueryPackager) fromPkgr).getIsKeyWrappedList());`) and then calling `addShiftedKeyInfoIndex(initial, current, ...)`. These operations further support the notion that the intent is to merge information from `fromPkgr` into `toPkgr`.

Given this analysis, the right side of the conflict (`((MultiQueryPackager) toPkgr).addPackager(p);`) is more semantically aligned with the overall intent of merging packaging information from `fromPkgr` to `toPkgr`.

Therefore, the resolved code snippet, without modifying the context and preserving the spacing, is:

```java
        int pkCount = 0;
        if (fromPkgr instanceof MultiQueryPackager) {
            List<Packager> pkgs = ((MultiQueryPackager) fromPkgr)
                    .getPackagers();
            for (Packager p : pkgs) {
                ((MultiQueryPackager) toPkgr).addPackager(p);
                pkCount++;
            }
            toPkgr.addIsKeyWrappedList(((MultiQueryPackager) fromPkgr)
                            .getIsKeyWrappedList());
            addShiftedKeyInfoIndex(initial, current,
```
