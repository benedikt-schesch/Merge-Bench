To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The conflict is centered around the `@Beta` annotation. The left side of the conflict (`HEAD`) includes the `@Beta` annotation, indicating that the method or class it's annotating is in a beta state, meaning it is not considered stable or final and might be changed or removed in the future. The right side of the conflict (the change being merged in) removes this annotation, suggesting that the method or class should be considered stable or that the beta status is being removed.

Given the context provided, the method `initSslContext` is being documented with detailed parameter descriptions, indicating its purpose is to initialize an `SSLContext`. The presence or absence of `@Beta` affects how consumers of this method perceive its stability.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind adding or removing the `@Beta` annotation. 

1. If the method is considered stable and ready for use without the beta designation, removing `@Beta` makes sense.
2. If the method is still experimental or subject to change, `@Beta` should be retained.

Without additional context about the project's release cycle, the history of this method, or specific decisions regarding its stability, the most straightforward resolution is to consider the semantic intent:

- If the change (removing `@Beta`) is intended to signify that `initSslContext` is now considered stable, it aligns with making the API more production-ready.
- If the presence of `@Beta` is crucial for signaling that `initSslContext` is still subject to change, then retaining it is necessary.

The provided snippet does not give enough information about the stability or intended use of `initSslContext`. However, since the change is simply removing `@Beta`, we can infer that the intent might be to mark the method as stable.

Therefore, resolving the conflict by removing the `@Beta` annotation (as the merge is doing) could be considered correct if the method is deemed stable. The resolution would look like this:
```java
   * @param mtlsKeyStore key store for client certificate and key to establish mutual TLS
   * @param mtlsKeyStorePassword password for mtlsKeyStore parameter
   * @param keyManagerFactory key manager factory (for example {@link
   *     #getDefaultKeyManagerFactory()})
   */
  public static SSLContext initSslContext(
      SSLContext sslContext,
      KeyStore trustStore,
      TrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory,
      KeyStore mtlsKeyStore,
```
However, to follow the instructions precisely and given that we are to return the entire snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context, the correct response should still be in the original markdown code format, and since we've decided on a resolution, we'll directly provide that.

```java
   * @param mtlsKeyStore key store for client certificate and key to establish mutual TLS
   * @param mtlsKeyStorePassword password for mtlsKeyStore parameter
   * @param keyManagerFactory key manager factory (for example {@link
   *     #getDefaultKeyManagerFactory()})
   */
  public static SSLContext initSslContext(
      SSLContext sslContext,
      KeyStore trustStore,
      TrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory,
      KeyStore mtlsKeyStore,
```
