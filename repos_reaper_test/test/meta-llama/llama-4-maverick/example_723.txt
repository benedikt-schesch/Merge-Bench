To resolve the merge conflict, let's analyze the context and intent behind the changes.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a method that saves application preferences using a `SharedPreferences.Editor` object. The preferences being saved include various settings such as blacklist and whitelist enablement, logging, battery level, and alert phone number.

The conflict arises between two commits that modify the preferences being saved. The local changes (HEAD) add a preference for "SmsReportDelivery", while the incoming changes (bc9125dc30f2833e4ac24ec01ecf1db7debbbf77) add a preference for "MessageResultsAPIEnable".

Upon closer inspection, it seems that both changes are adding a new preference, but they are unrelated to each other. "SmsReportDelivery" and "MessageResultsAPIEnable" appear to be distinct features or settings.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider whether both changes are necessary and should be preserved. Since they are unrelated, it's likely that both changes are intended to be part of the final code.

Here's the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:
```java
        editor.putBoolean("EnableBlacklist", enableBlacklist);
        editor.putBoolean("EnableWhitelist", enableWhitelist);
        editor.putBoolean("EnableLog", enableLog);
        editor.putInt("BatteryLevel", batteryLevel);
        editor.putString("AlertPhoneNumber", alertPhoneNumber);
        editor.putBoolean("SmsReportDelivery", smsReportDelivery);
        editor.putBoolean("MessageResultsAPIEnable", messageResultsAPIEnable);
        editor.commit();
    }
