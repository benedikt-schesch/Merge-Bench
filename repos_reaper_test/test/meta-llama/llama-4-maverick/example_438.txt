To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be a part of a class that defines various constants, specifically string constants that seem to be used for preference keys or action identifiers within an Android application.

On one side of the merge (represented by `HEAD`), two new constants have been added:
- `PALETTE_VISIBILITY`
- `PALETTE_VIBRANCY`

These constants seem to be related to the visibility and vibrancy of a palette, possibly in the context of a UI component or feature that involves color palettes or themes.

On the other side of the merge (represented by the commit `308db82053c3707c95c8a180e78ac06043dff2a5`), a new constant has been added:
- `LIBRARY_UPDATED_ACTION`

This constant appears to be related to an action that is broadcast or triggered when a library (potentially a media library within the application) is updated.

To resolve the conflict, we need to determine if both changes are intended to be part of the codebase. Given that the constants are distinct and do not appear to be related to the same specific feature or functionality (one relates to palette settings, and the other to a library update action), it is reasonable to assume that both changes are valid and should be preserved.

Therefore, the resolution involves including all the new constants introduced by both sides of the merge. The resolved code snippet will include `PALETTE_VISIBILITY`, `PALETTE_VIBRANCY`, and `LIBRARY_UPDATED_ACTION`.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java

    public static final String PREFS_USER_KEY = "user";
    public static final String PREFS_PASSWORD_KEY = "password";

    public static final String VIDEO_UPDATE_ACTION = "videoUpdateAction";
    public static final String LIBRARY_UPDATED_ACTION = "libraryUpdatedAction";
    public static final String PALETTE_VISIBILITY = "paletteVisibility";
    public static final String PALETTE_VIBRANCY = "paletteVibrancy";
}
```
