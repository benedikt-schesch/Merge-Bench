To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class named `DebugScreen`. The class has two member variables: `spoutMessages` and `messages`, both of which are maps used to store `Widget` objects associated with different keys.

The conflict arises in the constructor `DebugScreen()` where two different versions of code are presented:

1. The version from `HEAD` (typically the local branch being worked on):
   ```java
plugin = Spout.getPluginManager().getMetaPlugin();
```

2. The version from the commit `67bcb76a96f358fc131320b0611ffaa3bf3678c2` (the change being merged in):
   ```java
plugin = ((PluginManager) Spout.getPluginManager()).getMetaPlugin();
```

The difference between these two lines is the cast to `PluginManager` in the second version. This cast suggests that `Spout.getPluginManager()` returns a more general type (likely `Object` or an interface/type that is a parent of `PluginManager`), and the code being merged in believes it's necessary to explicitly cast it to `PluginManager` to call `getMetaPlugin()`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes.

1. The original code (`HEAD`) assumes that `Spout.getPluginManager()` returns something that directly supports calling `getMetaPlugin()`, implying that it either returns a `PluginManager` or a type that has a `getMetaPlugin()` method.

2. The incoming change introduces a cast to `PluginManager`, indicating that without this cast, the code would not compile, likely because `Spout.getPluginManager()` returns a type that doesn't directly support `getMetaPlugin()` without being cast to `PluginManager`.

Given these observations, the intent seems to be that `Spout.getPluginManager()` needs to be treated as a `PluginManager` to access `getMetaPlugin()`. Thus, the cast is necessary if `getPluginManager()` doesn't directly return a `PluginManager` or a type that knows about `getMetaPlugin()`.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent of both sides (though it seems like the main intent here is to make the code compile with the necessary cast), we should consider if the cast is necessary and if it aligns with the type returned by `Spout.getPluginManager()`.

Since we don't have information about the type returned by `Spout.getPluginManager()` or the exact nature of the change that introduced the cast, the most straightforward resolution that maintains the functionality intended by both sides (and assumes that the cast is necessary for compilation or correctness) is to use the version with the cast.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
	private final Map<Integer, Widget> spoutMessages = new HashMap<Integer, Widget>();
	// The hashmap that contains the plugin's debug messages
	private final Map<Plugin, Widget> messages = new HashMap<Plugin, Widget>();

	public DebugScreen() {
		plugin = ((PluginManager) Spout.getPluginManager()).getMetaPlugin();
		init();
	}

	@Override
	public void open() {
```
