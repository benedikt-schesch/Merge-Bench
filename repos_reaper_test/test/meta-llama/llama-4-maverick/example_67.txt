To resolve this merge conflict, we first need to understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of a method that constructs a list of card data (`cardData`) for a card game, potentially a game like Cards Against Humanity. The list is being populated with data representing white cards played by a player and face-down cards.

The conflict arises in the line where face-down card data is being added to `cardData`. The two versions of this line are:
- `cardData.add(Arrays.asList(WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()));` from the `HEAD` (typically the local branch or the branch being merged into).
- `cardData.add(Collections.singletonList(WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()));` from the commit `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a` (typically the branch being merged).

Both lines are attempting to add a representation of a face-down white card to `cardData`. The difference lies in how they create a list containing the face-down card data.

`Arrays.asList(WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData())` creates a fixed-size list containing the elements returned by `WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()`. If `WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()` returns a single object or a varargs (variable-length arguments), this will work as expected. However, if it returns an array or a collection, it will be wrapped as a single element in the list.

`Collections.singletonList(WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData())` creates an immutable list containing exactly one element, which is the result of `WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()`. This is more explicit in its intent to add a single element to the list.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent and the semantics of both changes. 

Given that both sides are essentially trying to add a single face-down card representation to `cardData`, and assuming `WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()` returns a single object (not a collection or array), both approaches are semantically similar but differ in their implementation.

`Collections.singletonList` is more efficient when you need to create a list with a single element because it is more explicit and doesn't involve the varargs machinery of `Arrays.asList`. It directly conveys the intent of having a list with one element.

Since the difference is primarily in how the list is created and both achieve the goal of adding the face-down card data to the list, we can choose the more efficient and semantically clear approach.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
          cardData.add(getWhiteCardData(playedCards.getCards(player)));
          faceDownCards--;
        }
        // TODO make this figure out how many blank cards in each spot, for multi-play cards
        while (faceDownCards-- > 0) {
          cardData.add(Collections.singletonList(WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()));
        }
        return cardData;
      }
    }
  }
