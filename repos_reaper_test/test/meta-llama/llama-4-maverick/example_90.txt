To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a Java class file that belongs to a package `net.socialgamer.cah.cardcast`. The conflict arises from the import statements.

On the left-hand side (`HEAD`), we have:
```java
import com.google.inject.AbstractModule;
import com.google.inject.BindingAnnotation;
import com.google.inject.Provides;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.GameOptions;
```

On the right-hand side (`ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967`), we have:
```java
import com.google.inject.*;
import net.socialgamer.cah.CahModule;
```

The left-hand side is importing specific classes from the `com.google.inject` package, namely `AbstractModule`, `BindingAnnotation`, and `Provides`. It also imports `GameOptions` from `net.socialgamer.cah.data`.

The right-hand side is using a wildcard import (`*`) to import all classes from `com.google.inject`, and it imports `CahModule` from `net.socialgamer.cah`.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both sets of imports. The left-hand side is explicitly importing specific classes, suggesting that these classes are being used in the file. The right-hand side is using a wildcard import, which could be importing classes that are not actually used in the file, but it also imports `CahModule`, which is not present on the left-hand side.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the right-hand side is likely trying to import necessary classes for Guice module configuration, given the presence of `CahModule`. The left-hand side is also configuring Guice modules, as evidenced by the import of `AbstractModule`.

The conflict can be resolved by combining the necessary imports from both sides. However, we should avoid using wildcard imports if possible, to maintain clarity on which classes are being used.

Here's the resolution:
