To resolve the merge conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides.

The original code snippet is an enumeration of error codes or status codes with corresponding reasons. The conflict arises between two commits: `HEAD` and `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a`. 

On the `HEAD` side, there's a change related to a "CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND" error message, suggesting a scenario where a custom deck cannot be found or there's an issue with the provided JSON.

On the `5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a` side, two new error codes are introduced: "CARDCAST_CANNOT_FIND" and "CARDCAST_INVALID_ID". These relate to issues with Cardcast deck IDs, either not being found or being invalid.

To resolve this conflict, we should consider whether the changes on both sides are related and whether they can coexist.

Upon examination, the changes are distinct and pertain to different error conditions. The `HEAD` side modifies an existing error message related to custom sets, while the other side introduces new error codes related to Cardcast decks.

Given that these changes are semantically distinct and do not directly conflict with each other in terms of intent or functionality, we can resolve the conflict by keeping both changes.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

        + "was provided."),
    CARDCAST_CANNOT_FIND("ccf", "Cannot find Cardcast deck with given ID. If you just added this"
            + " deck to Cardcast, wait a few minutes and try again."),
