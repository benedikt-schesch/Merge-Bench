To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The provided Java code snippet appears to be part of a class that implements `Parcelable`, likely for an Android application. The class seems to be related to options or settings for a component or view named `Galgo`. The snippet includes a constructor for `GalgoOptions` that takes another `GalgoOptions` object as a parameter and a private constructor that reads data from a `Parcel` object, which is used in the parcelable implementation.

The conflict is between the lines marked by `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> 0b628c40c6a74e31e3c63b0b545670b5fc2b68c0`. The `HEAD` side has a blank line (or possibly some content that was removed or not committed), and the other side (`0b628c40c6a74e31e3c63b0b545670b5fc2b68c0`) has nothing, indicating that it has removed something or is simply a marker for the end of the conflict.

To resolve this conflict, we should consider what both sides are trying to achieve:

1. The `HEAD` side does not introduce any new code or significant changes within the conflict area; it appears to be either unchanged or a placeholder/empty line.
2. The other side (`0b628c40c6a74e31e3c63b0b545670b5fc2b68c0`) effectively removes or does not include whatever is on the `HEAD` side within the conflict markers.

Since there's no actual code change within the conflict area on either side (the `HEAD` side is blank or unchanged, and the other side doesn't introduce new code within the conflict markers), and without more context about what the `HEAD` side is supposed to represent or contain, the most straightforward resolution is to remove the conflict markers and decide on the intent.

If we are to preserve the spacing as is and not modify the context, and considering there's no actual conflict in terms of code changes, we can directly return the snippet with the conflict resolved by removing the markers and the content within them, which doesn't exist.

Here's the resolution in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
            return new GalgoOptions(this);
        }
    }

    // Parcelable implementation

    private GalgoOptions(Parcel source) {
        numberOfLines = source.readInt();
        backgroundColor = source.readInt();
        textColor = source.readInt();
        errorTextColor = source.readInt();

```
