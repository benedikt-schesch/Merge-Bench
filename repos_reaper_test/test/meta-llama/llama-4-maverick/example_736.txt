To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of a class that extends another class (likely a view or a similar UI component given the presence of `context` and `attrs` in the `super` call). The method `setAspectRatio(double ratio)` is where the conflict occurs.

```java
        super(context, attrs);
        setAspectRatio(4.0 / 3.0);
    }

    public void setAspectRatio(double ratio) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        if (ratio <= 0.0) throw new IllegalArgumentException();

        ratio = 1 / ratio;
=======
        if (ratio <= 0.0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c

        ratio = 1 / ratio;

        if (mAspectRatio != ratio) {
            mAspectRatio = ratio;
```

Let's analyze the changes:

1. On the left side (`HEAD`), the code checks if `ratio` is less than or equal to `0.0` and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if true. It then inverts the `ratio` by doing `ratio = 1 / ratio;`.

2. On the right side (`c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c`), the code does a similar check but formats the exception throwing differently, with the throw statement on a new line within a block. It then proceeds to invert the `ratio` in the same manner.

The key observation here is that both sides of the merge are essentially doing the same thing: checking for an invalid `ratio` and throwing an exception if it's invalid, and then inverting the `ratio`. The difference lies in the formatting of the exception throwing.

After the conflict markers, the code continues with `ratio = 1 / ratio;` again, followed by a check to see if `mAspectRatio` needs to be updated. This repeated inversion (`ratio = 1 / ratio;`) appears to be a mistake as it would negate the initial inversion, effectively not changing the `ratio`. However, this is present on both sides, so it's not directly related to the merge conflict.

To resolve the conflict, we need to decide on the formatting. Both versions are semantically equivalent. The left side (`HEAD`) is more concise, while the right side is more verbose but potentially clearer in its intent due to the explicit block.

Since there's no clear semantic difference and both are valid Java code, we can choose either. Let's preserve the original context and spacing and resolve the conflict by picking the more verbose version for its clarity, but we'll remove the redundant `ratio = 1 / ratio;` after the conflict to fix the apparent bug.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
        super(context, attrs);
        setAspectRatio(4.0 / 3.0);
    }

    public void setAspectRatio(double ratio) {
        if (ratio <= 0.0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }

        ratio = 1 / ratio;

        if (mAspectRatio != ratio) {
            mAspectRatio = ratio;
```
