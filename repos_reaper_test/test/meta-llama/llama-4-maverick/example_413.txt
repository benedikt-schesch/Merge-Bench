To address this task, I must first understand the context and the merge conflict presented in the code snippet. The conflict is within the import statements of a Java class.

The given code snippet is:
```java
import org.apache.commons.configuration.ConfigurationException;
import org.jbake.app.FileUtil;
import org.jbake.app.JBakeException;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfigurationFactory;
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import org.jbake.util.ConfigurationPrinter;
import org.kohsuke.args4j.CmdLineException;
import org.kohsuke.args4j.CmdLineParser;
>>>>>>> d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.slf4j.bridge.SLF4JBridgeHandler;
import picocli.CommandLine;
import picocli.CommandLine.MissingParameterException;
```

The conflict arises from the difference in import statements between the `HEAD` branch and the `d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb` commit. The `HEAD` branch does not contain the imports for `ConfigurationPrinter`, `CmdLineException`, and `CmdLineParser`, which are present in the other commit.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to understand the intent behind the imports on both sides. The imports on the `HEAD` branch suggest that the code is utilizing JBake's configuration and exception handling, along with SLF4J for logging and Picocli for command-line parsing. The additional imports on the other side (`ConfigurationPrinter`, `CmdLineException`, and `CmdLineParser`) indicate the use of a utility for printing configuration and the args4j library for command-line parsing.

The presence of both Picocli and args4j (`CmdLineException`, `CmdLineParser`) for command-line parsing on the `d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb` side is noteworthy. Typically, a project would use one command-line parsing library. The use of both might indicate a transition from args4j to Picocli or vice versa, or they might be used in different contexts within the project.

Given the information available, to resolve the conflict, we should consider whether the imports from both sides are necessary and relevant to the current state of the code.

Since we don't have the exact context or the rest of the code, a safe resolution is to include all the imports, assuming they are relevant. The resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, without modifying the context and preserving the spacing, would be:

```java
import org.apache.commons.configuration.ConfigurationException;
import org.jbake.app.FileUtil;
import org.jbake.app.JBakeException;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfigurationFactory;
import org.jbake.util.ConfigurationPrinter;
import org.kohsuke.args4j.CmdLineException;
import org.kohsuke.args4j.CmdLineParser;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.slf4j.bridge.SLF4JBridgeHandler;
import picocli.CommandLine;
import picocli.CommandLine.MissingParameterException;
```

However, it's worth noting that using both args4j and Picocli might not be ideal unless they serve distinct purposes within the codebase. A more thorough review of the project's requirements and the rest of the code would be necessary to determine if both libraries are needed.

The response in the required format is:
```java
import org.apache.commons.configuration.ConfigurationException;
import org.jbake.app.FileUtil;
import org.jbake.app.JBakeException;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfigurationFactory;
import org.jbake.util.ConfigurationPrinter;
import org.kohsuke.args4j.CmdLineException;
import org.kohsuke.args4j.CmdLineParser;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.slf4j.bridge.SLF4JBridgeHandler;
import picocli.CommandLine;
import picocli.CommandLine.MissingParameterException;
```
