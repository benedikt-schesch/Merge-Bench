To resolve the given merge conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The original code snippet is as follows:
```java
     */
    public void attachInput(PigNullableWritable k, Iterator<NullableTuple> inp) {
        try {
            tupIter = inp;
            key = pkgr.getKey(k);
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
            keyWritable = k;
>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a
            inputAttached = true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "Error attaching input for key " + k +
                    " in " + name() + " at location " + getOriginalLocations(), e);

```

The conflict arises from the addition of a line `keyWritable = k;` in the branch being merged into the current branch (HEAD). 

Let's analyze the change:
- The variable `key` is assigned the result of `pkgr.getKey(k)`, suggesting that `key` is derived from `k` but might not be the same as `k`. 
- The added line assigns `k` directly to `keyWritable`, indicating that `keyWritable` is intended to hold the original `PigNullableWritable` object `k`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider whether both `key` and `keyWritable` are necessary and how they are used elsewhere in the code.

1. **Understanding the variables**:
   - `key` is derived from `k` using `pkgr.getKey(k)`.
   - `keyWritable` is directly assigned `k`.

2. **Analyzing the intent**:
   - The introduction of `keyWritable = k;` suggests that there is a need to store or use the original `PigNullableWritable` object `k` directly, not just its derived key.

3. **Resolving the conflict**:
   - If `keyWritable` is necessary for the functionality introduced or modified in the branch being merged, and it doesn't conflict with the existing functionality in HEAD, then the change should be accepted.

Given the information and the code snippet, it appears that the change is adding a new variable assignment that doesn't directly conflict with existing code in terms of syntax or variable usage (since it's introducing a new variable). 

Therefore, the resolution involves accepting the change and including `keyWritable = k;` in the merged code.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
     */
    public void attachInput(PigNullableWritable k, Iterator<NullableTuple> inp) {
        try {
            tupIter = inp;
            key = pkgr.getKey(k);
            keyWritable = k;
            inputAttached = true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "Error attaching input for key " + k +
                    " in " + name() + " at location " + getOriginalLocations(), e);

```
