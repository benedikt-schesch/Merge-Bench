To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles some form of 3D projection, given the use of `Matrix4` and methods like `createPerspective`.

1. **Understanding the Conflict:**
   - The conflict is within the `onAttached()` method.
   - The `HEAD` version (typically the local or current branch) contains the line `projection = Matrix4.createPerspective(fieldOfView, 4.0f / 3.0f, .001f, 1000f);`.
   - The other version (`cc0703054530b4eeda07a2b1b619ed34e1e7d201`) contains `this.projection = MatrixMath.createPerspective(fieldOfView, 4.0f / 3.0f, .001f, 1000f);`.

2. **Analyzing the Changes:**
   - Both versions are attempting to set a perspective projection matrix when the object is attached.
   - The difference lies in two aspects:
     - The class used to create the perspective matrix (`Matrix4` vs `MatrixMath`).
     - The use of `this` keyword to refer to the `projection` field.

3. **Resolving the Conflict:**
   - **Class/Method Name Change:** `Matrix4.createPerspective` vs `MatrixMath.createPerspective`. This could indicate a refactoring where `Matrix4` has been replaced or supplemented by `MatrixMath` for creating perspective matrices. If `MatrixMath` is the newer or preferred API, the change to `MatrixMath.createPerspective` should be kept.
   - **Use of `this` Keyword:** The addition of `this` explicitly refers to the class field `projection`, which can improve clarity, especially if there's a local variable or method parameter with the same name. However, in this snippet, there's no indication of such a naming conflict.

4. **Semantic Intent:**
   - Both sides intend to set the `projection` field to a perspective projection matrix with the specified parameters upon attachment.
   - The changes are not conflicting in terms of functionality but rather represent different coding styles or API usages.

Given the analysis, a reasonable resolution would be to adopt the changes from the other version (`cc0703054530b4eeda07a2b1b619ed34e1e7d201`), as it potentially reflects a more updated or preferred API (`MatrixMath` instead of `Matrix4`), and includes the explicit `this` reference for clarity.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
	updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public void onAttached() {
		// TODO: Get FOV
		this.projection = MatrixMath.createPerspective(fieldOfView, 4.0f / 3.0f, .001f, 1000f);
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public Matrix4 getProjection() {
```
