To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class or method that involves importing various classes from the Apache Pig library. Apache Pig is a high-level data processing language and framework used for processing large datasets.

The conflict arises from the addition of a new import statement in one branch (`88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) that is not present in the other (`HEAD`). The import statement in question is for the `Packager` class.

Let's analyze the intent and semantics:

1. **Existing Imports (`HEAD`)**: The existing imports suggest that the code is working with various relational operators (`POSkewedJoin`, `POSort`, `POSplit`, `POStore`, `POUnion`) and classes related to plan visitors and operators (`DepthFirstWalker`, `Operator`, `OperatorPlan`, `PlanVisitor`, `VisitorException`). These are all part of the Apache Pig's backend and plan execution framework.

2. **New Import (`88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`)**: The new import is for `Packager`, which is also a part of Apache Pig's backend (`org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators`). The `Packager` class is related to packaging tuples for join operations, indicating its relevance to the relational operators already being imported.

Given the context, the addition of `Packager` seems to be a valid and relevant change. The `Packager` class is used in the context of join operations and is related to other classes being imported. Therefore, its inclusion does not seem to conflict with the existing imports semantically; rather, it complements them.

To resolve the conflict, we will include both the existing imports and the new import. The resolution involves simply removing the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and ensuring that all relevant import statements are included.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:
