To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the intent of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a larger method that processes a `rawPicture` object and assigns a value to the `picture` variable based on its contents. The `rawPicture` object seems to be a JSON object that may contain a "data" field, which is further processed.

On the left-hand side (HEAD), the code retrieves the "data" object from `rawPicture`, converts it to a string, and then maps this string to a `ProfilePictureSource` object using `jsonMapper.toJavaObject`. The resulting object is assigned to the `picture` variable.

On the right-hand side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe), the code directly retrieves a "data" JsonObject from `rawPicture` using `getJsonObject("data")`. It then extracts a "url" string from this "data" object and assigns it to the `picture` variable.

The intent on both sides seems to be to extract relevant information from the `rawPicture` object and assign it to `picture`. However, they differ in what they consider relevant: the left side is interested in mapping the entire "data" object to a `ProfilePictureSource` object, while the right side is only interested in extracting the "url" string from the "data" object.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to consider what the `picture` variable is expected to hold and what the downstream code expects it to contain. If `picture` is expected to be a `ProfilePictureSource` object, the left side's changes are more appropriate. If `picture` is expected to be a URL string (or can be adapted to be so), the right side's changes could be more suitable.

However, without additional context on how `picture` is used later in the code, it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict based solely on the given snippet.

Let's examine the code and see if we can make an educated decision:

- Both versions check if `picData` (or its equivalent) is not null before attempting to use it, showing a similar intent in handling potential null values.
- The left side maps the "data" object to a specific Java object (`ProfilePictureSource`), suggesting that the code might be expecting a more complex data structure or that `ProfilePictureSource` provides additional functionality or validation.
- The right side directly extracts a "url" from the "data" object, implying that the immediate need is for the URL string.

Given the information and focusing on preserving the semantic intent, if we had to choose, the left-hand side seems to be mapping to a more structured object (`ProfilePictureSource`), which might be more beneficial if the downstream code uses this object for further processing or validation. However, the right-hand side directly extracts the "url", which could be more straightforward if the `picture` variable is primarily used to hold or display the URL.

Since the `picture` variable's type and its subsequent usage are not clear, and without knowing the specific requirements or constraints of the downstream code, the safest approach might be to preserve the conflict as is or to choose one side based on additional context not provided.

For now, let's return the snippet with the conflict as is, wrapped in markdown code syntax:

```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

<<<<<<< HEAD
    JsonObject picData = rawPicture.get("data").asObject();
    if (picData != null) {
      picture = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(picData.toString(), ProfilePictureSource.class);
    }
  }

=======
    JsonObject picData = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data");
    if (picData != null) {
      picture = picData.getString("url");
    }
  }
