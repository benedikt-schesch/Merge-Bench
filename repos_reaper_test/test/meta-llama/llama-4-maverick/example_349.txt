To resolve the given merge conflict, we should first understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a class that has a `toString()` method, which is used to return a version string. The version string is modified when the application is running as a native image. 

The conflict arises from the way the property for checking if the application is running as a native image is accessed. 

On the left-hand side (`HEAD`), the code directly uses a string literal `"org.graalvm.nativeimage.imagecode"` to get the system property and checks its value against the string literal `"runtime"`.

On the right-hand side (`2a9778c6bfd2a032bf3a67da5cfb9d6ec9364a04`), the code uses constants `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY` and `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME` for the same purpose.

The intent behind using constants on the right-hand side is likely to make the code more readable, maintainable, and less prone to typos. It suggests that these constants are or will be defined elsewhere in the codebase, possibly with clear documentation about their purpose.

To resolve the conflict, we should consider the overall coding style and practices used in the project. If the project tends to use constants for such property keys and values, the version on the right-hand side is more aligned with the project's coding standards.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
    }

    public String toString() {
      // When running the application as a native image, append `-graalvm` to the
      // version.
      String imageCode = System.getProperty(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY);
      if (imageCode != null && imageCode.equals(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME)) {
        String[] tokens = versionString.split(" ");
        if (tokens.length > 0 && tokens[0].startsWith("gl-java")) {
          tokens[0] += "-graalvm";
          return Joiner.on(" ").join(tokens);
        }

```
