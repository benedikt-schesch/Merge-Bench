To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is testing the ordering of tuples in a Pig server. The test first registers a query that orders the data in "c" by "value". Then, it checks the order of elements in "b1" and "c1" after executing certain operations.

The conflict arises in how the test verifies the values retrieved from "b1". The left side of the conflict (HEAD) checks the values as `long` values, expecting `12` and then `2`, suggesting it treats the field as numeric. On the other hand, the right side (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) checks the values as `String` ("12" and then "2"), indicating it treats the field as a string, likely due to a change in how data is being processed or interpreted.

Let's consider the semantic intent:
1. The comment above the test indicates that the order is lexicographic, meaning the values are treated as strings. In lexicographic order, "12" indeed comes before "2" because the comparison is made character by character.
2. The left side (HEAD) is comparing the values as `long`, which implies a numeric comparison. However, this contradicts the comment about lexicographic ordering unless there's an expectation that the data is numeric.
3. The right side (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) compares the values as `String`, aligning with the lexicographic ordering comment.

To resolve the conflict, we should align the test with the expected data type and ordering. Since the comment explicitly mentions lexicographic ordering, which applies to strings, the right side's approach seems more appropriate.

Here's the resolution, preserving the context and spacing, and returning it in markdown code syntax:

```java
        pigServer.registerQuery("c1 = order c by value;");

        // order in lexicographic, so 12 comes before 2
        Iterator<Tuple> iter = pigServer.openIterator("b1");
        assertTrue("b1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
        assertEquals("first item in b1", iter.next().get(0), "12");
        assertTrue("b1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
        assertEquals("second item in b1", iter.next().get(0), "2");
        assertFalse("b1 is over", iter.hasNext());

        iter = pigServer.openIterator("c1");
        assertTrue("c1 has an element", iter.hasNext());
```
