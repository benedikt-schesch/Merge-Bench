To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a larger Java method or class that is responsible for configuring a job update in a distributed system, possibly within the Aurora scheduler framework given the class and method names. The snippet is configuring `JobUpdateInstructions` with a desired state and update settings.

The conflict arises in the `.setUpdateStrategy()` or `.setUpdateGroupSize()` part of the `JobUpdateSettings` configuration.

On one side (`HEAD`), the code is using `.setUpdateStrategy()` with a `JobUpdateStrategy.queueStrategy()` and setting the group size to 1 using `new QueueJobUpdateStrategy().setGroupSize(1)`.

On the other side (`4e28e73bb83b75f1369a705d15c96e40fb7098e1`), the code is directly using `.setUpdateGroupSize(updateGroupSize)`, suggesting a change in how the update group size is being configured, potentially simplifying or making it more configurable.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to understand the intent behind both changes:

1. The `HEAD` version explicitly sets an update strategy with a fixed group size of 1. This could imply a cautious or sequential update strategy where instances are updated one by one.

2. The other version (`4e28e73bb83b75f1369a705d15c96e40fb7098e1`) introduces a variable `updateGroupSize`, suggesting a more flexible configuration where the group size is not fixed and can be determined based on other factors or configurations.

Given these observations, a resolution that respects both intents could involve incorporating the `updateGroupSize` variable into the `JobUpdateStrategy.queueStrategy()` configuration, if that's the intended update strategy, or choosing one approach over the other if they are mutually exclusive.

However, directly merging the two as is might not be straightforward because they represent different configuration approaches.

Let's directly examine the provided snippet and apply a potential resolution by considering the semantic intent:

```java
        .setInstructions(new JobUpdateInstructions()
            .setDesiredState(new InstanceTaskConfig()
                .setTask(newConfig.newBuilder())
                .setInstances(ImmutableSet.of(new Range(0, 2))))
            .setSettings(new JobUpdateSettings()
                .setUpdateStrategy(
                    JobUpdateStrategy.queueStrategy(new QueueJobUpdateStrategy().setGroupSize(updateGroupSize)))
                .setRollbackOnFailure(true)
                .setMinWaitInInstanceRunningMs(WATCH_TIMEOUT.as(Time.MILLISECONDS).intValue())
                .setUpdateOnlyTheseInstances(ImmutableSet.of())));

    for (IInstanceTaskConfig config : configs) {
```

The resolution involves using `.setUpdateStrategy()` with `updateGroupSize`, effectively combining the intent of having a configurable group size with the `queueStrategy` update strategy.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
        .setInstructions(new JobUpdateInstructions()
            .setDesiredState(new InstanceTaskConfig()
                .setTask(newConfig.newBuilder())
                .setInstances(ImmutableSet.of(new Range(0, 2))))
            .setSettings(new JobUpdateSettings()
                .setUpdateStrategy(
                    JobUpdateStrategy.queueStrategy(new QueueJobUpdateStrategy().setGroupSize(updateGroupSize)))
                .setRollbackOnFailure(true)
                .setMinWaitInInstanceRunningMs(WATCH_TIMEOUT.as(Time.MILLISECONDS).intValue())
                .setUpdateOnlyTheseInstances(ImmutableSet.of())));

    for (IInstanceTaskConfig config : configs) {
```
