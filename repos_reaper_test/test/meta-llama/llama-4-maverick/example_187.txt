To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is for a `BufferedPositionedInputStream` class constructor in Java. The class seems to be designed to handle input streams with buffering and position tracking.

On the left-hand side (HEAD), the code simply assigns the provided `InputStream` to the class field `in`.

```java
this.in = in;
```

On the right-hand side (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309), there's a conditional assignment based on the type of `InputStream`. If `in` is an instance of `CBZip2InputStream`, it's assigned directly; otherwise, it's wrapped in a `BufferedInputStream` with a specified buffer size before assignment.

```java
if (in instanceof CBZip2InputStream) this.in = in;
else this.in = new BufferedInputStream(in, bufSize);
```

The intent behind the right-hand side's change seems to be avoiding buffering for `CBZip2InputStream` instances to prevent issues with split records, while still utilizing buffering for other types of input streams to potentially improve performance.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider whether the logic on the right-hand side is necessary and if it aligns with the overall intent of the `BufferedPositionedInputStream` class. The class name suggests that it is meant to provide buffering, so selectively avoiding buffering based on the input stream type could be a valid optimization or workaround for specific issues (like the mentioned problem with bzip streams and split records).

Given this context, the resolution could involve adopting the logic from the right-hand side, as it seems to handle a specific edge case while still providing buffering where it's deemed safe or beneficial.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
    long pos;
    InputStream in;
    final int bufSize = 1024;
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in, long pos) {
        // Don't buffer a bzip stream as it will cause problems for split
        // records.
        if (in instanceof CBZip2InputStream) this.in = in;
        else this.in = new BufferedInputStream(in, bufSize);
        this.pos = pos;
    }
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in){
        this(in,0);
```
