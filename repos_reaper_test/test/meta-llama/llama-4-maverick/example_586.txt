To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The context is a Java import statement section within a class or file that utilizes the RestFB library for interacting with Facebook's API. The snippet includes various import statements for exceptions and classes related to RestFB.

The conflict arises from the addition of an import statement in one of the merge branches (the one represented by `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) that is not present in the other (represented by `HEAD`). The added import statement is for `com.restfb.exception.ResponseErrorJsonParsingException`.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent and semantics of both sides. The branch `HEAD` includes a set of import statements for various Facebook-related exceptions and a `ScopeBuilder` class. The other branch adds an import for `ResponseErrorJsonParsingException`, which is also related to handling Facebook API response errors.

Given that the additional import does not conflict with any existing imports and is related to the same library and functionality (error handling for Facebook API responses), it is reasonable to include this import. The presence of `ResponseErrorJsonParsingException` suggests it might be used somewhere in the code to handle a specific type of exception that could occur when parsing error responses from Facebook.

Therefore, resolving the conflict by including the new import statement makes sense if the code in the merged result will utilize `ResponseErrorJsonParsingException`. 

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java

import com.restfb.WebRequestor.Response;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookJsonMappingException;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookOAuthException;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookResponseContentException;
import com.restfb.exception.ResponseErrorJsonParsingException;
import com.restfb.exception.devicetoken.FacebookDeviceTokenCodeExpiredException;
import com.restfb.exception.devicetoken.FacebookDeviceTokenDeclinedException;
import com.restfb.exception.devicetoken.FacebookDeviceTokenPendingException;
import com.restfb.exception.devicetoken.FacebookDeviceTokenSlowdownException;
import com.restfb.scope.ScopeBuilder;
