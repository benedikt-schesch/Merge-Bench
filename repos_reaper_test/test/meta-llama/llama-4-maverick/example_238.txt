The conflict is between an empty change on the HEAD side and the addition of a license header on the other side (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309). Since the change on the HEAD side is empty and doesn't affect the code, I will resolve the conflict by keeping the change from the other side. The result is the code snippet above.
