To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and involves various imports from different packages, including `com.yahoo.labs.samoa` and `com.github.javacliparser`. The conflict arises from the fact that the `HEAD` (typically representing the local or current branch being worked on) and the commit `40d31d67633f703171421ba4d73bb421d89a32db` (representing the other branch being merged into the current branch) have differing import statements.

On the `HEAD` side, we have imports that include:
- `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.instances.Instances;`
- `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.learners.Learner;`
- `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.Stream;`
- `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.TopologyBuilder;`

On the other side of the merge (`40d31d67633f703171421ba4d73bb421d89a32db`), the imports include:
- `com.github.javacliparser.ClassOption;`
- `com.github.javacliparser.Configurable;`
- `com.github.javacliparser.IntOption;`
- `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.core.Processor;`
- `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.instances.Instances;`

Notice that `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.instances.Instances` is imported on both sides. The task now is to understand the intent behind these imports and resolve the conflict accordingly.

The `HEAD` side seems to be focused on Samoa-related imports, particularly those related to learners and topology, which are crucial for building and managing data processing pipelines or machine learning models within the Samoa framework.

The other side (`40d31d67633f703171421ba4d73bb421d89a32db`) introduces imports from `com.github.javacliparser`, indicating the use of a command-line parser, and also includes `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.core.Processor`, suggesting it's dealing with processing data within Samoa. It also imports `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.instances.Instances`, which is common on both sides.

To resolve the conflict, we should aim to combine the necessary imports from both sides in a way that makes semantic sense. Since `com.yahoo.labs.samoa.instances.Instances` is present on both sides, it should only appear once in the resolved code.

The resolved code should include all the unique imports from both sides without duplication. Thus, the imports from `com.github.javacliparser` and the necessary Samoa-related imports should be combined.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
import java.util.List;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import com.github.javacliparser.ClassOption;
import com.github.javacliparser.Configurable;
import com.github.javacliparser.IntOption;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.core.Processor;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.instances.Instances;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.learners.Learner;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.Stream;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.TopologyBuilder;
```

This resolution includes all the necessary imports from both sides of the merge, ensuring that the code has access to all the required classes without any duplication.
