To resolve the merge conflict, let's first examine the given code snippet and understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.


```java
import org.hbase.async.KeyValue;
import org.hbase.async.PutRequest;
import org.hbase.async.RowLock;
import org.hbase.async.RowLockRequest;
import org.hbase.async.Scanner;
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
import org.slf4j.Logger;

import org.hbase.async.test.Common;

/**
```


The conflict is between the lines `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`. The left side of the conflict (between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`) is empty, indicating that the local branch (HEAD) has not introduced any new import statements in this section. The right side of the conflict (between `=======` and `>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`) is also empty, indicating that the other branch (d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f) has not introduced any new import statements either.


Since both sides of the conflict are essentially empty and there's no actual change being made in terms of import statements between the conflict markers, we can resolve this by removing the conflict markers.


Here's the resolution:


```java
import org.hbase.async.KeyValue;
import org.hbase.async.PutRequest;
import org.hbase.async.RowLock;
import org.hbase.async.RowLockRequest;
import org.hbase.async.Scanner;
import org.slf4j.Logger;

import org.hbase.async.test.Common;
