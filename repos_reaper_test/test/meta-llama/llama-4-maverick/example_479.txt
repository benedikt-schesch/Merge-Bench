To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of an Android application using the AndEngine library for game development. The snippet includes a list of import statements that bring in various AndEngine classes and Android's graphics classes.

The merge conflict is on the import statements, specifically around the line that imports `VertexBufferObjectManager`. The conflict is between the local version (`HEAD`) and the version from the commit `e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885`.

1. The `HEAD` side does not include the import statement for `VertexBufferObjectManager`.
2. The other side (`e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885`) includes the import statement for `VertexBufferObjectManager`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind including or not including the `VertexBufferObjectManager` import.

- If the code in `HEAD` does not use `VertexBufferObjectManager`, and there's no indication that it's needed, then the import might not be necessary. However, the commit `e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885` suggests that it was added for a reason, potentially indicating its use or planned use in the code not shown in this snippet.
- The inclusion of `VertexBufferObjectManager` in the other commit could imply that there are changes (either in this file or other files part of the commit) that utilize this class, suggesting its import is necessary for compilation or functionality.

Since the snippet doesn't show the actual usage of `VertexBufferObjectManager` and without more context on what changes were made in `e3e5d83603e97ebcc76c7eba09ddc2b147105885`, the safest resolution that doesn't risk removing necessary imports is to include the import statement for `VertexBufferObjectManager`.

Thus, the resolved snippet, presented in markdown code syntax as requested, is:
