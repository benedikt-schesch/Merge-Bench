To resolve the given merge conflict, I will first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The given Java code snippet appears to be part of a class that represents a Facebook object or a similar entity, given the presence of `@Facebook` annotations. The class has properties related to commenting or ordering, and it utilizes Lombok annotations (`@Getter`, `@Setter`) to automatically generate getter and setter methods for the class fields.

The conflict arises between the local changes (`HEAD`) and the changes from the commit `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`. The local changes include the declaration of a `canComment` field with Lombok annotations for getter and setter generation. On the other hand, the incoming changes do not include this field but introduce other fields related to Open Graph protocol properties (`openGraphCommentOrder` and `openGraphCanComment`).

Upon closer inspection, it appears that `canComment` and `openGraphCanComment` might be related, as they both seem to be associated with the capability to comment. However, they are annotated differently, suggesting they might serve different purposes or be used in different contexts (`canComment` is a simple Java property, while `openGraphCanComment` is annotated with `@Facebook`, indicating it might be directly related to a Facebook Open Graph API property).

To resolve the conflict, one needs to consider the intent behind both changes. The local change (`HEAD`) introduces a `canComment` property, potentially for general use within the application. The incoming change introduces `openGraphCommentOrder` and `openGraphCanComment`, which are specifically related to Facebook's Open Graph properties.

Given that both changes introduce different properties, and there's no direct indication that they conflict semantically (beyond the fact that `canComment` and `openGraphCanComment` could be seen as related or redundant), a reasonable resolution could be to include all changes. However, the presence of potentially related fields (`canComment` and `openGraphCanComment`) might suggest a need for review to ensure they are not redundant or that they serve distinct purposes as intended.

Since the intent behind `canComment` and `openGraphCanComment` isn't explicitly clear from the given context, and assuming they might be distinct based on their annotations and names, the conflict can be resolved by keeping both. Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  private String order;

  @Getter
  @Setter
  private Boolean canComment;

  @Facebook("comment_order")
  private String openGraphCommentOrder;

  @Facebook("can_comment")
  private Boolean openGraphCanComment;
```

This resolution keeps both `canComment` and `openGraphCanComment`, as they seem to serve different purposes based on their annotations, and there's no clear indication that one replaces the other. If they are redundant, further refactoring might be necessary to align with the application's intent and requirements.
