To resolve this conflict, let's first understand the intent behind both versions.

The version on `HEAD` simply assigns a string literal `"1.30.5"` to the `VERSION` field after calling `toString()` on it, which is redundant because string literals in Java are already strings. The comment suggests that there's some sort of version management or update mechanism in place (`// {x-version-update-end:google-api-client:current}`), possibly indicating that this line is managed or updated by some external tool or process.

The version on `a6c6decbd4a162ff4030e2c3f74c72eb6ac9eddb` assigns the result of a method call `getVersion()` to `VERSION`. This suggests a more dynamic approach to determining the version, possibly fetching it from a configuration, a database, or computing it based on some criteria.

Given the information available, it seems that both approaches are trying to achieve the same goal - setting the `VERSION` field to the correct version of the GoogleUtils class. However, they are doing it in different ways. The `HEAD` version is static and managed, presumably by an external tool, while the other version is dynamic, relying on the `getVersion()` method.

Without knowing the specifics of how `getVersion()` works or how the version management tool operates, it's challenging to definitively resolve this conflict. However, if we consider the intent to be having a reliable and accurate version number, and assuming `getVersion()` is a more modern or flexible way to achieve this (potentially incorporating build time, git hash, or other dynamic information), one potential resolution could be to favor the dynamic version.

That being said, since the context does not provide enough details on the `getVersion()` method or the implications of using one version over the other, and without modifying the context or the provided code, the snippet remains with the conflict.

Hence, the response remains:
