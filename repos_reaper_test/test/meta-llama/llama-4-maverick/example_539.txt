To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The given code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a method handling some Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) operation, given the presence of terms like `characteristicUuid` and `connection`. The method seems to handle writing to a BLE characteristic and manages callbacks for such operations.

The conflict arises between two commits (or branches), where one side (`HEAD`) has some code, and the other side (`2efc89dde2658f518e6b6ca936296c207e08d65c`) has nothing (or effectively removed something) in the conflicting region.

Let's break down the code and the conflict:

1. Before the conflict, there's a block that checks for an error condition and calls `callbackContext.error(returnObj)` followed by a `return` statement. This suggests that if there's an error, the method exits early after reporting the error via the `callbackContext`.

2. The conflict region (`<<<<<<< HEAD` to `>>>>>>> 2efc89dde2658f518e6b6ca936296c207e08d65c`) indicates that one side (`HEAD`) has some content (though in this case, it's empty or a blank line), and the other side has removed whatever was there or simply has nothing.

3. After the conflict region, there's a call to `RemoveCallback(characteristicUuid, connection, operationWrite);`, followed by a check to see if `callbackContext` is `null`, and if so, it returns.

To resolve the conflict based on semantics and intent:

- The code before the conflict is handling an error condition and exiting.
- The presence of `RemoveCallback` after the conflict suggests that it is intended to remove a callback associated with a specific characteristic UUID, connection, and operation type.
- The check for `callbackContext == null` after `RemoveCallback` implies that the removal of the callback might be a precursor to checking if there's still a valid context to proceed.

Since the conflict region is essentially empty on both sides (with one side having a blank line), and there's no actual code change being merged or removed that's critical for the functionality (as the blank line doesn't affect the logic), we can choose to resolve this by simply removing the conflict markers. However, to preserve the original intent and spacing, we'll examine if removing or keeping the blank line (or the empty change) affects the logic.

The code snippet after resolving the conflict, preserving the original spacing and context, would be:

```java
          callbackContext.error(returnObj);
        }
        return;
      }

      RemoveCallback(characteristicUuid, connection, operationWrite);

      //If no callback, just return
      if (callbackContext == null) {
        return;
```

However, since there's no actual change in the conflicting region, and to keep with the instruction of not modifying the context, the resolution will directly remove the conflict markers.

Thus, the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax is:
```java
          callbackContext.error(returnObj);
        }
        return;
      }


      RemoveCallback(characteristicUuid, connection, operationWrite);

      //If no callback, just return
      if (callbackContext == null) {
        return;
```
