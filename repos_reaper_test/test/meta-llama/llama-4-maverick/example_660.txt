To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class given the presence of `setUp` (implied by the presence of `tearDown`) and the registration of a build listener. The conflict arises from the addition of a line in the branch being merged (`projectConfigurationManager = MavenPlugin.getProjectConfigurationManager();`) which is not present in the current HEAD.

Let's break down the steps and considerations:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The code sets up a build service, configures it with a JDK, creates a dummy Android build listener, and registers this listener. The `tearDown` method clears the listener.

2. **Analyzing the Conflict**: The conflict is about whether to include the line `projectConfigurationManager = MavenPlugin.getProjectConfigurationManager();` in the merged code.

3. **Intent and Semantics**: 
   - The main branch (HEAD) is focused on setting up a build environment with a specific JDK and registering a build listener.
   - The branch being merged introduces a project configuration manager, suggesting it might be necessary for the build or test setup.

4. **Resolving the Conflict**: 
   - If the introduction of `projectConfigurationManager` is necessary for the test or build setup and doesn't interfere with the existing setup (e.g., setting the JDK or registering the listener), it should be included.
   - The variable `projectConfigurationManager` is not used within the provided snippet, but it could be used elsewhere in the class.

Given that there's no indication that the introduced line conflicts with the existing code semantically or syntactically, and assuming that the branch being merged has a valid reason for introducing `projectConfigurationManager`, the resolution would be to include this line.

Here's the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
		buildService.setJdk(jdk);
		
		listener = new DummyAndroidBuildListener();

		registry.registerBuildListener(listener);
		projectConfigurationManager = MavenPlugin.getProjectConfigurationManager();
    }

	@Override
	protected void tearDown() throws Exception {
		listener.clear();
```
