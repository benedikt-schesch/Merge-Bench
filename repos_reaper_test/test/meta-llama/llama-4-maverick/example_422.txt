To resolve the merge conflict in the given Java code snippet, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is from the `org.jbake.template.model` package and involves imports necessary for the class or interface that follows. The merge conflict arises due to differing import statements between the two merging branches or commits.

1. The left side of the conflict (`HEAD`) includes the import statement for `org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty`.
2. The right side of the conflict (`1b5691ad2a7d734321d0382e71743a85835556b3`) includes the import statement for `org.jbake.model.DocumentModel`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider whether both imports are necessary, or if one is sufficient, or perhaps if there's an alternative that encompasses the intent of both.

Given the information available:
- `JBakeProperty` is related to configuration properties.
- `DocumentModel` is likely related to the model or representation of a document.

Without the actual code that follows these imports, we must infer based on typical use cases:
- If the class is dealing with both configuration properties and document models, it might need both imports.
- If the changes on both sides are independent (i.e., they don't directly relate to the same functionality or variable), both imports could be necessary.

Since there's no explicit indication that one import is more relevant than the other or that they are mutually exclusive, and given that they import different classes, the most straightforward resolution would be to include both imports.

Here's how we can resolve it:

```java
package org.jbake.template.model;

import org.jbake.app.ContentStore;
import org.jbake.app.DocumentList;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes;
import org.jbake.template.ModelExtractor;

import java.util.Map;


```

Let's return this resolution in the requested markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
package org.jbake.template.model;

import org.jbake.app.ContentStore;
import org.jbake.app.DocumentList;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes;
import org.jbake.template.ModelExtractor;

import java.util.Map;


```
