To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a constructor or an initialization block in a Java class. The context suggests that it's setting up a runtime environment for testing, possibly with the Infinitest framework, which is a continuous testing framework for Java.

The conflict arises between two different approaches to specifying the location of a filter file used for configuring TestNG and filtering tests.

1. **Left-hand side (HEAD)**: This version retrieves the filter file using a method `getFilterFile(environment)`, suggesting a more flexible or configurable approach to determining the filter file's location. It then uses this file to initialize both a `RegexFileFilter` (stored in `filterList`) and a `TestNGConfigurator`.

2. **Right-hand side (3df3b40acb25cbd0cde24cc0fc6f8be6c0fac9b4)**: This version constructs the filter file's path directly within the code, using the `environment.getWorkingDirectory().getAbsolutePath()` followed by a hardcoded relative path (`"infinitest.filters"`). It then uses this constructed file path to initialize a `RegexFileFilter`.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind each approach:

- The left-hand side seems to allow for more flexibility in determining the filter file's location, potentially based on the environment.
- The right-hand side hardcodes the relative path to the filter file, making it straightforward but less flexible.

Since both sides are trying to achieve a similar goal (initializing `filterList` with a `RegexFileFilter`), but differ in how they determine the filter file's location, we should consider what is more appropriate or if there's a way to reconcile these approaches.

However, there's a discrepancy in that the left-hand side also initializes `testNGConfigurator` with the filter file, while the right-hand side does not. This discrepancy suggests that the right-hand side might be missing a crucial initialization step for `testNGConfigurator`, or it might be handling this differently elsewhere.

Given the information and focusing on the conflict resolution:

```java
    {
        checkNotNull(environment, "No runtime environment is configured. Maybe because the project has no jdk.");

        runtimeEnvironment = environment;
        this.eventQueue = eventQueue;
        File filterFile = getFilterFile(environment);
        filterList = new RegexFileFilter(filterFile);
        testNGConfigurator = new TestNGConfigurator(filterFile);
        runnerClass = MultiProcessRunner.class;
        controller = new SingleLockConcurrencyController();
    }

    /**
```

Or, alternatively, using the right-hand side's logic but ensuring that `testNGConfigurator` is also properly initialized:

```java
    {
        checkNotNull(environment, "No runtime environment is configured. Maybe because the project has no jdk.");

        runtimeEnvironment = environment;
        this.eventQueue = eventQueue;
        String filterFileLocation = environment.getWorkingDirectory().getAbsolutePath() + File.separator
                        + "infinitest.filters";
        File filterFile = new File(filterFileLocation);
        filterList = new RegexFileFilter(filterFile);
        testNGConfigurator = new TestNGConfigurator(filterFile);
        runnerClass = MultiProcessRunner.class;
        controller = new SingleLockConcurrencyController();
    }

    /**
```

Since the right-hand side does not initialize `testNGConfigurator` and assuming that this initialization is necessary, the most semantically correct resolution, preserving the intent of both sides where applicable, would be to use the second version.

Thus, the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax is:
```java
    {
        checkNotNull(environment, "No runtime environment is configured. Maybe because the project has no jdk.");

        runtimeEnvironment = environment;
        this.eventQueue = eventQueue;
        String filterFileLocation = environment.getWorkingDirectory().getAbsolutePath() + File.separator
                        + "infinitest.filters";
        File filterFile = new File(filterFileLocation);
        filterList = new RegexFileFilter(filterFile);
        testNGConfigurator = new TestNGConfigurator(filterFile);
        runnerClass = MultiProcessRunner.class;
        controller = new SingleLockConcurrencyController();
    }

    /**
