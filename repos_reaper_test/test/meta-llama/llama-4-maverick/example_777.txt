To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The given Java code snippet appears to be part of a class that handles RPC (Remote Procedure Call) requests, specifically for getting data from a table. The original code snippet before the merge conflict is:

```java
final GetRequest rpc = new GetRequest(0F, table, key);
rpc.family(family);
return rpc;
```

The merge conflict arises with the introduction of a new method in the incoming changes (from `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`):

```java
/** Returns true if this is actually an "Get" RPC. */
private boolean isGetRequest() {
  return (versions & EXIST_FLAG) == 0;
}
```

Let's analyze the intent behind both the original code and the incoming change.

1. **Original Code Intent**: The original code creates a `GetRequest` object with specific parameters, sets a column family for the request, and then returns this request object. The focus here is on constructing and returning a `GetRequest`.

2. **Incoming Change Intent**: The incoming change introduces a new private method `isGetRequest()` that checks whether a certain condition related to `versions` and `EXIST_FLAG` is met. This suggests the class might be handling different types of RPCs, and this method helps determine if the current object represents a "Get" RPC.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider where the new method should be placed. Since the new method is a private helper method, its placement within the class is somewhat flexible, but it should logically be related to other methods or variables it interacts with.

Given that there's no direct conflict in the code (i.e., the same lines are not modified on both sides), and assuming that the `isGetRequest()` method is a valid addition that doesn't interfere with the existing functionality, we can simply place the new method at the indicated position without altering the surrounding context.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
    final GetRequest rpc = new GetRequest(0F, table, key);
    rpc.family(family);
    return rpc;
  }

  /** Returns true if this is actually an "Get" RPC. */
  private boolean isGetRequest() {
    return (versions & EXIST_FLAG) == 0;
  }

  /**
   * Specifies a particular column family to get.
   * @param family The column family.
   * <strong>This byte array will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @return {@code this}, always.
```
