To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the context and the intents of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided appears to be part of a test or an example related to Pig, a high-level data processing language and framework that is part of the Apache Hadoop project. The code is written in Java and is used to execute a Pig script.

The conflict arises in the line where a `GruntParser` object is created. 

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));
=======
            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
>>>>>>> 2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea
```

The version from `HEAD` (the local changes) creates a `GruntParser` with a single argument, a `StringReader` object initialized with the `script`. 

The version from `2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea` (the changes from the other branch being merged) creates a `GruntParser` with two arguments: a `StringReader` object (similar to the `HEAD` version) and `myPig`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand what `myPig` represents and its significance in the context of `GruntParser`. `GruntParser` is a class used to parse Pig scripts. The addition of `myPig` in the constructor suggests that the parsing is now being done in the context of a specific `Pig` instance (`myPig`), potentially allowing for more customized or specific parsing based on the state or configuration of `myPig`.

Given the information and without modifying the context or spacing, if we assume that `myPig` is relevant and necessary for the `GruntParser` (as indicated by the changes from the other branch), the resolution would involve choosing the version that includes `myPig`. However, to do so, we should be certain that `myPig` is properly initialized and relevant in this context.

Since we are not modifying the context and are preserving the spacing as is, and assuming that the inclusion of `myPig` is the intended change (as it is part of the merge), the resolved snippet should reflect this.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "illustrate b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            myPig.getPigContext().getProperties().setProperty("pig.usenewlogicalplan", "true");
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
```
