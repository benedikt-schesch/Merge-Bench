To resolve this merge conflict, we need to analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The conflict is between two import statements:
```java
import static io.airlift.command.Cli.buildCli;
```
and
```java
import static io.airlift.command.SingleCommand.singleCommand;
```
The first import statement is related to building a CLI (Command-Line Interface) using the `Cli` class, while the second import statement is related to creating a single command using the `SingleCommand` class.

Without more context about how these imports are being used in the `HelpTest` class, it's difficult to determine the intent of the developers who made the changes on both sides of the merge. However, we can make an educated guess based on the class name `HelpTest` and the presence of a `@Test` annotation.

Since the conflict is in the import statements and not in the actual code, we can examine the code that follows to see if it provides any clues. Unfortunately, the code snippet is truncated, and we can't see how these imports are being used.

Given the information available, the best course of action would be to return the original snippet with the conflict, as the intent is ambiguous.

Here is the original snippet in markdown code syntax, unchanged and with preserved spacing:
```java
import io.airlift.command.command.CommandRemove;

import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;
