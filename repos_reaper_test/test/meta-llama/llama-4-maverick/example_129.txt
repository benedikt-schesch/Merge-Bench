To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class given the presence of `EasyMockTest`. The imports are primarily from the `org.apache.aurora` package, indicating it's part of the Aurora project, an Apache Mesos framework.

The merge conflict arises from the import statements, where the local (`HEAD`) branch has imported `BatchJobUpdateStrategy`, while the incoming change (`4e28e73bb83b75f1369a705d15c96e40fb7098e1`) has imported `CountSlaPolicy`.

To understand the intent behind both changes, let's consider what these imports could imply:

1. **`BatchJobUpdateStrategy` Import**: The presence of `BatchJobUpdateStrategy` suggests that the local branch is working with or testing update strategies for batch jobs. This could be related to how job updates are managed or rolled out in the Aurora framework.

2. **`CountSlaPolicy` Import**: The `CountSlaPolicy` import on the other hand implies that the incoming change is related to Service Level Agreement (SLA) policies that are based on count. This could be part of implementing or testing SLA policies within the Aurora framework.

Both imports seem relevant to different aspects of job management or SLA policies within the Aurora framework. Without further context on how these are used within the code, it's challenging to determine if one import is redundant or if they serve distinct purposes.

Given that there's no indication that these imports are mutually exclusive or that one negates the need for the other, and assuming both are necessary for their respective changes, the conflict should be resolved by including both imports.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
import org.apache.aurora.common.stats.Stats;
import org.apache.aurora.common.stats.StatsProvider;
import org.apache.aurora.common.testing.easymock.EasyMockTest;
import org.apache.aurora.common.util.Clock;
import org.apache.aurora.common.util.TruncatedBinaryBackoff;
import org.apache.aurora.gen.BatchJobUpdateStrategy;
import org.apache.aurora.gen.CountSlaPolicy;
import org.apache.aurora.gen.InstanceTaskConfig;
import org.apache.aurora.gen.JobUpdate;
import org.apache.aurora.gen.JobUpdateAction;
import org.apache.aurora.gen.JobUpdateEvent;
import org.apache.aurora.gen.JobUpdateInstructions;
```

If the subsequent code doesn't use both `BatchJobUpdateStrategy` and `CountSlaPolicy`, or if there's a logical conflict in their usage, that would need to be addressed separately. However, based on the information provided and focusing solely on the import statements, including both seems like the most semantically appropriate resolution.
