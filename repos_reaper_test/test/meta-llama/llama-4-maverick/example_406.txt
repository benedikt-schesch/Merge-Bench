To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the code snippet and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code is written in Java and appears to be part of an Android application, specifically within a fragment, given the presence of `getActivity()`. The method `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState)` is overridden, which is a lifecycle method called when the fragment is being saved, typically to handle configuration changes or when the fragment is put on the back stack.

Here's the snippet with the conflict:
```java
@Override
public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
    super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
    try {
        if (((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC().isConnected())
<<<<<<< HEAD
            outState.putString("player", Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer(((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC()).getDisplayName());
=======
            outState.putString("player", ((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC()
                    .getCurrentPlayer().getDisplayName());
>>>>>>> 467f0adf711b7a96412e01a8f7ba4a578559a3bb
        else
            outState.remove("player");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        if (Logger.LOG)
            Logger.log(e);
```

Let's analyze the changes:

1. **Left side (HEAD):** The code uses `Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer(((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC()).getDisplayName()` to get the display name of the current player. This suggests that `Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer` is being used to retrieve the current player, and then `getDisplayName()` is called on that player object.

2. **Right side (467f0adf711b7a96412e01a8f7ba4a578559a3bb):** The code uses `((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC().getCurrentPlayer().getDisplayName()` to achieve a similar outcome. Here, it directly calls `getCurrentPlayer()` on the `GC` (presumably a Google Play Games client or similar) object obtained from the `MainActivity`, and then gets the display name.

The key difference between the two approaches is how they retrieve the current player. The left side uses `Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer`, while the right side directly uses a `getCurrentPlayer` method on the games client object.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent and the semantics of both changes.

- If both sides are trying to achieve the same result (saving the current player's display name), and assuming that both `Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer` and the direct `getCurrentPlayer` method on the games client are valid and potentially different ways to achieve this, we should consider which one is the correct or preferred method.

- The right side of the conflict (using `((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC().getCurrentPlayer().getDisplayName()`) seems more direct and straightforward, assuming `getGC()` returns an object that has a `getCurrentPlayer()` method. This approach is more concise and potentially more efficient or straightforward if `getGC()` is the canonical way to access the games client.

Given the information and without further context on the deprecated status or differences between `Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer` and `getGC().getCurrentPlayer()`, the right side's change seems to be a simplification or a potentially more modern or recommended approach.

Therefore, resolving the conflict by choosing the right side's change:
```java
@Override
public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
    super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
    try {
        if (((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC().isConnected())
            outState.putString("player", ((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC()
                    .getCurrentPlayer().getDisplayName());
        else
            outState.remove("player");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        if (Logger.LOG)
            Logger.log(e);
```
