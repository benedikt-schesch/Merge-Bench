To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made in both branches.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a larger method or class responsible for configuring or collecting information (`collectInfo`) related to an application. The snippet deals with setting an application path based on certain conditions.

The conflict arises in the lines where the code retrieves the `ApplicationPath` annotation from the `application` class. 

Let's analyze the conflicting changes:

1. The code on the left side of the conflict (`HEAD`) is:
   ```java
ApplicationPath applicationPath = application.getClass()
        .getAnnotation(ApplicationPath.class);
```
   This line retrieves the `ApplicationPath` annotation from the `application` class. The method call is split over two lines.

2. The code on the right side of the conflict (`1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f`) is:
   ```java
ApplicationPath applicationPath = application.getClass().getAnnotation(
        ApplicationPath.class);
```
   This achieves the same result as the left side but formats the method call differently, with the opening parenthesis on the same line as `getAnnotation` and the argument on the next line.

Both versions of the code are semantically equivalent; they achieve the same outcome. The difference lies in the formatting.

Given that the intent is the same on both sides (to get the `ApplicationPath` annotation from the `application` class), and the difference is purely in code formatting, we can resolve the conflict by choosing one formatting style over the other.

To preserve the original spacing as is and not modify the context, and considering the difference is just about code formatting, the conflict can be resolved by selecting one of the versions. Let's choose the version from `HEAD` for consistency with the surrounding code formatting (though the choice between the two is arbitrary due to their semantic equivalence).

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
                .setUseSectionNamingPackageStrategy(useSectionNamingPackageStrategy);

        if (baseRef != null) {
            collectInfo.setApplicationPath(baseRef.getPath());
        } else if (application != null) {
            ApplicationPath applicationPath = application.getClass()
                    .getAnnotation(ApplicationPath.class);
            if (applicationPath != null) {
                collectInfo.setApplicationPath(applicationPath.value());
            }
        }
