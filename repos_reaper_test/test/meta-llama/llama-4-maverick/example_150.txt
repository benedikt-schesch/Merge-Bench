To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the conflict.

The code snippet appears to be part of a test or an example involving Apache Pig, a high-level data processing language and framework. The `script` variable contains a Pig Latin script that is being executed or parsed. The conflict arises when creating an instance of `GruntParser`, a class used to parse Pig Latin scripts.

On the `HEAD` side (the local changes), the `GruntParser` is instantiated with a single argument: `new StringReader(script)`. This suggests that the script is being parsed from a string.

On the other side of the merge (represented by the commit `2125666c1941d4a88c08ab87ebf92ee46be4f0ea`), the `GruntParser` is instantiated with two arguments: `new StringReader(script)` and `myPig`. The addition of `myPig` implies that some context or configuration related to Pig ( potentially a `PigServer` or similar) is being passed to the parser.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. The `HEAD` side is using a straightforward way to parse the script, suggesting that the default or existing configuration for Pig is sufficient. The other side is passing an additional context (`myPig`), which could imply that the parsing needs to be done with a specific configuration or setup represented by `myPig`.

Given the information, if `myPig` represents a necessary context or configuration for the parser (for example, a specific PigServer instance that is required for parsing or executing the script), then its inclusion is likely important for the functionality being added or modified on the other branch.

Therefore, the resolution would be to include both necessary components: parsing the script from a string and using the `myPig` context. The conflict resolution involves choosing the version that includes `myPig` in the `GruntParser` constructor if it's deemed necessary for the functionality.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "illustrate b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();

```
