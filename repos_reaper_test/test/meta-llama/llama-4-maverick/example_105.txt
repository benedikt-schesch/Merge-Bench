To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the provided code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a test class due to the presence of JUnit imports and annotations. The conflict arises from different import statements being added in the two branches being merged.

First, let's examine the changes:

- The `HEAD` (local) branch has imports that include a static import for all (`*`) from `junit.framework.Assert`, `org.fest.test.ErrorMessages`, and `org.fest.test.ExpectedException`. 
- The other branch (`06e86330876dee7fcb1356794176b04a7161cf65`) has more specific static imports from `junit.framework.Assert` (importing `assertEquals` and `assertSame`) and does not initially include the import for `descriptionIsNull` from `org.fest.test.ErrorMessages` or `none` from `org.fest.test.ExpectedException`.

However, upon closer inspection, it's noticeable that the second part of the imports (after the conflict markers) includes both the specific imports from `junit.framework.Assert` (as in the other branch) and the imports from `org.fest.test.ErrorMessages` and `org.fest.test.ExpectedException` (as in the `HEAD` branch), effectively combining the necessary imports.

To resolve the conflict semantically:

1. The `HEAD` branch seems to be importing everything (`*`) from `junit.framework.Assert`, which is not necessary if we are to follow the more explicit import style introduced in the other branch.
2. The other branch has refined the imports from `junit.framework.Assert` to be more specific (`assertEquals` and `assertSame`), which is generally considered good practice as it avoids polluting the namespace with unnecessary imports.

The resolution involves choosing the imports that are necessary for the class. Since the combined import section after the conflict markers includes all necessary imports without importing everything (`*`) from `junit.framework.Assert`, it seems like a reasonable resolution.

Thus, the resolved code snippet, preserving the original formatting and context, should be returned as is, with the conflict markers removed to reflect the combination of necessary imports.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:
