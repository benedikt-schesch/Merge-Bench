To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a class, likely used in an Android application given the presence of `LayoutInflater` and the database-related operations. The snippet is retrieving column indices from a database cursor for various fields related to a status update ( possibly from Twitter, given the mention of `TwitterDbAdapter`).

The conflict arises in the line where it attempts to retrieve the column index for a field related to whether a status has been favorited. The two versions are:
- `TwitterDbAdapter.KEY_FAVORITED` (from the `HEAD` side, presumably the local changes or the branch being merged into).
- `StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED` (from the other side of the merge, `9734ffd77100479d84522d730522fefa5d6e8522`, presumably changes from the branch being merged).

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes.

1. **`TwitterDbAdapter.KEY_FAVORITED`**: This suggests that the favorited status is being retrieved using a key defined in `TwitterDbAdapter`. It implies that `TwitterDbAdapter` is a class that manages or provides constants for database operations related to Twitter data.

2. **`StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED`**: This indicates that the favorited status is retrieved using a field name defined in `StatusTable`. `StatusTable` likely represents a database table for storing status updates, and `FIELD_FAVORITED` is a constant representing the column name for the favorited status.

Both `TwitterDbAdapter.KEY_FAVORITED` and `StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED` seem to be related to the same functionality - indicating whether a status is favorited. The difference lies in where the constant for the column name is defined.

Without more context about the structure of the database or the classes `TwitterDbAdapter` and `StatusTable`, the most straightforward resolution is to choose one based on consistency and convention within the project.

If `StatusTable` is used consistently throughout the project to define field names for the status table, and there's a movement towards encapsulating table-specific field names within their respective table classes, then `StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED` is likely the more consistent and future-proof choice.

Conversely, if `TwitterDbAdapter` is a legacy or primary adapter for Twitter-related data and its constants are used throughout the codebase for historical or design reasons, then `TwitterDbAdapter.KEY_FAVORITED` might be the way to go.

Since the change in the other branch (`StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED`) seems to be using a more specific and possibly more modern or consistent naming convention (`StatusTable.FIELD_*` is used for other fields as well), and assuming that `StatusTable` is a class that defines the structure or constants for the status table, it makes sense to align with this convention for consistency.

Therefore, the resolved code snippet should be:
```java
			mSourceColumn = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_SOURCE);
			mInReplyToScreenName = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_IN_REPLY_TO_SCREEN_NAME);
			mFavorited = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED);
		} 
		mMetaBuilder = new StringBuilder();
	}

	private LayoutInflater mInflater;
