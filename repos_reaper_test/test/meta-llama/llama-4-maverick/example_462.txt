To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class given the presence of JUnit annotations (`@Test`, `@Rule`) and a testing framework (JenkinsRule). The snippet includes import statements for various classes and static imports for assertion methods.

The merge conflict is on the import statements, specifically around the introduction of `org.junit.Before` import.

Let's analyze the changes:
- The local changes (represented by `HEAD`) did not introduce any new import statements related to JUnit lifecycle methods (like `@Before`).
- The incoming changes (represented by the commit hash `1e8c07a4ea963bc19dccd51b5d39ee814bd37f0b`) introduce an import statement for `org.junit.Before`.

The intent behind the incoming change seems to be preparing for the addition of a method annotated with `@Before`, which is a JUnit annotation indicating a method to be executed before each test. This suggests that the incoming changes are likely adding a setup or initialization method necessary for the tests.

Since there's no overlap or direct conflict in the changes (the local and incoming changes are modifying different parts of the import section), and assuming that introducing the `@Before` method is a valid and necessary change for the test class, we can resolve the conflict by keeping both sets of import statements.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:
