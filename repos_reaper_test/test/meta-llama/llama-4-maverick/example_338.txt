To resolve this merge conflict, we need to carefully examine the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of an Android application, given the use of Android-specific classes like `Menu` and `MenuItem`. The method `onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu)` is a callback used in Android Activities to populate the options menu.

The conflict arises in the lines where a `MenuItem` is added to the `menu`. Specifically, the conflict is over the string resource used for the title of the menu item with the ID `OPTIONS_MENU_ID_DM`.

```java
  }


  @Override
  public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    MenuItem item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_DM, 0, R.string.page_title_direct_messages);
=======
    MenuItem item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_DM, 0, R.string.cmenu_direct_message);
>>>>>>> ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62
    item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_send);

    item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_FOLLOW, 0, R.string.user_label_follow);
    item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_add);
```

Let's analyze the changes:
- The version from `HEAD` uses `R.string.page_title_direct_messages` for the menu item's title.
- The version from `ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62` uses `R.string.cmenu_direct_message`.

The intent behind both changes seems to be to set a meaningful title for the menu item related to direct messages. 

To resolve the conflict, we need to decide which string resource better fits the intent of the menu item or if there's a way to reconcile both changes.

Without more context about the specific requirements of the application or the exact meaning of these string resources, the most straightforward resolution would be to choose one of the two options based on their semantic meaning.

- `R.string.page_title_direct_messages` suggests it might be used as a title for a page or section related to direct messages, which could be appropriate for a menu item if it's meant to lead to that section.
- `R.string.cmenu_direct_message` implies it's used for a context menu (or possibly an options menu in this case) related to direct messaging, which could be a more specific action or a label for an item that initiates direct messaging.

Given that both seem plausible and without further context on which is more appropriate or if there's a functional difference between them in the app's UI, a safe resolution might be to pick one that is more likely to be correct based on naming conventions.

However, the best course of action would be to understand the application's requirements or consult with the developers who made the changes.

Since the conflict involves choosing between two potentially valid string resources and there's no clear indication that one is definitively better than the other without more context, I'll return the snippet as is, preserving the conflict markers.

```java
  }


  @Override
  public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    MenuItem item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_DM, 0, R.string.page_title_direct_messages);
=======
    MenuItem item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_DM, 0, R.string.cmenu_direct_message);
>>>>>>> ddf3e5fca3fad4fa766685157302c0b7b11ade62
    item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_send);

    item = menu.add(0, OPTIONS_MENU_ID_FOLLOW, 0, R.string.user_label_follow);
    item.setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_menu_add);
```
