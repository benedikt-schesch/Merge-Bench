To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles notifications, possibly in an Android application given the use of `PendingIntent` and the `R.drawable` resource references.

The conflict arises in the lines related to calling a `notify` method, which is presumably used to display a notification to the user. The `notify` method takes several parameters, including a `PendingIntent`, a notification ID, a drawable resource ID, and some text to be displayed in the notification.

Let's analyze the changes:

1. The left-hand side (HEAD) of the merge conflict uses `R.drawable.notify_mentions` as the drawable resource and `latestTweet.text` as the text to be used directly in the `notify` method.
   
2. The right-hand side (f977f63c0c0331b415e90b37d1c3b44ad214144b) uses `R.drawable.notify_mention` (a different drawable resource) and `Utils.getSimpleTweetText(latestTweet.text)` (a processed version of `latestTweet.text`) as the text.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both changes:

- The change in the drawable resource from `notify_mentions` to `notify_mention` could be due to a correction or standardization in the resource naming convention.
  
- The change from using `latestTweet.text` directly to using `Utils.getSimpleTweetText(latestTweet.text)` suggests an intent to simplify or process the tweet text before displaying it in the notification.

Given these observations, a resolution that respects both intents could involve using the processed text (`Utils.getSimpleTweetText(latestTweet.text)`) and the corrected drawable resource (`R.drawable.notify_mention`), as these changes seem to be improvements or refinements to the original code.

Here's the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
		}

		PendingIntent intent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0,
				MentionActivity.createIntent(this), 0);

		notify(intent, MENTION_NOTIFICATION_ID, R.drawable.notify_mention,
				Utils.getSimpleTweetText(latestTweet.text), title, text);
	}

	private static int TWEET_NOTIFICATION_ID = 0;
	private static int DM_NOTIFICATION_ID = 1;
	private static int MENTION_NOTIFICATION_ID = 2;
```

This resolution assumes that both changes are intended to be part of the final code. If there's any ambiguity or if the changes conflict in a way that isn't resolvable through simple observation, it would be best to review the commit history or consult with the developers involved in the changes. However, based on the information provided, the above resolution seems to be a reasonable merge of the two conflicting changes.
