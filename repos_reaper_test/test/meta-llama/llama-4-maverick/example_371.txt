To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a larger system responsible for initiating a request to upload content, potentially to a server. The content can be either multipart (including metadata and media content) or just media. The `initiationRequestUrl` is being populated with parameters depending on the type of content and other conditions.

The conflict arises in the `else` block where the `uploadType` is set to `"media"`. Here, the two versions of the code differ in how they handle the `contentOffset` parameter.

1. The version from `HEAD` (the local changes) checks if `contentOffset` is not equal to `-1` before adding it to `initiationRequestUrl`. This suggests that `-1` is being used as a sentinel value to indicate that `contentOffset` should not be included in the request.

2. The version from `2b9e9a2c04fcb8b3b93d3207f547f6f95bf681e9` (the changes being merged in) directly adds `contentOffset` to `initiationRequestUrl` without checking its value.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to understand the intent behind both changes.

- If the intent is to always include `contentOffset` when `uploadType` is `"media"`, regardless of its value, then the change from `2b9e9a2c04fcb8b3b93d3207f547f6f95bf681e9` is correct. However, this could potentially lead to issues if `-1` is expected to be handled differently.

- If the intent is to include `contentOffset` only when it is not `-1`, suggesting that `-1` has a special meaning (like "not specified" or "invalid"), then the `HEAD` version is correct.

Without additional context on how `contentOffset` is used or its expected values, the safest resolution is to preserve the logic that handles `-1` as a special case, as it likely indicates a specific condition or error handling.

However, since the task is to return the snippet as is if the intent is ambiguous, and given that we are not explicitly resolving the conflict but rather returning the code in markdown syntax while preserving the conflict if the intent is not clear, the correct approach is to return the original snippet with the conflict.

```java
    if (metadata != null) {
      content = new MultipartContent().setContentParts(Arrays.asList(metadata, mediaContent));
      initiationRequestUrl.put("uploadType", "multipart");
    } else {
      initiationRequestUrl.put("uploadType", "media");
<<<<<<< HEAD
      if (contentOffset != -1) {
        initiationRequestUrl.put("contentOffset", String.valueOf(contentOffset));
      }
=======
      initiationRequestUrl.put("contentOffset", String.valueOf(contentOffset));
>>>>>>> 2b9e9a2c04fcb8b3b93d3207f547f6f95bf681e9
    }
    HttpRequest request =
        requestFactory.buildRequest(initiationRequestMethod, initiationRequestUrl, content);
    request.getHeaders().putAll(initiationHeaders);
    // We do not have to do anything special here if media content length is unspecified because
