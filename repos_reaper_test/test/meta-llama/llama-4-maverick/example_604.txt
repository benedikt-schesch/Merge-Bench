To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a Java class representing a Facebook Page, utilizing annotations from a library like RestFB for mapping Facebook Graph API responses to Java objects. The field in question is related to the number of likes a page has.

On the left-hand side (HEAD), the field is annotated with `@Facebook("likes")` and is named `likesCount`. The annotation specifies that this field corresponds to the "likes" property in the Facebook Graph API response.

On the right-hand side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe), the field is annotated with `@Facebook` (without specifying a property name) and is named `likes`.

The `@Facebook` annotation without a specified property name typically implies that the Java field name matches the property name in the Facebook Graph API response. 

The intent on both sides seems to be to represent the number of likes a page has. However, they differ in how they map the Facebook API property to the Java field and in the naming of the field.

To resolve this conflict, we must choose the correct field name and annotation that accurately represent the data and are consistent with the surrounding code and project conventions.

Upon closer inspection, it seems that `likesCount` is a more descriptive name for the count of likes, and specifying `@Facebook("likes")` explicitly maps it to the "likes" property in the Facebook API, which could be considered more clear and explicit.

However, without more context on the project's conventions or the specific Facebook API property being mapped, it's challenging to definitively choose between the two versions.

Given the information and focusing on clarity and explicitness, the resolution could lean towards the left-hand side version for its explicit mapping. Nonetheless, we should preserve the conflict if the intent is ambiguous or not clearly resolvable based on the given context.

Here is the snippet returned in markdown code syntax as provided, without modifications to the context or spacing:
