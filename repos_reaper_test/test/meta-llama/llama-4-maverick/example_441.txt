To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the code snippet and understand the intent of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles UI components, specifically focusing on certain fields and setting up listeners.

The conflict arises in the `focusOnField` method. The left side of the conflict (`HEAD`) has a version of `focusOnField` that takes a single `CreditEntryFieldBase` parameter and updates the helper text using `this.textHelper.setText(field.getHelperText());` if `this.textHelper` is not null.

The right side of the conflict (`23596e40a6165aa475ca6c20af17496809559474`) seems to be calling an overloaded version of `focusOnField` that takes an additional `String` parameter (`initialFieldValue`), passing `null` for this additional parameter.

Looking at the overloaded `focusOnField` method that takes two parameters, it requests focus on the given field and then checks if the component is currently scrolling. If not, it sets `scrolling` to `true`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions. The original code (left side) updates the helper text when focusing on a field. The change on the right side redirects the call to an overloaded method that handles focusing and potentially more, but it loses the helper text update functionality.

If the intent is to both update the helper text and call the overloaded method for additional functionality (like requesting focus and handling scrolling), we could potentially call the overloaded `focusOnField` method from the single-parameter version, after updating the helper text.

However, directly resolving this requires making assumptions about the desired behavior. Let's analyze further:

1. The single-parameter `focusOnField` method is being modified or replaced.
2. The right side introduces a call to an overloaded method, suggesting that this overloaded method (`focusOnField(field, null)`) is the newer or preferred way to handle focusing on a field.

Given the information and sticking to the task requirements, the resolution should be done by considering the semantic intent.

```java
        securityCodeText.setOnFocusChangeListener(l);
        zipCodeText.setOnFocusChangeListener(l);
    }

    public void focusOnField(final CreditEntryFieldBase field) {
        if (this.textHelper != null) {
            this.textHelper.setText(field.getHelperText());
        }
        focusOnField(field, null);
    }

    public void focusOnField(final CreditEntryFieldBase field, String initialFieldValue) {
        field.requestFocus();
        if(!scrolling) {
            scrolling = true;
```
