To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a test class, given the presence of the `@Test` annotation. The test method `checkIterator_reachAllElements` is designed to verify that an iterator (in this case, related to a `Connection` object that seems to be part of a Facebook API or a similar service) iterates over all elements as expected.

The conflict arises in the assertion following the creation of a `Connection` object named `connection`. 

On one side of the merge (`HEAD`), the assertion is made using `assertThat(connection).isNotNull();`, which is a statement from a fluent assertion library, likely AssertJ.

On the other side of the merge (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`), the assertion is made using `assertNotNull(connection);`, which is a method typically found in JUnit's assertion library.

Both assertions are semantically equivalent; they check if the `connection` object is not null. The difference lies in the assertion library being used.

To resolve this conflict, we need to decide which assertion style to keep. Since both are functionally equivalent and the intent is the same (to ensure `connection` is not null), we can choose either one based on the project's assertion library preference or coding standards.

However, without additional context on the preferred assertion library or coding standards of the project, the most straightforward resolution is to choose one of the assertions.

Let's preserve the original snippet and resolve the conflict by choosing the assertion from `HEAD`, which uses the AssertJ library. Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_reachAllElements() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();

    assertThat(connection).isNotNull();

    int counter = 0;
    for (List<FacebookType> page : connection) {
      for (FacebookType type : page) {
        counter++;
```
