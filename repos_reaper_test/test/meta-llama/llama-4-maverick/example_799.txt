To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles deserialization of objects, specifically in the context of HBase RPC (Remote Procedure Call) requests and responses. The method in question, `deserializeObject`, is responsible for de-serializing a "Writable" object that was previously serialized by `HbaseObjectWritable#writeObject`.

The conflict arises from differences in the method signature between the two versions being merged:

1. The version from `HEAD` (the current branch) has a method signature that includes three parameters: `final ChannelBuffer buf`, `final int rpcid`, and `final HBaseRpc request`. The `rpcid` is an integer parameter that seems to be related to the RPC request ID.

2. The version from the commit `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` (the other branch being merged) has a method signature with two parameters: `final ChannelBuffer buf` and `final HBaseRpc request`. Notably, this version removes the `rpcid` parameter and makes the method `static`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind the changes on both sides:

- The removal of `rpcid` and making the method `static` in the other branch (`d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f`) suggests that the `rpcid` is no longer needed for deserialization, and the method can be used without an instance of the class.

- The original method in `HEAD` includes `rpcid`, suggesting it was used or potentially used in the deserialization process or for other logic within the method.

Given the information and the code snippet, the method's body does not reference `rpcid`, which implies that the change made in the other branch (removing `rpcid`) is likely correct or at least does not affect the functionality within the provided snippet. However, making the method `static` is a significant change that could affect how this method is used or accessed within the class or from other classes.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent of both changes (if possible), we should examine if `rpcid` is used elsewhere in the method or class. Since the provided snippet does not show its usage, and assuming it's not crucial for the deserialization logic shown, we can consider aligning with the change that removes `rpcid`. However, we must be cautious about making the method `static` as it changes the method's accessibility and usage.

Let's analyze the given code snippet and the changes:

```java
   * De-serializes a "Writable" serialized by
   * {@code HbaseObjectWritable#writeObject}.
   * @return The de-serialized object (which can be {@code null}).
   */
  @SuppressWarnings("fallthrough")
<<<<<<< HEAD
  Object deserializeObject(final ChannelBuffer buf,
                           final int rpcid,
                           final HBaseRpc request) {
=======
  static Object deserializeObject(final ChannelBuffer buf,
                                  final HBaseRpc request) {
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    switch (buf.readByte()) {  // Read the type of the response.
      case  1:  // Boolean
        return buf.readByte() != 0x00;
      case  6:  // Long
        return buf.readLong();
```

Since `rpcid` is not used within the provided snippet, and assuming the rest of the method's body (not shown) also does not use it, the change that removes `rpcid` is likely safe. However, the decision to make the method `static` should be based on whether the method is intended to be an instance method or not.

To resolve the conflict, we will choose the version that removes `rpcid` and keeps the method non-static, as we cannot be certain about the implications of making it `static` without more context.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
   * De-serializes a "Writable" serialized by
   * {@code HbaseObjectWritable#writeObject}.
   * @return The de-serialized object (which can be {@code null}).
   */
  @SuppressWarnings("fallthrough")
  Object deserializeObject(final ChannelBuffer buf,
                           final HBaseRpc request) {
    switch (buf.readByte()) {  // Read the type of the response.
      case  1:  // Boolean
        return buf.readByte() != 0x00;
      case  6:  // Long
        return buf.readLong();
```
