To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The code snippet is written in Java and is testing the functionality of a `ConnectionIterator`. The test seems to be checking if the iterator correctly handles the case when it has reached the end of the available pages (i.e., when `hasNext()` returns `false`).

The merge conflict arises from differences in how the test expects to handle the case when `next()` is called after `hasNext()` has returned `false`. Let's examine both versions:

1. **Left-hand side (HEAD):**
   - It uses `assertThat(it.hasNext()).isFalse();` to assert that the iterator does not have a next element.
   - It then calls `it.next()` and expects a `NoSuchElementException` to be thrown, which is verified by `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(NoSuchElementException.class);`.

2. **Right-hand side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe):**
   - It uses `assertFalse(it.hasNext());` to assert the same condition as the left-hand side.
   - Similarly, it calls `it.next()` after asserting that there are no more elements.
   - However, it uses `fail(NoSuchElementException.class.getName());` to indicate that the test should fail if a `NoSuchElementException` is not thrown.

Semantically, both sides are testing the same behavior: they check that calling `next()` on an iterator after it has been exhausted results in a `NoSuchElementException`. The differences are in the assertion style and the failure handling.

- The left-hand side uses a more fluent assertion style (`assertThat` vs `assertFalse`), which is part of a testing library (likely AssertJ).
- The right-hand side uses JUnit's built-in `assertFalse` and a different way to indicate that an exception was expected.

To resolve this conflict, one needs to consider the overall testing style used in the project. If the project predominantly uses AssertJ for assertions, the left-hand side's approach is more consistent. If JUnit assertions are preferred, the right-hand side's style is more appropriate.

Given that both approaches are semantically equivalent in terms of testing intent, we can choose one based on the project's testing style. Let's pick the left-hand side's version for consistency with a potentially broader use of AssertJ in the project.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
    ConnectionIterator<FacebookType> it = connection.iterator();
    it.next(); // first page
    it.next(); // second page
    it.next(); // third and last page

    assertThat(it.hasNext()).isFalse();
    it.next();
    failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(NoSuchElementException.class);
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_withCursor() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = createCursorConnection();
```
