To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that utilizes the RestFB library for interacting with Facebook's API. The imports at the top are bringing in various utility functions and classes from RestFB.

The merge conflict arises from differing import statements between the `HEAD` (typically representing the current branch or the local changes) and the commit `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` (representing the incoming changes, usually from another branch or a remote repository).

Looking at the conflict:

- The `HEAD` side imports `com.restfb.json.JsonObject` and `com.restfb.json.ParseException`.
- The `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` side imports a broader range of exceptions from `com.restfb.exception.*`, `com.restfb.json.JsonException` (instead of `ParseException`), and `com.restfb.json.JsonObject`.

The intent behind the `HEAD` side seems to be focused on importing specific JSON-related classes.

The intent behind the `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` side appears to be adding imports for various exceptions that could be thrown by RestFB, potentially indicating an effort to handle a wider range of exceptions, and it also imports `JsonObject`. The use of `JsonException` instead of `ParseException` might suggest a change in how JSON parsing errors are handled.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to consider what the class is intended to do and what imports are necessary for its functionality.

1. The class is using `JsonObject`, so this import is necessary.
2. The `HEAD` side specifically imports `ParseException`, suggesting it might be used for handling parsing errors. However, the other side imports a range of exceptions (`com.restfb.exception.*`) and `JsonException`, which could be more comprehensive in handling potential errors, including JSON parsing issues.

Since both sides are importing `JsonObject`, this part is not conflicting in terms of intent. The conflict lies in the additional imports.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent of both sides, we can include all necessary imports. The `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` side's imports seem to be more comprehensive, covering a broader range of potential exceptions. Thus, we can merge the imports in a way that includes all unique imports from both sides.

Here is the resolution:

```java
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.isBlank;
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.trimToEmpty;
import static com.restfb.util.UrlUtils.urlEncode;
import static java.util.Arrays.asList;

import com.restfb.exception.*;
import com.restfb.json.JsonException;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
import com.restfb.json.ParseException;

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Map.Entry;
import java.util.Set;
```

This resolution includes all the imports from both sides, ensuring that the class has access to all the necessary classes and exceptions. Note that having both `JsonException` and `ParseException` might be redundant if they serve similar purposes or if one is a subclass of the other, but without further context on their usage within the class, it's safer to include both.

The final resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context, is as follows:

```java
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.isBlank;
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.trimToEmpty;
import static com.restfb.util.UrlUtils.urlEncode;
import static java.util.Arrays.asList;

import com.restfb.exception.*;
import com.restfb.json.JsonException;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
import com.restfb.json.ParseException;

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Map.Entry;
import java.util.Set;
```
