To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made in both branches.

The provided Java test method, `postImageToPagePhotosWithMessage`, is used to test the functionality of posting an image to a Facebook page's photos with a message. The method uses the Facebook API client to publish the image.

The conflict arises due to differences in the Facebook API version used in the `DefaultFacebookClient` constructor. The two versions in conflict are `Version.VERSION_2_5` and `Version.VERSION_2_2`.

Let's analyze the intents:
- The code in the `HEAD` ( likely the main or master branch or the branch being merged into) uses `Version.VERSION_2_5`, indicating an intent to use a potentially more recent or stable version of the Facebook API at the time of its implementation.
- The incoming change (from the branch being merged, identified by the commit hash `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) uses `Version.VERSION_2_2`, suggesting an intent to use an older version of the Facebook API.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider which Facebook API version is more appropriate for the functionality being tested. 

Since `Version.VERSION_2_5` is a later version than `Version.VERSION_2_2`, it is likely that `Version.VERSION_2_5` is the preferred or more tested version, unless there's a specific reason to use the older `Version.VERSION_2_2` (like compatibility issues with newer versions or specific features available only in the older version).

Without more context on why `Version.VERSION_2_2` is being used, the most straightforward resolution is to choose one based on the assumption that the more recent version is being used for a reason (like being more stable, secure, or feature-rich).

However, the test's intent is not explicitly dependent on the version's features but rather on successfully posting an image. Both versions should theoretically support this basic functionality.

Given the information and focusing on the semantic intent:
- If the intent is to ensure compatibility or test with a specific version for a valid reason, the choice should reflect that.
- If there's no specific reason to prefer `Version.VERSION_2_2` over `Version.VERSION_2_5`, or vice versa, based on the provided context, we cannot conclusively determine the best resolution without potentially altering the intent.

Therefore, without additional context or a clear reason to prefer one version over the other, the conflict should be left as is to be resolved by a developer who understands the specific requirements or constraints of the project.

Here is the code snippet preserved in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java

  @Test
  public void postImageToPagePhotosWithMessage() {
    byte[] imageAsBytes = fetchBytesFromImage();
    DefaultFacebookClient client =
<<<<<<< HEAD
        new DefaultFacebookClient(getTestSettings().getPageAccessToken(), Version.VERSION_2_5);
=======
        new DefaultFacebookClient(getTestSettings().getPageAccessToken(), Version.VERSION_2_2);
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    JsonObject obj = client.publish(getTestSettings().getPageId() + "/photos", JsonObject.class,
      BinaryAttachment.with("test.png", imageAsBytes, "image/png"), Parameter.with("message", "TestImage"),
      Parameter.with("no_story", "true"));
    assertNotNull(obj);
  }

```
