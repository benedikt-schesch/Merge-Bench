To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is from a test setup method (`setUp`) in a Java test class. It initializes several mock objects using `createMock` and creates a new instance of the `Game` class, passing various parameters to its constructor.

The conflict arises from the different number of parameters passed to the `Game` constructor in the two versions of the code.

### Analyzing the Conflict

1. **Left side of the conflict (`<<<<<<< HEAD`)**: The `Game` constructor is called with 10 parameters. The last four parameters are `falseProvider`, `formatProvider`, `falseProvider`, and `formatProvider`.

2. **Right side of the conflict (`>>>>>>> ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967`)**: The `Game` constructor is called with 11 parameters. The last five parameters are `formatProvider`, `falseProvider`, `formatProvider`, `falseProvider`, and `gameOptionsProvider`.

### Understanding the Intent

- The left side seems to be using a version of the `Game` constructor that accepts 10 parameters, with the last four being providers or formatters related to game settings or rules.
- The right side is using a version that presumably accepts 11 parameters, adding an additional `gameOptionsProvider` at the end.

### Resolving the Conflict

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the `Game` constructor and the significance of the additional parameter on the right side (`gameOptionsProvider`).

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The addition of `gameOptionsProvider` on the right side suggests that the `Game` class has been modified to accept additional game options, potentially making the game configuration more flexible.

2. **Potential Resolution**: If the intent is to incorporate the `gameOptionsProvider` into the test setup (as suggested by the right side of the conflict), and assuming that the `Game` class constructor on the left side is outdated or not compatible with the current test requirements, we should align the test setup with the updated `Game` class constructor.

However, without knowing the exact changes to the `Game` class and its constructor, we cannot be certain whether the left or the right side (or a different resolution altogether) is correct.

### Return Snippet

Given the potential ambiguity in resolving the conflict without further context on the `Game` class constructor and its parameters, the safest approach is to return the original snippet with the conflict, as modifying it without clear understanding might introduce incorrect assumptions.

```java
  public void setUp() {
    cuMock = createMock(ConnectedUsers.class);
    gmMock = createMock(GameManager.class);
    metricsMock = createMock(Metrics.class);
    game = new Game(0, cuMock, gmMock, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
<<<<<<< HEAD
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider);
