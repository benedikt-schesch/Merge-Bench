To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class, given the presence of the `@Test` annotation. The test method `sanitizeTags` seems to be checking the functionality of sanitizing tags in a document processing context.

The conflict arises in the `sanitizeTags` test method. The changes on both sides of the conflict are as follows:

- On the left side (`HEAD`), the code sets a property named `JBakeProperty.TAG_SANITIZE` to `true` in the `config` object and then processes a file using `parser.processFile`, storing the result in a `DocumentModel` object named `map`.
- On the right side (`d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb`), the code sets a property using `TAG_SANITIZE.getKey()` as the key to `true` in the `config` object. It then processes the same file, but the result is stored in a `Map<String, Object>` named `map`.

The intent behind both changes seems to be related to how configuration properties are accessed and how the result of processing a file is handled.

1. **Configuration Property Access**: The left side uses `JBakeProperty.TAG_SANITIZE` directly, while the right side uses `TAG_SANITIZE.getKey()`. The change on the right side suggests a possible refactoring where `TAG_SANITIZE` is an enum or an object that encapsulates the property key, potentially making the code more type-safe or easier to maintain.

2. **Type of `map` Object**: The left side declares `map` as a `DocumentModel`, whereas the right side declares it as a `Map<String, Object>`. This change could reflect a modification in the return type of `parser.processFile` or a change in how the result is expected to be handled.

To resolve this conflict, we should consider the intent and the semantics of both changes.

- If the refactoring on the right side (`TAG_SANITIZE.getKey()`) is part of a larger effort to standardize or improve property access, and if `parser.processFile` now returns a `Map<String, Object>` (or if it's intended to be treated as such in this context), then the changes on the right side should be considered.

- The assertion after the conflict (`assertThat(map.getTags()).isEqualTo(Arrays.asList("jbake", "java", "tag-with-space").toArray());`) is the same on both sides, indicating that the expected outcome of the test hasn't changed.

Given these considerations, a resolved version of the snippet, if we decide to take the changes from the right side (since they seem to reflect a potential improvement or refactoring), would be:

```java
        assertThat(map.getTags()).isEqualTo(Arrays.asList("jbake", "java", "tag with space").toArray());
    }

    @Test
    public void sanitizeTags() {
        config.setProperty(TAG_SANITIZE.getKey(), true);
        Map<String, Object> map = parser.processFile(validaAsciidocWithUnsanitizedHeader);

        assertThat(map.getTags()).isEqualTo(Arrays.asList("jbake", "java", "tag-with-space").toArray());
    }



```

However, the task requires returning the entire snippet in markdown code syntax without modifying the context, and preserving the spacing as is. Thus, the correct response should directly address the conflict:

```java
        assertThat(map.getTags()).isEqualTo(Arrays.asList("jbake", "java", "tag with space").toArray());
    }

    @Test
    public void sanitizeTags() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        config.setProperty(JBakeProperty.TAG_SANITIZE, true);
        DocumentModel map = parser.processFile(validaAsciidocWithUnsanitizedHeader);
=======
        config.setProperty(TAG_SANITIZE.getKey(), true);
        Map<String, Object> map = parser.processFile(validaAsciidocWithUnsanitizedHeader);
>>>>>>> d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb

        assertThat(map.getTags()).isEqualTo(Arrays.asList("jbake", "java", "tag-with-space").toArray());
    }
