To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a test class, given the presence of `@Test` and the usage of mocking (`when`, `verify`) and test-related assertions (`assertStatusIs`). 

The conflict arises between two different versions of a test method: `shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun`. 

- The version from `HEAD` (the local branch being merged) has a method with a `void` return type and is declared to throw `CoreException`. It also contains a call to `prepateCore(projectAUri(), 0)`, which seems to be a typo and should likely be `prepareCore`.
- The version from `ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586` (the branch being merged into the local branch) has a method with a `public void` return type, also throwing `CoreException`, and correctly calls `prepareCore(projectAUri(), 0)`.

The main differences are:
1. Access modifier (`public` is explicit in the incoming change but implicit in the current `HEAD` version, as methods are `public` by default in Java when no modifier is specified).
2. Spelling correction in `prepareCore`.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we must consider the intent behind both changes. Both versions aim to test the behavior of `InfinitestCore` when no tests are run. The correction of `prepateCore` to `prepareCore` is a clear bug fix, improving the code's correctness. The addition of the `public` access modifier is not necessary but is not harmful either, as it makes the method's access explicit.

Given this analysis, the most sensible resolution is to take the version from `ee249315695b6123b42f6cb1b6ab1489e37eb586`, as it includes the correction of the typo (`prepateCore` to `prepareCore`), and there's no significant semantic difference introduced by making the method `public` explicitly.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
		when(coreRegistry.getCore(projectAUri)).thenReturn(core);
		return core;
	}

	@Test
	public void shouldSetAppropriateStatusIfNoTestsWereRun() throws CoreException {
		InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 0);

		workspace.updateProjects(Collections.singleton(resource));

		assertStatusIs(noTestsRun());
		verify(core).setRuntimeEnvironment(any(RuntimeEnvironment.class));

```
