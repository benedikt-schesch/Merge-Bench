To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of an Android application, given the import statements referencing Android classes and components.

The conflict arises from the import statements where the `HEAD` version (the local version) and the version from `c08e0d7adee3a6c42dfe2887fad422ea332c015e` (the version being merged) have differing import statements.

### Analyzing the Conflict

- The `HEAD` version includes imports for `android.content.SharedPreferences` and `android.content.res.Resources`.
- The version being merged (`c08e0d7adee3a6c42dfe2887fad422ea332c015e`) includes imports for `android.content.Intent`, `android.content.SharedPreferences`, `android.net.Uri`, and `android.provider.Browser`.

### Resolving the Conflict

To resolve this conflict, we should consider what imports are necessary for the functionality intended by both versions. 

1. **SharedPreferences** is imported in both versions, indicating that both sides likely use shared preferences, so this import should be retained.
   
2. The `HEAD` version imports `Resources`, which could be used for accessing resources like strings, layouts, etc. If the `HEAD` version uses resources directly, this import is necessary.

3. The version being merged imports `Intent`, `Uri`, and `Browser`. These are typically used for actions like opening URLs or sending intents between components. `Intent` and `Uri` are commonly used in Android development for a variety of purposes, including opening web pages or other activities. `Browser` is a bit more specific and is used for interacting with the browser application.

Given the information and focusing on the semantic intent:

- Both sides are importing `SharedPreferences`, so it's clear that `SharedPreferences` is used and should be kept.
- The `HEAD` version is using `Resources`, which might be necessary depending on how resources are accessed within the class.
- The other side is importing classes that suggest functionality related to intents and possibly opening URLs or other activities.

Since there's no clear indication that either set of imports is redundant or that they conflict in a way that can't be resolved by simply including all necessary imports, the most straightforward resolution is to include all the imports from both sides.

### Resolved Snippet

```java
import org.apache.http.protocol.HttpContext;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.app.ListActivity;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.SharedPreferences;
import android.content.res.Resources;
import android.net.Uri;
import android.provider.Browser;
import android.view.LayoutInflater;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.ListView;
import android.widget.TextView;
import android.widget.Toast;
```

This resolution includes all the import statements from both the `HEAD` version and the version being merged, thus preserving the functionality intended by both. 

Therefore, the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context, is:
```java
import org.apache.http.protocol.HttpContext;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.app.ListActivity;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.SharedPreferences;
import android.content.res.Resources;
import android.net.Uri;
import android.provider.Browser;
import android.view.LayoutInflater;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.ListView;
import android.widget.TextView;
import android.widget.Toast;
