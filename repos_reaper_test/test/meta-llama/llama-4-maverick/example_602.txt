To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The conflict is within the `convertLabels` method, specifically in the condition that checks `rawLabels`. 

On the left-hand side (HEAD), the condition checks if `rawLabels` is not null and if it's an object (`rawLabels.isObject()`). 

On the right-hand side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe), the condition checks if `rawLabels` is not null and if it contains a key named "data" (`rawLabels.get("data") != null`).

Both conditions seem to be checking the validity or the presence of certain data within `rawLabels` before attempting to parse or convert it. However, they are checking different aspects.

The left-hand side checks if `rawLabels` is an object, which is a more general check that ensures `rawLabels` is of the expected type or structure before trying to access its elements.

The right-hand side directly checks for the presence of "data" within `rawLabels`, which implies that `rawLabels` is expected to be some form of map or dictionary. It then proceeds to access `rawLabels.get("data")` and convert its string representation to a Java list.

Upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the right-hand side is actually doing a more specific check that is relevant to the subsequent lines of code, which access `rawLabels.get("data")`. 

However, the left-hand side condition (`rawLabels.isObject()`) is not necessarily redundant or conflicting with the intent of checking if `rawLabels` has a "data" key. 

If we resolve the conflict by simply taking the right-hand side, we risk losing the null check for `rawLabels` being not null is still present, but the check for `rawLabels` being an object is lost. 

A more semantically correct resolution might involve combining the intent of both checks: ensuring `rawLabels` is not null and is an object before checking for the "data" key. 

Here's how the resolved code snippet could look, returned in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
    return labels.remove(label);
  }

  @JsonMappingCompleted
  protected void convertLabels(JsonMapper jsonMapper) {
    if (rawLabels != null && rawLabels.isObject() && rawLabels.get("data") != null) {
      String innerLabelsString = rawLabels.get("data").toString();
      labels = jsonMapper.toJavaList(innerLabelsString, PageLabel.class);
    }
  }
```
