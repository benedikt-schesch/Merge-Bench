To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of a test setup for a project-related class, likely within an IntelliJ IDEA plugin given the presence of classes like `ProjectFileIndex`, `ProjectRootManager`, and `ModuleManager`. The snippet is setting up mocks for various dependencies and configuring some of their behaviors.

The merge conflict arises from the difference in the mocks being created between the two branches being merged. 

- The local branch (`HEAD`) has added mocks for `ModuleRootManager` and `Sdk`.
- The other branch (`3c868cbe67875b5515d13bd8b8237e13dd2f9c32`) has added mocks for `ModuleSettings` and `RuntimeEnvironment`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes in both branches. 

1. The `HEAD` branch seems to be working on or related to module root management or SDK-related functionality, as indicated by the introduction of `ModuleRootManager` and `Sdk` mocks.
2. The other branch appears to be focused on module settings and runtime environment, introducing mocks for `ModuleSettings` and `RuntimeEnvironment`.

Without more context about how these mocks are used later in the test or the specific requirements of the changes being merged, the most straightforward resolution is to include all the mocks. This approach assumes that both sets of changes are valid and necessary for their respective functionalities or tests.

Thus, the resolution involves including both `moduleRootManager`, `sdk` from the `HEAD` branch, and `moduleSettings`, `runtimeEnvironment` from the other branch.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
		messageBus = mock(MessageBus.class);
		messageBusConnection = mock(MessageBusConnection.class);
		projectFileIndex = mock(ProjectFileIndex.class);
		projectRootManager = mock(ProjectRootManager.class);
		launcher = mock(InfinitestLauncher.class);
		moduleRootManager = mock(ModuleRootManager.class);
		sdk = mock(Sdk.class);
		moduleSettings = mock(ModuleSettings.class);
		runtimeEnvironment = mock(RuntimeEnvironment.class);
		control = new ProjectTestControl(project);
		annotator = mock(InfinitestAnnotator.class);
		
		when(project.getComponent(ModuleManager.class)).thenReturn(moduleManager);
		when(project.getMessageBus()).thenReturn(messageBus);
```
