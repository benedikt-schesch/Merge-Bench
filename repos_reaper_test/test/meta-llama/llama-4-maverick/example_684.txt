To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be handling a situation where certain principals (users or groups) are missing during a data deployment process. The `missingPrincipals` list is being used to store the names of these missing principals.

Both versions of the conflicted code are constructing a warning message to be logged and possibly displayed to the user. The message includes a title, a descriptive text, and a list of the missing principals.

The differences between the two versions are:

1. The wording of the descriptive text: The `HEAD` version uses "resource access permissions or node ownership" and "missing permissions/ownerships," while the other version uses "grants or node ownership" and "missing grants/ownerships." Both versions convey a similar meaning, but the terminology differs.
2. The punctuation at the end of the first sentence of the descriptive text: The `HEAD` version uses a period (`.`), while the other version uses an exclamation mark (`!`).
3. The method used to join the `missingPrincipals` list into a string: The `HEAD` version uses `String.join()`, while the other version uses a stream to sort the list before joining it with `Collectors.joining()`.

To resolve the conflict, we should consider the intent behind both versions. It seems that both versions are trying to improve the clarity and informativeness of the warning message. 

The other version (`83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965`) appears to have made more significant changes, including sorting the list of missing principals, which could be considered an improvement for user experience as it makes the list more readable.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
		applyConfigurationFileIfExists(context, source.resolve("post-data-deploy.conf"), DEPLOYMENT_DATA_IMPORT_STATUS);

		if (!missingPrincipals.isEmpty()) {

			final String title = "Missing Principal(s)";
			final String text = "The following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for grants or node ownership during <b>data deployment</b>.<br>"
					+ "Because of these missing grants/ownerships, <b>node access rights are not identical to the export you just imported</b>!"
					+ "<ul><li>" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("</li><li>")) + "</li></ul>"
					+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf\">pre-data-deploy.conf</a> and re-importing.";

			logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
					+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
```
