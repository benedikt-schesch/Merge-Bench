To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of a Jenkins plugin or a similar application, given the imports. The merge conflict is related to import statements.

The conflicting lines are:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.DoNotUse;
=======
>>>>>>> 7cf5285aa22796bde5c291b9604234d5eeaac6d2
```
Here, the `HEAD` side (typically the local branch being merged into) includes an import statement for `org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.DoNotUse`, while the other side (the branch being merged, with commit hash starting with `7cf5285`) does not include any import statement in this position, effectively removing or not including the `DoNotUse` import.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. 

1. The `HEAD` side is using `org.kohsuke.accmod.restrictions.DoNotUse`, indicating that somewhere in the code, there's a usage or reference to this annotation or class. The presence of this import suggests that it's being utilized to mark certain elements as not to be used, possibly for deprecated or restricted API.

2. The other side (`7cf5285aa22796bde5c291b9604234d5eeaac6d2`) is not including this import. This could mean one of two things: either the code on this side does not use `DoNotUse`, or it has been removed or relocated.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we would need to examine the surrounding code (not just the imports) to see if `DoNotUse` is actually being used and if its usage is necessary or if it has been removed or replaced.

However, without additional context or information about the changes made in both branches, the safest course of action is to preserve the conflict as is because we cannot be certain of the intent.

Thus, the resolution, given the information and preserving the original spacing and context, is to return the snippet as provided, since we cannot confidently determine the semantic intent behind the conflicting changes.
