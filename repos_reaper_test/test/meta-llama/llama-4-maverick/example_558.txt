To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be setting properties for various Facebook-related types using the `props.setProperty` method. The properties being set are in the format of `${Type}.methods`, where `Type` is a specific Facebook-related type (e.g., `CategorizedFacebookType`, `Category`, `Checkin`, etc.), and the value is obtained by joining methods fetched from the corresponding class.

The conflict arises between the lines marked by `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`. The code on the `HEAD` side (the local changes) continues with setting properties for `Conversation.methods`, `Conversation.Tag.methods`, `DeAuth.methods`, etc., without any interruption. The incoming changes from the other branch (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) introduce two additional property settings: `Comment.Attachment.methods` and `Comment.Comments.methods`.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to consider the intent behind both sets of changes. The `HEAD` side continues a sequence of setting properties for various types without any apparent gaps or omissions related to the `Comment` type. The incoming changes add specific properties related to `Comment`, namely `Comment.Attachment.methods` and `Comment.Comments.methods`, suggesting that these are new or previously unhandled aspects of the `Comment` type.

Given this context, it seems reasonable to assume that both sides are trying to achieve a comprehensive coverage of Facebook-related types by setting their respective methods as properties. The `HEAD` side continues this process for various types, while the incoming changes enhance the coverage for the `Comment` type by including its nested or related types (`Attachment` and `Comments`).

Therefore, the resolution should involve incorporating both sets of changes. The resulting code should include the additional properties introduced by the incoming changes (`Comment.Attachment.methods` and `Comment.Comments.methods`) alongside the properties set by the `HEAD` side.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
    props.setProperty("CategorizedFacebookType.methods",
      joinMethods(fetchMethodsFromClass(CategorizedFacebookType.class)));
    props.setProperty("Category.methods", joinMethods(fetchMethodsFromClass(Category.class)));
    props.setProperty("Checkin.methods", joinMethods(fetchMethodsFromClass(Checkin.class)));
    props.setProperty("Comment.methods", joinMethods(fetchMethodsFromClass(Comment.class)));
    props.setProperty("Comment.Attachment.methods", joinMethods(fetchMethodsFromClass(StoryAttachment.class)));
    props.setProperty("Comment.Comments.methods", joinMethods(fetchMethodsFromClass(Comment.Comments.class)));
    props.setProperty("Conversation.methods", joinMethods(fetchMethodsFromClass(Conversation.class)));
    props.setProperty("Conversation.Tag.methods", joinMethods(fetchMethodsFromClass(Conversation.Tag.class)));
    props.setProperty("DeAuth.methods", joinMethods(fetchMethodsFromClass(DeAuth.class)));
    props.setProperty("Event.methods", joinMethods(fetchMethodsFromClass(Event.class)));
    props.setProperty("Event.Category.methods", joinMethods(fetchMethodsFromClass(Event.Category.class)));
