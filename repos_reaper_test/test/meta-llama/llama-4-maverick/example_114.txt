To resolve this merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made in both branches.

The given Java code snippet is part of a class definition for `FileAssert`, which extends `AbstractAssert`. The class is annotated with author information, indicating the contributors to this class. The conflict arises in the list of authors.

On one side of the merge (represented by `HEAD`), the author listed is `Olivier Michallat`. On the other side (represented by the commit `4057ed7267373746aac7309260708831177d38dc`), the author is `Olivier Demeijer`.

To resolve this, we need to consider the intent behind both changes. Both sides are adding an author named "Olivier" but with different last names. 

Upon closer inspection, it appears that both `Olivier Michallat` and `Olivier Demeijer` could be legitimate authors, as there's no additional context that suggests one is incorrect or a typo. 

However, without further information about the correct author's name, we should consider the possibility that both names refer to the same individual, potentially due to a misspelling or a variation in the name (e.g., a married name or a name change).

Given the information available, a reasonable semantic resolution would be to include both names if they are indeed different individuals or to correct one to match the other if they refer to the same person. However, the code does not provide enough context to make a definitive decision between these options.

Therefore, a conservative approach is to preserve the information from both sides of the merge by including both authors, as removing one in favor of the other could result in losing a valid contribution acknowledgment.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
 * </p>
 * 
 * @author David DIDIER
 * @author Yvonne Wang
 * @author Alex Ruiz
 * @author Olivier Michallat
 * @author Olivier Demeijer
 */
public class FileAssert extends AbstractAssert<FileAssert, File> {

  @VisibleForTesting
  Files files = Files.instance();
```

However, to strictly follow the instructions and ensure we're not altering the context or making assumptions beyond what's provided, if we were unsure or if the intent was ambiguous, the original conflict should be preserved. In this case, I've made an educated resolution.

The final answer is:
```java
 * </p>
 * 
 * @author David DIDIER
 * @author Yvonne Wang
 * @author Alex Ruiz
 * @author Olivier Michallat
 * @author Olivier Demeijer
 */
public class FileAssert extends AbstractAssert<FileAssert, File> {

  @VisibleForTesting
  Files files = Files.instance();
```
