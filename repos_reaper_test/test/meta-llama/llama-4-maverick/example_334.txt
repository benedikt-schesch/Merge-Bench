To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of an Android application, given the use of `AsyncTask`. The conflict arises in the declaration of a private inner class named `GetPhotoTask`.

On one side of the merge (HEAD), `GetPhotoTask` extends `GenericTask`. On the other side (3cac0b691a1f6bce876565b41eb831a0f4e82d6d), it extends `AsyncTask<String, Void, TaskResult>`, with an additional FIXME comment indicating a known issue related to image display after a database change.

Let's analyze the intent behind both changes:

1. **Extending `GenericTask`**: This suggests that `GetPhotoTask` is intended to be a task that leverages the functionality or structure provided by `GenericTask`. The specifics of `GenericTask` are not shown, but it might offer some common task handling or utility methods.

2. **Extending `AsyncTask<String, Void, TaskResult>`**: This change indicates that `GetPhotoTask` is meant to perform an asynchronous operation that takes a `String` parameter, does not publish progress updates (hence `Void`), and returns a `TaskResult`. This is a more traditional Android way of handling background tasks.

The `_doInBackground` method is implemented with `TaskParams...params`, which seems to be compatible with the structure expected by `GenericTask` (assuming it's based on or similar to `AsyncTask` in terms of method signature). However, the change to `AsyncTask` directly might imply a simplification or a change in the task handling framework.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent and the functionality required by `GetPhotoTask`. 

- If `GenericTask` is a custom class that provides some necessary functionality or compatibility that `AsyncTask` does not, then extending `GenericTask` might be the correct choice. However, the FIXME comment on the other side suggests there might be an issue with `GenericTask` or its usage in the context of the new database.

- If the application is moving away from `GenericTask` towards a more standard `AsyncTask` implementation (or if `GenericTask` is not necessary for `GetPhotoTask`), then extending `AsyncTask` could be the way to go.

Given the information and the fact that the `_doInBackground` method seems to be designed with a varargs `TaskParams` parameter, which aligns more with the structure of `GenericTask` or a custom task framework rather than the direct `AsyncTask` implementation, we should be cautious.

However, without knowing the specifics of `GenericTask` and `TaskParams`, and considering the FIXME comment indicating a potential issue with the current implementation, a safe resolution isn't straightforward.

Since the intent is somewhat ambiguous and without further context on `GenericTask` and the implications of the FIXME comment, the best course of action would be to return the snippet as is, with the conflict markers.

```java
	        mPhotoTask.execute(params);
        }
    }
