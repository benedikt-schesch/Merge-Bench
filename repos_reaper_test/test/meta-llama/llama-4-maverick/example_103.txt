To resolve the merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet.

The conflict arises in two areas: 

1. The `isEqualTo` method has a difference in spacing between the `HEAD` and `61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7` versions. The `HEAD` version has `isEqualTo(short expected){` while the other version has `isEqualTo(short expected) {`. The difference is the presence of a space before the opening bracket.

2. There's also a conflict marker at the end of the snippet, but it seems incomplete as there's no code after `<<<<<<< HEAD`. However, based on the provided information, we can still analyze the intent.

The intent behind both versions of the `isEqualTo` method appears to be the same: to assert that the actual short value is equal to the expected short value. The difference in spacing does not affect the semantics of the code.

Given that the semantic intent is the same, we can resolve the conflict by choosing one version of the `isEqualTo` method. The standard Java coding conventions typically include a space before the opening bracket of a method declaration. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by adopting the version with the space.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java

  protected ShortAssert(Short actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ShortAssert.class, description);
  }

  public ShortAssert isEqualTo(short expected) {
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```

Since the conflict is resolved by adopting the version with the space before the opening bracket, and there's no code after the conflict marker, the snippet is returned without the conflict markers.

```java

  protected ShortAssert(Short actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ShortAssert.class, description);
  }

  public ShortAssert isEqualTo(short expected) {
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```
