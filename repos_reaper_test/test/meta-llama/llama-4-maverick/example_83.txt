To resolve this merge conflict, we first need to understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge. The conflict is in the line where an `ArrayList` is initialized with a size based on the `textParts` parameter, which is a `JSONArray`.

The two conflicting lines are:
- `final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.size());`
- `final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());`

The difference between them is the method used to determine the initial size of the `ArrayList`: `size()` versus `length()`.

`JSONArray` is a class that can behave differently depending on its actual implementation. However, typically, `JSONArray` from libraries like `org.json` has a `length()` method to get the number of elements it contains, not `size()`. On the other hand, some implementations or similar classes might use `size()`.

Given the context, `textParts` is a `JSONArray`, and typically, `JSONArray` has a `length()` property. Therefore, the line `final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());` seems to be more appropriate if we are dealing with a standard `JSONArray` implementation like the one in `org.json`.

However, the intent here is to initialize an `ArrayList` with a capacity that matches the number of elements in `textParts`. Both `size()` and `length()` are attempting to achieve this, but they reflect different assumptions about the type or implementation of `textParts`.

Since the rest of the code snippet does not show any compilation issues with using `textParts` as a `JSONArray` and iterating over it, and given that `JSONArray` typically has a `length()` property, the version using `length()` seems more semantically correct for a `JSONArray`.

However, without knowing the exact implementation or library used for `JSONArray`, we can't be 100% sure. 

The code snippet provided in markdown code syntax as requested, with the conflict resolved based on the assumption that `textParts` is a standard `JSONArray` (thus using `length()`), is as follows:

```java
  private CustomCardFormatHelper() {
  }

  public static String formatBlackCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // TODO this is going to need some work to look pretty.
    final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());
    for (final Object o : textParts) {
      strs.add((String) o);
    }
    final String text = StringUtils.join(strs, "____");
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml11(text);
```

If we were to return the original snippet with the conflict, it would look like this:

```java
  private CustomCardFormatHelper() {
  }

  public static String formatBlackCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // TODO this is going to need some work to look pretty.
