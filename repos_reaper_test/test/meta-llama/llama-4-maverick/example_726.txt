To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand what a merge conflict is. A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from two different branches into a single branch. This usually happens when the same lines of code have been modified differently in the two branches.

Given the code snippet:
```java

import java.util.ArrayList;


public class CardStack extends RelativeLayout {
<<<<<<< HEAD

    public static final int DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN = 20;

    private int mStackMargin = DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN;
=======
    private boolean mEnableRotation;
    private int mGravity;
>>>>>>> 4f63cd1aed839ff53f4afb6076a74f113d583e40
    private int mColor = -1;
    private int mIndex = 0;
    private int mNumVisible = 4;
    private boolean canSwipe = true;
    private ArrayAdapter<?> mAdapter;

```
Let's analyze the conflict:

- The `HEAD` version (the version in the current branch) introduces a constant `DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN` and a variable `mStackMargin` initialized with this constant.
- The other version (from the branch being merged, `4f63cd1aed839ff53f4afb6076a74f113d583e40`) introduces two new variables: `mEnableRotation` and `mGravity`.

The rest of the code (after the conflict) seems to be common or not affected by the conflict directly.

To resolve this, we should consider the intent and semantics of both changes. The `HEAD` version is adding a margin-related feature, while the other version is adding rotation and gravity-related features to the `CardStack` class.

Since there's no direct overlap or conflict in the intent (one is about margin and the other about rotation and gravity), and the conflicting lines are not directly related to the code that follows (which seems to be a continuation of the class variables declarations), we can simply merge them by removing the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and keeping both sets of changes.

Here's how the resolved code should look:

```java

import java.util.ArrayList;


public class CardStack extends RelativeLayout {

    public static final int DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN = 20;

    private int mStackMargin = DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN;
    private boolean mEnableRotation;
    private int mGravity;
    private int mColor = -1;
    private int mIndex = 0;
    private int mNumVisible = 4;
    private boolean canSwipe = true;
    private ArrayAdapter<?> mAdapter;

```

The answer is:
```java

import java.util.ArrayList;


public class CardStack extends RelativeLayout {

    public static final int DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN = 20;

    private int mStackMargin = DEFAULT_STACK_MARGIN;
    private boolean mEnableRotation;
    private int mGravity;
    private int mColor = -1;
    private int mIndex = 0;
    private int mNumVisible = 4;
    private boolean canSwipe = true;
    private ArrayAdapter<?> mAdapter;

```
