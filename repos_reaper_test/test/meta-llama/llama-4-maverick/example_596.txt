To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that interacts with the Facebook API using the RestFB library. The import statements are used to bring in various classes and static methods from other packages.

The conflict arises from the import statements related to `com.restfb.json`. On one side (HEAD), we have imports for `Json` and `JsonValue`, while on the other side (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`), the imports are for `JsonArray` and `JsonObject`.

Let's analyze the intent behind both sets of imports. The `Json` and `JsonValue` classes are part of a JSON handling library, where `JsonValue` is a base class for different types of JSON values, and `Json` might be a utility class for handling JSON. On the other hand, `JsonArray` and `JsonObject` are specific types of JSON values, representing arrays and objects, respectively.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider whether the code is intended to work with the more general `JsonValue` or directly with `JsonArray` and `JsonObject`. 

Since both `JsonArray` and `JsonObject` are subclasses of `JsonValue`, and there's no information provided about the usage of these imports within the given context, we'll have to decide based on the likelihood of their usage.

In many JSON handling libraries, using specific types like `JsonArray` and `JsonObject` when needed is common, but having a more general type like `JsonValue` can be useful for handling different types of JSON values polymorphically.

Given that there's no additional context on how these imports are used, a safe resolution would be to include all necessary imports if we assume that both sides of the merge are valid and needed.

Here's how we can resolve it:

```java
import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromLongFormat;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;

import com.restfb.Facebook;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper.JsonMappingCompleted;
import com.restfb.json.Json;
import com.restfb.json.JsonArray;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
import com.restfb.json.JsonValue;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.List;
```

Let's return this resolution in the required markdown code syntax:

```java
import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromLongFormat;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;

import com.restfb.Facebook;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper.JsonMappingCompleted;
import com.restfb.json.Json;
import com.restfb.json.JsonArray;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
import com.restfb.json.JsonValue;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.List;
```
