To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The given Java code snippet appears to be part of a class constructor or a method that is initializing certain class fields based on some conditions. The fields being initialized include `totalCount`, `data`, `facebookClient`, and `connectionType`.

The conflict arises in the line where `this.data` is being assigned a value. The two versions of the code are:
- `this.data = unmodifiableList(dataItem);` from the `HEAD` (typically the local or current branch).
- `this.data = unmodifiableList(dataList);` from the commit `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` (typically the branch being merged into the current branch).

Let's analyze the intent behind both versions:
1. Both versions are using `unmodifiableList()` to wrap the list, indicating an intent to ensure that `this.data` is not modified after it's set. This suggests that the immutability of `this.data` is a desired property.
2. The difference lies in what is being wrapped by `unmodifiableList()`: `dataItem` in the `HEAD` version versus `dataList` in the other version.

To understand which version is semantically correct or how to merge them, we need to know what `dataItem` and `dataList` represent. Without additional context about these variables (e.g., their types, how they're initialized, and their roles in the surrounding code), it's challenging to make an informed decision.

However, we can make some educated guesses based on their names:
- `dataItem` might suggest a single item or a collection treated as an item.
- `dataList` explicitly suggests a list of items.

If `dataItem` is indeed a collection (like a List), and `dataList` is also a list, they could potentially be related, but their names suggest different things. Without knowing their declarations or how they're used elsewhere, it's difficult to say which one is "correct."

Given the lack of context about `dataItem` and `dataList`, and sticking strictly to the guidelines provided:

```java
      totalCount = jsonSummary.get("total_count") != null ? jsonSummary.getLong("total_count", 0L) : null;
    } else {
      totalCount = null;
    }
