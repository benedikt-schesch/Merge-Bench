To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made in both branches.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class used for assertions, specifically for `long` values (`LongAssert`). The class has methods to assert whether a `long` value is equal to or not equal to an expected value.

The conflict arises in the `isNotEqualTo` method. Here's the conflicting snippet again:

```java
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected){
=======
  public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected) {
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    longs.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
```

Let's analyze the changes:

1. The code before the conflict (`longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);`) is not part of the conflict itself but provides context. It shows a method `isEqualTo` that asserts the equality of `actual` and `expected` values.

2. The conflict is in the `isNotEqualTo` method. The difference between the two versions is the presence or absence of a space after the method declaration (`public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected)`).

   - The `HEAD` version (local changes) has the method declared as `public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected){` without a space before the opening bracket.
   - The `61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7` version (incoming changes) has it as `public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected) {` with a space before the opening bracket.

The intent of both versions is semantically the same; they are asserting that the `actual` value is not equal to the `expected` value. The difference is purely in the formatting (presence or absence of a space before the opening bracket of the method).

Since the difference is only in formatting and not in the functionality or logic of the code, we can resolve this by choosing one formatting style over the other. Typically, Java coding conventions suggest having a space before the opening bracket for method declarations.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing as much as possible, and resolving the conflict by choosing the version with a space before the opening bracket for consistency with typical Java coding conventions:

```java
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

  public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected) {
    longs.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
