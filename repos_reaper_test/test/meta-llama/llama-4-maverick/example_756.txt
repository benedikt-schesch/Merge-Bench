To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of a class (likely an Activity given the use of `getSupportActionBar()`) that is handling the binding to an OpenPGP service. The conflict arises when changes from two different branches (or commits) are merged, and Git is unable to automatically reconcile the differences.

Let's analyze the given snippet:

```java
            // bind to service
            mServiceConnection = new OpenPgpServiceConnection(
                    PgpHandler.this, providerPackageName, this);
            mServiceConnection.bindToService();
<<<<<<< HEAD

            bindingDialog = new ProgressDialog(this);
            bindingDialog.setMessage(this.getResources().getString(R.string.okc_progress_text));
            bindingDialog.setCancelable(false);
            bindingDialog.show();

>>>>>>> cff7c7e6063492e6b52eb7e74b4ea628e8e7ecbc
            registered = true;
            getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);
        }
    }
```

The conflict is between the code that exists on the `HEAD` branch (local changes) and the code on the branch being merged (`cff7c7e6063492e6b52eb7e74b4ea628e8e7ecbc`).

On the `HEAD` side, a `ProgressDialog` is created and shown. This dialog is used to display a progress message (`R.string.okc_progress_text`) to the user while presumably waiting for the service binding to complete. The dialog is not cancelable, indicating that the binding process is necessary and should not be interrupted by the user.

On the other side of the merge (`cff7c7e6063492e6b52eb7e74b4ea628e8e7ecbc`), there are no additional lines of code within the conflicting section. The changes from this side are essentially about not having the `ProgressDialog` code.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to understand the intent behind both changes:

1. The `HEAD` side is showing a progress dialog to the user, indicating that some operation (likely the binding to the OpenPGP service) is in progress. This suggests that the binding process might take noticeable time, and the app is informing the user about it.

2. The other side (`cff7c7e6063492e6b52eb7e74b4ea628e8e7ecbc`) does not include the progress dialog code, suggesting either that the binding is expected to be quick, or the feedback to the user is handled differently (either not at all or through a different mechanism).

Given these observations, a semantic resolution involves deciding whether the progress dialog is necessary. If the binding process is indeed asynchronous and potentially time-consuming, showing a progress dialog is a good practice to prevent the app from appearing unresponsive.

However, without additional context on how `mServiceConnection.bindToService();` behaves (whether it's asynchronous and how it notifies the caller of its completion), it's challenging to make a definitive decision.

Since both versions of the code are valid depending on the intent (either showing a progress dialog or not), and assuming that the progress dialog serves a purpose (like providing feedback to the user during a potentially slow operation), the most straightforward resolution that preserves functionality and user feedback would be to include the progress dialog code.

Thus, the resolved code snippet, preserving the original context and spacing, would be:

```java
            // bind to service
            mServiceConnection = new OpenPgpServiceConnection(
                    PgpHandler.this, providerPackageName, this);
            mServiceConnection.bindToService();

            bindingDialog = new ProgressDialog(this);
            bindingDialog.setMessage(this.getResources().getString(R.string.okc_progress_text));
            bindingDialog.setCancelable(false);
            bindingDialog.show();

            registered = true;
            getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);
        }
    }
```

However, to adhere strictly to the instructions and return the snippet in markdown code syntax as provided, the corrected version should be presented as:
```java
// bind to service
mServiceConnection = new OpenPgpServiceConnection(
        PgpHandler.this, providerPackageName, this);
mServiceConnection.bindToService();

bindingDialog = new ProgressDialog(this);
bindingDialog.setMessage(this.getResources().getString(R.string.okc_progress_text));
bindingDialog.setCancelable(false);
bindingDialog.show();

registered = true;
getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);
}
}
```
is not the correct representation. The correct representation should include the original context.

The final answer is:
```java

            // bind to service
            mServiceConnection = new OpenPgpServiceConnection(
                    PgpHandler.this, providerPackageName, this);
            mServiceConnection.bindToService();

            bindingDialog = new ProgressDialog(this);
            bindingDialog.setMessage(this.getResources().getString(R.string.okc_progress_text));
            bindingDialog.setCancelable(false);
            bindingDialog.show();
            registered = true;
            getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);
        }
    }

```
