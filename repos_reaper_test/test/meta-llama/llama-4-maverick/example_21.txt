To resolve this merge conflict, I will analyze the given code snippet and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

```java
			}
		}
		getEventManager().registerEvents(listener, this);
		getEventManager().callEvent(new EngineStartEvent());
		filesystem.postStartup();
<<<<<<< HEAD
		WorldSavingThread.startThread();
=======
		filesystem.notifyInstalls();
>>>>>>> 67bcb76a96f358fc131320b0611ffaa3bf3678c2
		Spout.info("Done Loading, ready for players.");
	}

	@Override
	protected void setupBindings(SpoutConfiguration config) {

```

The conflict arises between `WorldSavingThread.startThread();` and `filesystem.notifyInstalls();`. To understand the intent behind these changes, let's examine what each line does.

- `WorldSavingThread.startThread();` suggests that it starts a thread responsible for saving the world. This is likely crucial for the game's or server's functionality, ensuring that the world state is periodically saved to prevent data loss.

- `filesystem.notifyInstalls();` implies that it notifies the filesystem (or related components) about certain installs or potentially triggers some action related to the installation or management of plugins, mods, or other content.

Both changes seem to be related to post-startup initialization or housekeeping tasks. Starting a world-saving thread is essential for maintaining the integrity of the game world, while notifying installs could be related to initializing or updating plugins/mods.

Since both changes appear to serve distinct purposes and do not directly conflict with each other semantically (one is about world saving and the other about notifying installs), a reasonable resolution would be to include both lines in the final code, ensuring that both functionalities are preserved.

The resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, without modifying the context and preserving the original spacing, would be:

```java
			}
		}
		getEventManager().registerEvents(listener, this);
		getEventManager().callEvent(new EngineStartEvent());
		filesystem.postStartup();
		WorldSavingThread.startThread();
		filesystem.notifyInstalls();
		Spout.info("Done Loading, ready for players.");
	}

	@Override
	protected void setupBindings(SpoutConfiguration config) {

```
