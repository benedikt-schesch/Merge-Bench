To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the code snippet and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The original code snippet before the merge conflict is not fully available, but we can infer the context and changes from the given snippet. We have a method `handle` that is part of a class implementing some interface or extending another class. This method returns a `Map` of `ReturnableData` to `Object` and is dealing with handling a request and possibly managing chat functionality based on certain conditions.

The conflict arises between two commits or branches: `HEAD` and `ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967`. The changes are in the `handle` method.

1. **Changes from `HEAD`**: The code from `HEAD` simply initializes a `HashMap` named `ret` and puts `AjaxResponse.GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED` with the value of `globalChatEnabled` into it.

2. **Changes from `ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967`**: This version not only initializes a `HashMap` (with explicit type parameters, unlike `HEAD` which uses the diamond operator) but also puts `AjaxResponse.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED` with the value of `gameChatEnabled` into the map before putting `AjaxResponse.GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED` with `globalChatEnabled`.

The intent behind both changes seems to be related to enabling or disabling certain chat functionalities (`GAME_CHAT_ENABLED` and `GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED`) and returning this information as part of the response.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider if both changes are necessary and if they serve the same purpose or complement each other.

1. The difference in `HashMap` initialization (`new HashMap<>();` vs `new HashMap<ReturnableData, Object>();`) is purely stylistic regarding the use of the diamond operator. Both are functionally equivalent in Java 7 and later.

2. The main conflict is about the inclusion of `ret.put(AjaxResponse.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED, gameChatEnabled);`. The version from `ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967` includes this line, which is not present in the `HEAD` version.

Since `HEAD` does not remove `GAME_CHAT_ENABLED` but simply does not include it, and assuming that `gameChatEnabled` and `globalChatEnabled` are related but distinct functionalities, the most logical resolution is to include both `GAME_CHAT_ENABLED` and `GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED` in the response.

Therefore, the resolved code should include both changes: initializing the `HashMap` and putting both `GAME_CHAT_ENABLED` and `GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED` into it. The difference in the `HashMap` initialization can be resolved by keeping the more explicit version or the version that adheres to the project's coding standards.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
    this.userPermalinkFormatString = userPermalinkFormatString;
  }

  @Override
  public Map<ReturnableData, Object> handle(final RequestWrapper request,
      final HttpSession session) {
    final HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> ret = new HashMap<>();
    ret.put(AjaxResponse.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED, gameChatEnabled);
    ret.put(AjaxResponse.GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED, globalChatEnabled);

    if (banList.contains(request.getRemoteAddr())) {
      LOG.info(String.format("Rejecting user from %s because they are banned.",
              request.getRemoteAddr()));
```
