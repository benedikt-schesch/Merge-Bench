To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a configuration class, possibly in a dependency injection framework like Guice, given the presence of `@Override`, `bind()`, and `@Provides` annotations.

The conflict arises in two places: within the `configure()` method and at the beginning of the `@Provides` method for `provideRawClasspathConfigurers`.

1. **Conflict in `configure()` method:**
   - The `HEAD` side binds `IMaven.class` to an instance of `MavenPlugin.getMaven()` and binds `BuildPathManager.class`.
   - The other side (from commit `4b0f0ad0ce6afc98a1fc78b9fe46584c41f478e8`) binds `RemoveNonRuntimeProjectsConfigurer.class`.

To resolve this, we need to understand the intent:
- The `HEAD` side is configuring bindings related to Maven and a `BuildPathManager`.
- The other side is adding a configurer related to removing non-runtime projects.

Both changes seem to be adding different configurers or bindings that are not directly conflicting in terms of their functionality. Thus, the resolution could involve including all the bindings.

2. **Conflict in `@Provides` method:**
   - The conflict here is merely due to the proximity of the `@Provides` method to the conflict in the `configure()` method. The actual conflict is just a newline character, which does not affect the semantics.

Given this understanding, the resolution involves ensuring that all intended bindings are included. The `configure()` method should include all the binds from both sides.

Here's the resolution:

```java
    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        bind(IMavenConfiguration.class).toInstance(MavenPlugin.getMavenConfiguration());
        bind(PersistNonRuntimeClasspathConfigurer.class);
        bind(AddNonRuntimeClasspathContainerConfigurer.class);
        bind(RemoveNonRuntimeProjectsConfigurer.class);
        bind(IMaven.class).toInstance(MavenPlugin.getMaven());
        bind(BuildPathManager.class);
    }

    @Provides
    List<RawClasspathConfigurer> provideRawClasspathConfigurers(PersistNonRuntimeClasspathConfigurer persistConfigurer,
```

Since we've resolved the conflict by including all the relevant bindings and preserved the original context and spacing as requested, here is the output in markdown code syntax:

```java
    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        bind(IMavenConfiguration.class).toInstance(MavenPlugin.getMavenConfiguration());
        bind(PersistNonRuntimeClasspathConfigurer.class);
        bind(AddNonRuntimeClasspathContainerConfigurer.class);
        bind(RemoveNonRuntimeProjectsConfigurer.class);
        bind(IMaven.class).toInstance(MavenPlugin.getMaven());
        bind(BuildPathManager.class);
    }

    @Provides
    List<RawClasspathConfigurer> provideRawClasspathConfigurers(PersistNonRuntimeClasspathConfigurer persistConfigurer,
```
