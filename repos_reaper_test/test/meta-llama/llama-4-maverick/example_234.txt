To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides.

The code snippet is from a Java class `TextLoader` that implements `LoadFunc`. It appears to be part of a data processing or loading mechanism. The class has a `BufferedPositionedInputStream` object `in`, a `Charset` object `utf8` set to "UTF8", and a `long` variable `end`.

The conflict arises from the declaration and initialization of variables. The local changes (`HEAD`) have the `end` variable declared as `long                end;`, while the incoming changes (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) have it declared as `long end;` followed by the declaration and initialization of a `TupleFactory` object `mTupleFactory`.

Let's examine the intent behind both versions:

1. The `HEAD` version focuses on the `end` variable without introducing any new variables.
2. The incoming version (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) not only has a differently formatted declaration of `end` (without the extra spaces) but also introduces a `TupleFactory` instance, `mTupleFactory`.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand if both changes are necessary and how they relate to the functionality of `TextLoader`.

- The `end` variable is used in the `bindTo` method, and its declaration is essential. The difference in spacing is not semantically significant.
- The introduction of `mTupleFactory` suggests an additional functionality or requirement that wasn't present in the `HEAD` version. This could be related to creating tuples, possibly for data processing purposes.

Since there's no indication that the introduction of `mTupleFactory` conflicts with the existing functionality or that it's redundant, and assuming it's needed for some other part of the class (not shown in this snippet), we should include it.

The resolved code snippet, presented in markdown code syntax without modifying the context or spacing as much as the conflict markers allow, is:

```java
 * contains the line of text.
 */
public class TextLoader implements LoadFunc{
    BufferedPositionedInputStream in;
    final private static Charset utf8 = Charset.forName("UTF8");
    long end;
    private TupleFactory mTupleFactory = TupleFactory.getInstance();

    public void bindTo(String fileName, BufferedPositionedInputStream in, long offset, long end) throws IOException {
        this.in = in;
        this.end = end;
        // Since we are not block aligned we throw away the first
```
