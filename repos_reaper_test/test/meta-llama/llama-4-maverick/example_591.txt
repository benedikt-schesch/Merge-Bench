To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The original code snippet is in Java and represents a part of the Javadoc comment for an abstract class named `BaseFacebookClient`. The conflict arises from the differing descriptions of the class's purpose in the Javadoc comment.

On one side of the merge (represented by `HEAD`), the class is described as containing data and functionality from `DefaultFacebookClient`. On the other side (represented by the commit `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`), the description is more inclusive, stating that the class contains data and functionality common to both `DefaultFacebookClient` and `DefaultLegacyFacebookClient`.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we should consider the intent behind both changes. The change in `HEAD` seems to focus on `DefaultFacebookClient`, possibly indicating that the class's primary or initial purpose was related to this client. The other side, however, broadens the scope to include `DefaultLegacyFacebookClient`, suggesting that the class now serves as a base for both clients, indicating a potential expansion or refactoring of the class's role.

Given the information, the more comprehensive and inclusive description is likely to be the more accurate or up-to-date intent, as it reflects a broader applicability of the `BaseFacebookClient` class. Thus, the description that includes both `DefaultFacebookClient` and `DefaultLegacyFacebookClient` is semantically more informative and likely aligns with the current functionality or design intent.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:
