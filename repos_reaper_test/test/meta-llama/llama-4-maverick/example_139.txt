To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles job statistics and exceptions. The snippet includes a comparator for `JobStats` objects based on their `jobId` and a method `setBackendException` that logs error messages based on the type of exception encountered.

The merge conflict arises from the introduction of the `@Private` annotation on the `setBackendException` method. The conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`) indicate that the change (addition of `@Private`) is made in the branch being merged (`f6a8f7aa42cae344f71cc6759f1c7880b49211fc`) but is not present in the current branch (`HEAD`).

To resolve this conflict, we must understand the intent behind the `@Private` annotation. Typically, such annotations are used to indicate that a method or class is intended for internal use only and should not be accessed directly from outside the package or module where it's defined.

1. **Understanding the Intent**: The intent behind adding `@Private` to `setBackendException` is likely to denote that this method is not part of the public API and is intended for internal use within the class or package.

2. **Analyzing the Context**: The surrounding code doesn't directly indicate why `setBackendException` needs to be marked as `@Private`. However, it's reasonable to assume that this method is part of the internal logic for handling job-related exceptions and is not meant to be exposed publicly.

3. **Resolving the Conflict**: To resolve the conflict, we need to decide whether the `setBackendException` method should be annotated with `@Private`. If the intent is to keep this method as part of the internal implementation, we should accept the change. Otherwise, if there's a reason to keep it without the annotation (e.g., it's part of a public API or there's a specific requirement against such annotations), we should reject the change.

Given the information and focusing on the semantics and intent:

```java
        public int compare(JobStats o1, JobStats o2) {
            return o1.getJobId().compareTo(o2.getJobId());
        }
    }

    @Private
    public void setBackendException(String jobId, Exception e) {
        if (e instanceof PigException) {
            LOG.error("ERROR " + ((PigException)e).getErrorCode() + ": "
                    + e.getLocalizedMessage());
        } else if (e != null) {
```
