```java
				"EMAIL:cookiemonster@sesamestreet.com\n" + //
				"ADR:Sesamestreet 1\n" + //
				"NOTE:more cookies, please\n" + //
				"END:VCARD");
		assertNotNull(scheme);
		assertThat("wrong type", scheme, instanceOf(VCard.class));
		VCard vcard = (VCard) scheme;
		assertEquals("Cookiemonster", vcard.getName());
		assertEquals("Sesamestreet 1", vcard.getAddress());
		assertEquals("CTV", vcard.getCompany());
		assertEquals("cookiemonster@sesamestreet.com", vcard.getEmail());

``` 
The two conflicting sides are checking if the `scheme` is an instance of `VCard`. The left-hand side (HEAD) does this with a simple assertion, while the right-hand side (7d8e78a) adds a custom error message "wrong type" to the assertion. The intent behind both is the same - to verify that `scheme` is of type `VCard`. The right-hand side provides more informative output in case of a test failure by including the custom error message. Therefore, I have resolved the conflict by taking the change from the right-hand side, which is more informative and thus preferable.
