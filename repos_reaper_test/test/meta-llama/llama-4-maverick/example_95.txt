To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a test for a `gameManager` class, which manages a collection of games. The test removes a game, adds a new game with the same ID, and then performs some assertions to verify the behavior of the `gameManager`.

The conflict arises when adding a new game with ID `1`. The two versions of the code differ in the parameters passed to the `Game` constructor.

The `HEAD` version (left side of the conflict) creates a new `Game` object with the following parameters:
```java
new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
        formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider)
```

The `ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967` version (right side of the conflict) creates a new `Game` object with an additional parameter:
```java
new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
        formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider)
```

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the additional parameter. The parameter `falseProvider` is added in the same position as the existing `falseProvider` parameters, suggesting that it serves a similar purpose. The new parameter at the end, `gameOptionsProvider`, is likely a new dependency or configuration option for the `Game` class.

Assuming that the `Game` class has been updated to accept this new parameter, and considering that both sides of the merge are trying to test the `gameManager` with a valid `Game` object, the resolution should include the new parameter.

The resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax is:
```java

    // remove game 1 out from under it, to make sure it'll fix itself
    gameManager.getGames().remove(1);
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
    gameManager.getGames().put(1,
        new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));
    assertEquals(-1, gameManager.get().intValue());

    gameManager.destroyGame(2);
    gameManager.destroyGame(0);
    assertEquals(2, gameManager.get().intValue());

```
