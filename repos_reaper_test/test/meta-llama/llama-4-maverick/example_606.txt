To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class definition for a Facebook type, specifically `MailingAddress`, which extends `AbstractFacebookType`. The conflict arises in the declaration of the `serialVersionUID` field.

On the left side of the conflict (`HEAD`), we have a declaration of `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;`. This line is used to define a unique identifier for the class, which is used during the serialization process. Serialization is the process of converting an object's state to a byte stream in such a way that the byte stream can be reverted back into a Java object at a later point of time. The `serialVersionUID` is crucial for ensuring that the class is compatible during the serialization and deserialization processes.

On the right side of the conflict (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`), the `serialVersionUID` declaration is absent.

To resolve this conflict, we should consider the intent behind both changes. 

1. The presence of `serialVersionUID` on the left side (`HEAD`) suggests that the class is intended to be serialized, and a version has been explicitly defined to manage the serialization compatibility.
   
2. The absence of `serialVersionUID` on the right side (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`) could imply either that the class is not intended for serialization (or the intent is to rely on the compiler to generate a default `serialVersionUID`), or it might simply be an omission.

Given that `MailingAddress` extends `AbstractFacebookType`, it's plausible that serialization is a relevant operation for this class hierarchy, as many frameworks and libraries utilize serialization.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the likely intent of both sides, we should check if there's a compelling reason to remove or keep the `serialVersionUID`. 

Since the removal of `serialVersionUID` could potentially change the serialization behavior (as the JVM will generate one automatically if it's not provided), and assuming that `AbstractFacebookType` might be serializable (given the context), it's generally safer to keep an explicit `serialVersionUID` if it was previously defined, unless there's a specific reason to change this behavior.

Therefore, the resolution involves deciding whether the explicit definition of `serialVersionUID` is necessary or not. If we choose to keep it, we are maintaining the explicit control over the serialization version. If we remove it, we're relying on the JVM to generate a `serialVersionUID`, which could potentially lead to issues if the class structure changes in a way that's not backward compatible.

Here is the resolution with the conflict markers removed, choosing to keep the `serialVersionUID` as it was on the `HEAD` side, assuming serialization is intended and explicit version control is beneficial:

```java

  }

  public static class MailingAddress extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * The mailing address ID.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
```

This choice preserves the explicit `serialVersionUID` definition, maintaining control over the serialization versioning. 

However, if the intent behind removing `serialVersionUID` on the other branch is to indicate that this class should not be serialized or should rely on the JVM-generated `serialVersionUID`, further investigation into the design and requirements of the `MailingAddress` class and its usage within the application would be necessary to make an informed decision.

Since my explanation leaned towards preserving the explicit `serialVersionUID` due to its potential importance in serialization, the final resolved code snippet remains:

```java

  }

  public static class MailingAddress extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * The mailing address ID.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
```
