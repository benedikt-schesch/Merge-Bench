To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The original code snippet is in Java and involves importing various classes from the `br.com.caelum.vraptor` package and Google's Gson library. The conflict arises from the addition of different import statements in the two branches being merged.

The `HEAD` branch (typically representing the current branch being worked on) has added an import for `br.com.caelum.vraptor.util.ISO8601Util`. On the other hand, the branch being merged into `HEAD` (identified by the commit hash `e2ba4704971f22e8d6c1ef0933f04d288b8c3f4b`) has added an import for `br.com.caelum.vraptor.view.GenericController`.

Both imports are independent of each other; they import different classes from different packages. The addition of `ISO8601Util` suggests the use of a utility class for handling ISO 8601 date and time formats, potentially for serialization or deserialization purposes, given the context of the surrounding imports related to Gson. The `GenericController` import implies the use of a controller class, possibly a fallback or a generic implementation for handling requests or views.

Since both imports serve different purposes and do not conflict with each other semantically or syntactically, the most logical resolution is to include both imports in the merged code.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.resource.DefaultResourceClass;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.resource.DefaultResourceMethod;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.resource.ResourceClass;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.resource.ResourceMethod;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.serialization.gson.adapters.CalendarDeserializer;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.util.ISO8601Util;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.view.GenericController;

import com.google.gson.JsonDeserializationContext;
import com.google.gson.JsonDeserializer;
import com.google.gson.JsonElement;
import com.google.gson.JsonParseException;
