To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a part of a Java class `POStore` that extends `PhysicalOperator`. The conflicting lines involve the declaration and initialization of a static variable `empty` of type `Result`.

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
    protected static Result empty = new Result(POStatus.STATUS_NULL, null);
=======
    private static Result empty = new Result(POStatus.STATUS_NULL, null);
>>>>>>> 5e2f75cb9f2d357f135a4cb3d2f905fb78fa9d40
```

The conflict arises because the `empty` variable is declared as `protected static` in the local branch (`HEAD`) and as `private static` in the branch being merged (`5e2f75cb9f2d357f135a4cb3d2f905fb78fa9d40`).

1. **Understanding the Intent**: 
   - The `protected` access modifier means the variable can be accessed within its class and by subclasses.
   - The `private` access modifier restricts the access to the variable within its class only, not even to subclasses.

2. **Semantic Analysis**: 
   - The change from `protected static` to `private static` reduces the visibility of the `empty` variable. This could imply that the maintainers of the branch `5e2f75cb9f2d357f135a4cb3d2f905fb78fa9d40` decided that `empty` should not be directly accessed by subclasses, possibly to encapsulate it or to avoid potential misuse.

3. **Resolution**:
   - To resolve the conflict, we need to understand whether the intent is to keep `empty` accessible to subclasses or to restrict its access.
   - If the intent is to restrict access to `empty` and there's a valid reason (like encapsulation or avoiding misuse), changing it to `private static` might be the correct choice.
   - However, if subclasses rely on accessing `empty` directly, changing it to `private static` could break functionality.

Given the information and analyzing the semantics, if we choose to resolve by considering encapsulation (a common practice to restrict unnecessary access), the resolution would lean towards making `empty` `private`. However, without knowing the specific requirements or the broader context of how `POStore` is used and subclassed, it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict.

Since the change involves reducing the visibility of a member variable, and without further context on whether subclasses depend on accessing `empty`, a cautious approach would be to preserve the conflict or analyze further. However, I will directly resolve it based on the given instructions and the fact that reducing visibility is a common refactoring step for encapsulation.

Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax, without modifying the context and preserving the spacing as is:

```java
 *
 */
public class POStore extends PhysicalOperator {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private static Result empty = new Result(POStatus.STATUS_NULL, null);
    transient private StoreFuncInterface storer;
    transient private POStoreImpl impl;
    transient private String counterName = null;
    private FileSpec sFile;
    private Schema schema;

```

If unsure, the original conflicted snippet would be returned as is. However, based on the step-by-step analysis and choosing to encapsulate `empty` by making it `private`, the above resolution is provided.
