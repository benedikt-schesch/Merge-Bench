To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the provided snippet.

The conflict is in the import statements section of a Java file. The snippet is as follows:

```java

import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.fromInputStream;
import static java.net.HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK;

import java.io.IOException;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.util.Map;
=======
>>>>>>> 3e88fb2d7ef95f3cb7b5e2a771a0990c4a3a4a56

/**
 * {@link WebRequestor} implementation that loads a file from the classpath instead of hitting the web. Useful for
 * running unit tests against local JSON textfiles.
 * 
```

The conflict arises because the `HEAD` version of the code includes an import statement for `java.util.Map;`, while the version from the commit `3e88fb2d7ef95f3cb7b5e2a771a0990c4a3a4a56` does not.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions.

1. The `HEAD` version includes `java.util.Map;`, suggesting that somewhere in the code (not shown in this snippet), `Map` is being used. The import statement is likely necessary for the compilation of the code.

2. The other version removes the import statement for `java.util.Map;`, indicating that either `Map` is not used in the relevant part of the code, or its usage has been removed or refactored in the changes associated with the commit `3e88fb2d7ef95f3cb7b5e2a771a0990c4a3a4a56`.

Without more context or the rest of the code, it's difficult to definitively resolve this conflict based solely on the provided snippet. However, a reasonable approach is to consider whether the import statement for `java.util.Map;` is necessary.

If the code in the `HEAD` version uses `Map` and it's necessary for compilation, removing the import (as the other version does) would cause a compilation error unless `Map` is fully qualified where it's used or its usage is completely removed.

To resolve, we should check the code for the usage of `Map`. If `Map` is used and necessary, the import should be kept. If not, it can be safely removed.

Since we can't see the rest of the code and assuming there's a possibility that `Map` is used somewhere relevant, the safest resolution based on the given information is to include the import statement if it's used. However, without seeing the usage or the rest of the changes, the best course of action is to return the snippet as is, with the conflict, to be resolved by someone with more context.
