To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made in both branches.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a JSON serialization or deserialization process, specifically handling the serialization of a `decimal` value using a `jsonGenerator`. The conflict arises from changes made in two different branches (represented by `HEAD` and the commit `bdcc9aaa22f9470ce4d424736aabbc49c4857931`).

The code in the `bdcc9aaa22f9470ce4d424736aabbc49c4857931` commit includes a block that writes a decimal value to a JSON object using `jsonGenerator`. The relevant part of the code is as follows:
```java
jsonGenerator.writeStartObject();
jsonGenerator.writeFieldName("$numberDecimal");
jsonGenerator.writeString(decimal.bigDecimalValue().toString());
jsonGenerator.writeEndObject();
```

The conflict occurs because the `HEAD` branch contains an `else` clause that calls `handleUnsupportedGenerator(jsonGenerator)` after the serialization of the decimal value, while the other branch (`bdcc9aaa22f9470ce4d424736aabbc49c4857931`) does not have this `else` clause.

Let's analyze the intent:
- The code in `bdcc9aaa22f9470ce4d424736aabbc49c4857931` focuses on serializing a decimal value into a JSON object with a specific structure.
- The `HEAD` branch's change introduces a call to `handleUnsupportedGenerator(jsonGenerator)` in an `else` clause, suggesting that there might be a condition under which the `jsonGenerator` is not supported, and this needs to be handled.

The condition for the `if` statement is not shown in the provided snippet, so we can't directly infer the logic. However, we can infer that the `if` condition is related to whether the `decimal` value is being handled or if the `jsonGenerator` supports certain operations.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider what happens when the condition is not met (i.e., the `else` clause). The `HEAD` branch suggests that in such a case, it should call `handleUnsupportedGenerator(jsonGenerator)`, implying that there's a scenario where the generator is not supported or the value cannot be serialized as intended.

Given the information and focusing on preserving the intent and semantics of both changes, the resolution involves deciding whether the `else` clause is necessary or not. If the condition before the `jsonGenerator.writeStartObject();` line is such that it correctly handles or filters out unsupported generators or values, then the `else` clause might be redundant. However, without the exact condition or more context, it's challenging to definitively remove it.

Since the intent is not entirely clear without more context (like the condition being checked before writing to `jsonGenerator`), and to avoid potentially removing necessary logic, the safest approach is to preserve both intents.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict resolved by preserving the changes from both branches, presented in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
>>>>>>> bdcc9aaa22f9470ce4d424736aabbc49c4857931
                jsonGenerator.writeStartObject();
                jsonGenerator.writeFieldName("$numberDecimal");
                jsonGenerator.writeString(decimal.bigDecimalValue().toString());
                jsonGenerator.writeEndObject();
            } else {
                handleUnsupportedGenerator(jsonGenerator);
>>>>>>> bdcc9aaa22f9470ce4d424736aabbc49c4857931
            }
        }
    }
