To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The context is a Java code snippet that appears to be part of a larger system responsible for generating HTML attributes based on certain actions and their properties. The specific section of code is within a switch statement that handles different cases based on the type of action being processed.

The conflict arises between the lines marked by `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5`. 

On the left side (`HEAD`), there is a case for `"inline-text-message"` that retrieves a delay property from the `triggeredAction` and appends it as a data attribute (`data-structr-success-notifications-delay`) to the output.

On the right side (`d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5`), this case is entirely removed.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both versions.

1. The version on the left (`HEAD`) is handling the `"inline-text-message"` case by including a delay attribute. This suggests that the system is designed to display inline text messages with a delay, and the delay is configurable through the `triggeredAction` properties.

2. The version on the right (`d72e83e2638205c5015a1f9cb06ac4df592921c5`) removes this handling, potentially indicating that the delay attribute is either not needed, or its configuration is handled elsewhere or in a different manner.

Without additional context about why the `"inline-text-message"` case was removed in the right side, the safest approach to resolve the conflict is to consider whether both changes are semantically valid and necessary.

If the removal of the `"inline-text-message"` case on the right side is intended to remove the functionality or indicate it's handled differently, and there's a valid reason for this removal (e.g., the delay is now handled elsewhere or is no longer necessary), then the conflict resolution would lean towards removing this case.

However, if the intent is to preserve the functionality for handling `"inline-text-message"` with a delay, then the code on the left should be retained.

Given the information available and focusing on the intent and semantics:

```java
					out.append(" data-structr-success-notifications-custom-dialog-element=\"").append(generateDataAttributesForIdList(renderContext, triggeredAction, ActionMapping.successNotificationElements)).append("\"");
					break;

				case "fire-event":
					out.append(" data-structr-success-notifications-event=\"").append(triggeredAction.getProperty(ActionMapping.successNotificationsEventProperty)).append("\"");
					break;

				case "inline-text-message":
					final Integer delay = triggeredAction.getProperty(StructrApp.key(ActionMapping.class, "successNotificationsDelay"));
					out.append(" data-structr-success-notifications-delay=\"").append(delay.toString()).append("\"");
					break;

				default:
					break;
```
