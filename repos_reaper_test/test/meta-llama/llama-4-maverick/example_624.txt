To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class definition, specifically a nested static class named `Targeting` that extends `AbstractFacebookType`. The context suggests it's part of a library or framework that interacts with Facebook's Graph API, given the presence of `@RestFB.GraphApi.Since 2.8`.

The merge conflict arises from the difference in the `serialVersionUID` declaration. 

- The version from `HEAD` (typically the local branch being worked on) includes a declaration for `serialVersionUID` with a value of `1L`. This suggests that the class `Targeting` is intended to be serializable, as `serialVersionUID` is used by Java's serialization mechanism to verify the compatibility of the class during the serialization and deserialization process.

- The version from `a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe` (the other branch being merged) does not include any `serialVersionUID` declaration.

To resolve this conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both versions:

1. **Including `serialVersionUID`**: By declaring `serialVersionUID`, the developer is explicitly defining the version of the class for serialization purposes. This is a good practice, especially if the class is expected to be serialized (e.g., saved to a file, sent over a network). The value `1L` indicates the initial version of the class.

2. **Omitting `serialVersionUID`**: If `serialVersionUID` is not explicitly declared, Java will generate one automatically based on the class's structure (fields, methods, etc.). This can lead to issues if the class is modified later (e.g., fields are added or removed), as the generated `serialVersionUID` will change, potentially breaking compatibility with previously serialized instances.

Given these considerations, both versions have valid intents. However, the version with `serialVersionUID` explicitly declared is generally safer and more controlled in terms of serialization compatibility.

The resolution should prioritize maintaining the class's intended functionality and ensuring compatibility. Since `Targeting` extends `AbstractFacebookType`, it's plausible that serialization is relevant (many frameworks and libraries use serialization for various purposes).

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
    }
  }

  public static class Targeting extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * @RestFB.GraphApi.Since 2.8
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
```
