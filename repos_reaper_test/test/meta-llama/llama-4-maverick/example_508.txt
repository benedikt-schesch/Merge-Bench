To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced on both sides of the conflict.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a graphics rendering or game development application, utilizing a library such as AndEngine, given the use of `SpriteBatch`, `BitmapTextureAtlas`, and `TextureRegion`.

The conflict arises in the line where a `SpriteBatch` object named `staticSpriteBatch` is created. The conflict is between `this.mBitmapTexture` and `this.mBitmapTextureAtlas` as the first argument to the `SpriteBatch` constructor.

Let's analyze the intent and semantics:
1. **Left Side (HEAD):** `final SpriteBatch staticSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTexture, 2);` suggests that `staticSpriteBatch` is being initialized with a texture (`mBitmapTexture`) and a buffer size or capacity of 2.
   
2. **Right Side (91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d):** `final SpriteBatch staticSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, 2);` indicates a similar initialization but with `mBitmapTextureAtlas` instead.

The variable names `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas` imply different types or uses. Typically, a `Texture` refers to a raw texture image, while a `TextureAtlas` is a larger image that contains multiple smaller textures or sprites. The `SpriteBatch` constructor likely expects a texture or atlas that it will use to render the sprites.

Given the subsequent lines of code:
```java
staticSpriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, -50, 0, this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth(), this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight(), 2, 2);
staticSpriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, 50, 0, this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth(), this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight(), 45);
```
It's clear that `mFaceTextureRegion` is being drawn. The fact that a `TextureRegion` is being used suggests that the original texture or atlas is expected to contain or be related to this region.

Since `mFaceTextureRegion` is likely derived from or associated with a `TextureAtlas` (as is common in game engines and graphical applications where multiple sprites are packed into a single atlas for efficiency), and given that the change on the right side uses `mBitmapTextureAtlas`, it is plausible that `mBitmapTextureAtlas` is the correct or intended parameter.

However, without knowing the exact definitions or relationships between `mBitmapTexture` and `mBitmapTextureAtlas`, or their initialization and usage elsewhere in the code, it's challenging to definitively resolve the conflict based solely on the given snippet.

That said, in many graphics and game development contexts, using a `TextureAtlas` is a common and efficient practice for rendering multiple sprites. Thus, the change to use `mBitmapTextureAtlas` might be semantically correct if `mFaceTextureRegion` is derived from it.

To preserve the spacing and not modify the context, and given the analysis above, I will return the entire snippet with the conflict resolved based on the likely intent:

```java
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
				this.draw(faceSprite2);
			}
		};
		
		final SpriteBatch staticSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, 2);
		staticSpriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, -50, 0, this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth(), this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight(), 2, 2);
		staticSpriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, 50, 0, this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth(), this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight(), 45);
		staticSpriteBatch.submit();

		dynamicSpriteBatch.setPosition(centerX, centerY - 50);
```

However, if we strictly follow the instructions and consider that we should not modify the original context unless we're sure of the resolution, the original snippet with the conflict should be returned if there's any ambiguity.

Thus, the response in markdown code syntax as requested is:
```java
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
				this.draw(faceSprite2);
			}
		};
