Upon examining the merge conflict, it appears that both sides are attempting to create a defensive copy of the `players` list. The difference lies in the way the `ArrayList` is initialized.

The left-hand side (HEAD) uses `new ArrayList<Player>(players.size())`, explicitly specifying the type parameter `Player`.

The right-hand side (5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a) uses `new ArrayList<>(players.size())`, utilizing the diamond operator to infer the type parameter.

Both approaches achieve the same goal: creating an `ArrayList` with an initial capacity equal to the size of the `players` list.

Since the diamond operator is a more concise and modern way of achieving the same result, and the type parameter can be inferred by the compiler, I can resolve the conflict by choosing the right-hand side's version. However, to preserve the original intent and avoid potential issues with older Java versions that may not support the diamond operator, I will resolve the conflict.
