To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a Minecraft proxy server, specifically handling a ping event from a client. The conflict arises in the `done` method of a `Callback` object, where two different versions of code are presented.

### Left Side of the Conflict (HEAD)
```java
BungeeCord.getInstance().getConnectionThrottle().unthrottle( getAddress().getAddress() );
Gson gson = handshake.getProtocolVersion() == ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_7_2 ? BungeeCord.getInstance().gsonLegacy : BungeeCord.getInstance().gson;
```

The left side (HEAD) does two things:
1. It unthrottles the connection based on the client's address, presumably to manage or limit the frequency of connections from the same address.
2. It selects a `Gson` object based on the protocol version of the handshake. If the version is Minecraft 1.7.2, it uses `gsonLegacy`; otherwise, it uses `gson`. This suggests handling differences in JSON serialization or deserialization between Minecraft versions.

### Right Side of the Conflict (80b3135a93f0e23489cc19086e31feb12ff51798)
```java
Gson gson = BungeeCord.getInstance().gson;
```

The right side simply assigns the `gson` object from `BungeeCord.getInstance()` to the `gson` variable, without considering the protocol version. This implies a simplification or change in how JSON serialization is handled, potentially removing version-specific handling.

### Analysis and Resolution

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. The left side maintains version-specific `Gson` handling and includes a connection throttle unthrottling step. The right side simplifies the `Gson` selection, potentially indicating that version-specific `Gson` handling is no longer necessary or has been handled differently elsewhere.

If we prioritize the left side's changes, we keep both the unthrottling and the version-specific `Gson` handling. If we prioritize the right side, we lose the version-specific handling but potentially gain a simplification in `Gson` usage.

Without additional context on why the right side simplifies the `Gson` selection, and considering the potential importance of both unthrottling the connection and handling different Minecraft versions, a conservative resolution would be to incorporate both the unthrottling and a `Gson` selection strategy.

However, directly combining both sides as is could result in:
```java
BungeeCord.getInstance().getConnectionThrottle().unthrottle( getAddress().getAddress() );
Gson gson = BungeeCord.getInstance().gson;
```

This resolves the conflict by taking the `Gson` assignment from the right side and preserving the unthrottling line from the left side. It assumes that the simplification in `Gson` handling is correct and that unthrottling remains necessary.

### Resolved Snippet

```java
                Callback<ProxyPingEvent> callback = new Callback<ProxyPingEvent>()
                {
                    @Override
                    public void done(ProxyPingEvent pingResult, Throwable error)
                    {
                        BungeeCord.getInstance().getConnectionThrottle().unthrottle( getAddress().getAddress() );
                        Gson gson = BungeeCord.getInstance().gson;
                        unsafe.sendPacket( new StatusResponse( gson.toJson( pingResult.getResponse() ) ) );
                    }
                };

                bungee.getPluginManager().callEvent( new ProxyPingEvent( InitialHandler.this, result, callback ) );
```
