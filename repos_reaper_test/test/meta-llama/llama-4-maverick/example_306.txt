To resolve this merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The provided snippet is in Java and appears to be part of an `onActivityResult` method, likely within an Android application given the use of `requestCode`, `resultCode`, and `RESULT_OK`. The method checks if the `requestCode` and `resultCode` match certain expected values (`TLOG_PICKER_REQUEST_CODE` and `RESULT_OK`, respectively). If they don't match, it calls the superclass's `onActivityResult` method and returns.

The conflict is between the lines:
```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
//        //Get the file's absolute path from the incoming intent
=======
//        //Get the file's absolute path from the incoming intent
>>>>>>> e09ee671a059143adc0ae222d4caab742508cad7
```
Upon closer inspection, it's evident that both sides of the conflict are commenting out the same line (or block of code), with the difference being that the version from `HEAD` keeps the line commented out, while the version from `e09ee671a059143adc0ae222d4caab742508cad7` also keeps it commented out but includes the comment itself without any actual code change related to the conflict markers.

The code snippet that is commented out (but shown here as if it were not commented out for clarity) is:
```java
//        final String tlogAbsolutePath = returnIntent.getStringExtra(ServiceDataContract.EXTRA_TLOG_ABSOLUTE_PATH);
//        
//        if (tlogOpener != null)
//            tlogOpener.cancel(true);
```

Both versions are effectively doing the same thing - keeping the relevant lines commented out. There's no actual code change between the two versions within the conflict; the conflict markers indicate a difference where there isn't a significant semantic difference in terms of code execution.

Therefore, the intent of both sides seems to be to keep the code related to getting the file's absolute path and potentially cancelling `tlogOpener` commented out.

To resolve this, since there's effectively no change between the two versions (as both keep the relevant code commented out), one could simply remove the conflict markers. The resulting code would be:

```java
        if (requestCode != TLOG_PICKER_REQUEST_CODE || resultCode != RESULT_OK) {
            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, returnIntent);
            return;
        }

//        //Get the file's absolute path from the incoming intent
//        final String tlogAbsolutePath = returnIntent.getStringExtra(ServiceDataContract.EXTRA_TLOG_ABSOLUTE_PATH);
//
//        if (tlogOpener != null)
//            tlogOpener.cancel(true);
//
```

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
        if (requestCode != TLOG_PICKER_REQUEST_CODE || resultCode != RESULT_OK) {
            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, returnIntent);
            return;
        }

//        //Get the file's absolute path from the incoming intent
//        final String tlogAbsolutePath = returnIntent.getStringExtra(ServiceDataContract.EXTRA_TLOG_ABSOLUTE_PATH);
//
//        if (tlogOpener != null)
//            tlogOpener.cancel(true);
//
```
