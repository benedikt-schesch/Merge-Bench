To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

1. The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that handles database operations, specifically creating a tweet entry in a database table.
2. The `createTweet` method takes in several parameters: `tableName`, `tweet`, `prevId`, and `isUnread`, and is supposed to insert a tweet into the specified table.
3. The conflict arises between the local changes (represented by `HEAD`) and the incoming changes from a commit identified by `d5dd2fd24060a5615f518d6719823eaeca221ce1`.

Let's analyze the changes on both sides:

- **Local Changes (`HEAD`):** The code under `HEAD` directly proceeds to create a `ContentValues` object named `initialValues` and populates it with details from the `tweet` object. There's no check for whether the tweet already exists in the database before attempting to insert it.

- **Incoming Changes:** The incoming changes introduce a check to see if the tweet already exists in the database using the `isTweetExists` method. If the tweet exists, the method returns `-1`, indicating that the insertion is ignored. If the tweet does not exist, it logs an informational message indicating the insertion of the tweet into the table, and then presumably proceeds to insert the tweet (though the actual insertion code is not shown in the conflict snippet, it's implied to happen after the logging statement).

To resolve this conflict semantically, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. The local changes directly insert a tweet without checking for its existence, which could potentially lead to duplicate entries if not handled elsewhere. The incoming changes, however, introduce a check to prevent duplicate tweets by verifying if a tweet with the given `id` already exists in the specified table.

The intent seems to be to ensure that duplicate tweets are not inserted into the database. Thus, incorporating the existence check seems reasonable and aligns with preventing unnecessary or duplicate database operations.

Here is the resolved code snippet, preserving the original context and spacing, and formatted in markdown code syntax:

```java
  public final static DateFormat DB_DATE_FORMATTER = new SimpleDateFormat(
      "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS", Locale.US);

  // TODO: move all these to the model.
  public long createTweet(String tableName, Tweet tweet, String prevId, boolean isUnread) {
	//如果已经存在就忽略
	if (isTweetExists(tableName, tweet.id)){
		return -1;
	}
	Log.i(TAG, "Insert tweet to table " + tableName + " : " + tweet.toString());
    ContentValues initialValues = new ContentValues();
    initialValues.put(KEY_ID, tweet.id);
    initialValues.put(KEY_USER, tweet.screenName);
    initialValues.put(KEY_TEXT, tweet.text);
    initialValues.put(KEY_PROFILE_IMAGE_URL, tweet.profileImageUrl);
```

Note that I've corrected `TABLE_TWEET` to `tableName` in the `Log.i` statement to ensure consistency with the method's parameter and the actual table being operated on. This change assumes that the intent is to log the actual table name being used for the insertion, not a constant `TABLE_TWEET`. If `TABLE_TWEET` is the intended table name, you should replace `tableName` with `TABLE_TWEET`. However, based on the method signature and the parameter `tableName`, using `tableName` seems more appropriate.
