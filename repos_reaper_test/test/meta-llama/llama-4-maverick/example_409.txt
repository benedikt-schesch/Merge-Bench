To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is a JUnit test method named `parseAsciidocFileWithPrettifyAttribute`, which appears to be testing the parsing of an Asciidoc file with a specific attribute (`source-highlighter=prettify`) using a parser.

The conflict arises from the differences in how the `config` object's property is set and the type of the `map` variable.

1. **Left side of the conflict (HEAD):**
   - The property is set using `JBakeProperty.ASCIIDOCTOR_ATTRIBUTES` as the key.
   - The `map` variable is of type `DocumentModel`.

2. **Right side of the conflict (d68ddea7554653e7928d220f68a3af13bfb30cdb):**
   - The property is set using `ASCIIDOCTOR_ATTRIBUTES.getKey()` as the key.
   - The `map` variable is of type `Map<String, Object>`.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes on both sides.

- The change in the key used to set the property on the `config` object could be due to a refactoring or a change in how the attribute keys are managed. `JBakeProperty.ASCIIDOCTOR_ATTRIBUTES` and `ASCIIDOCTOR_ATTRIBUTES.getKey()` might be equivalent, or they might represent different approaches to accessing the same attribute key.
- The change in the type of `map` from `DocumentModel` to `Map<String, Object>` could indicate a change in how the result of `parser.processFile(asciidocWithSource)` is handled or interpreted. `DocumentModel` might be a specific type that extends or wraps `Map<String, Object>`, or it could be a different abstraction altogether.

Given the information and focusing on the semantics and intent:

- If `JBakeProperty.ASCIIDOCTOR_ATTRIBUTES` and `ASCIIDOCTOR_ATTRIBUTES.getKey()` are semantically equivalent (i.e., they represent the same key), the conflict is essentially about the type of `map`.
- The assertions and the usage of `map` suggest that both `DocumentModel` and `Map<String, Object>` are being used in a similar manner, accessing properties like `status`, `type`, and `body`. This implies that `DocumentModel` might be a type that allows such access, possibly through methods or being a `Map` itself.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the intent of both sides, we should look for a common ground.

```java
    @Test
    public void parseAsciidocFileWithPrettifyAttribute() {

        config.setProperty(ASCIIDOCTOR_ATTRIBUTES.getKey(),"source-highlighter=prettify");
        DocumentModel map = (DocumentModel) parser.processFile(asciidocWithSource);
        Assert.assertNotNull(map);
        Assert.assertEquals("draft", map.getStatus());
        Assert.assertEquals("post", map.getType());
        assertThat(map.getBody())
                .contains("class=\"paragraph\"")
```

Here, I've chosen to use `ASCIIDOCTOR_ATTRIBUTES.getKey()` for setting the property, assuming it's the more updated or preferred way of accessing the attribute key. I've also retained `DocumentModel` as the type for `map` because the subsequent assertions and method calls (`getStatus()`, `getType()`, `getBody()`) are specific to `DocumentModel`. If `parser.processFile(asciidocWithSource)` returns a `Map<String, Object>`, I've added a cast to `DocumentModel`, assuming that `DocumentModel` is compatible with the returned type.

If the return type of `parser.processFile(asciidocWithSource)` is not compatible with `DocumentModel`, or if there's any other semantic issue with this resolution, the conflict should be left as is or further investigated.

The resolved snippet in markdown code syntax is:
```java


    @Test
    public void parseAsciidocFileWithPrettifyAttribute() {

        config.setProperty(ASCIIDOCTOR_ATTRIBUTES.getKey(),"source-highlighter=prettify");
        DocumentModel map = (DocumentModel) parser.processFile(asciidocWithSource);
        Assert.assertNotNull(map);
        Assert.assertEquals("draft", map.getStatus());
        Assert.assertEquals("post", map.getType());
        assertThat(map.getBody())
                .contains("class=\"paragraph\"")

```
