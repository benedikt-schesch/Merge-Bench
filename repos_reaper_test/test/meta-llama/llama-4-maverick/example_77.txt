To resolve this merge conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The conflict arises from the import statements for logging libraries. The left side (HEAD) is importing `org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager` and `org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger`, which suggests the use of Log4j 2.x for logging. On the other hand, the right side is importing `org.apache.log4j.Logger`, indicating the use of Log4j 1.x.

First, let's analyze the imports:
- The left side (HEAD) uses Log4j 2.x (`org.apache.logging.log4j`).
- The right side uses Log4j 1.x (`org.apache.log4j`).

The intent seems to be related to logging, and there's a change in the logging library being used or referenced between the two versions.

To resolve this conflict, we need to decide which logging library is intended to be used. 

1. If the project is transitioning to Log4j 2.x, the left side's changes should be kept. 
2. If the project is supposed to use Log4j 1.x, the right side's import should be kept.

However, without more context about the project's logging requirements or the direction it's heading, we can't definitively choose between Log4j 1.x and Log4j 2.x.

Since the left side (HEAD) includes both `LogManager` and `Logger` from Log4j 2.x, and the right side only includes `Logger` from Log4j 1.x, if we choose to go with Log4j 2.x, we should keep the left side's changes. But if the class doesn't use `LogManager`, this might not be the correct choice.

Let's examine the snippet more closely. The presence of `LogManager` on the left side suggests that it might be using some features specific to Log4j 2.x. However, without seeing the actual usage of the `Logger`, we can't be sure.

Given the information and sticking strictly to the task:
