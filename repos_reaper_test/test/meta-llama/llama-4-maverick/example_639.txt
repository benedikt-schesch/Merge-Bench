To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the context and the intent of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class definition for `Thumbnail`, which extends `AbstractFacebookType`. The conflict arises in the declaration of `serialVersionUID`, a field used for serialization purposes in Java.

On one side of the merge (`HEAD`), the code includes a declaration for `serialVersionUID` with a value of `1L`. This suggests that the developers working on this branch intended to explicitly define the version UID for the `Thumbnail` class.

On the other side of the merge (`a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe`), there is no declaration for `serialVersionUID`. This could imply that either the developers did not see a need to explicitly define it, or they were relying on the default serialization behavior.

The intent behind including `serialVersionUID` is typically to control the versioning of the class for serialization purposes. By defining it explicitly, developers can manage how changes to the class affect its serialized form.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand whether the explicit definition of `serialVersionUID` is necessary or if its absence is acceptable. Given that `AbstractFacebookType` likely implements `Serializable` (since `Thumbnail` extends it and has a `serialVersionUID`), and considering best practices for serialization, explicitly defining `serialVersionUID` is generally a good practice. It helps in controlling the serialization version, which can be crucial for maintaining compatibility across different versions of the class.

Since there's no indication that the absence of `serialVersionUID` on one side was due to a deliberate decision to remove or not use it (and given that `HEAD` has made an explicit choice to include it), the most straightforward resolution is to preserve the explicit declaration of `serialVersionUID` as it was in `HEAD`. This approach maintains explicit control over the serialization version.

Therefore, the resolved code snippet, returned in markdown code syntax without modifying the context or spacing, is:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class Thumbnail extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * The name of the thumbnail
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
```
