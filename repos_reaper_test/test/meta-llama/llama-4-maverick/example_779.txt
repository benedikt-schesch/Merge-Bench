To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the code changes involved.

The provided code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a class that interacts with ZooKeeper (ZK), given the presence of `connectZK()` and `getRootRegion()`. The method in question, `retryGetRootRegionLater`, is designed to schedule a retry for getting the root region after some time if an initial attempt fails.

The conflict arises from different modifications made to the `retryGetRootRegionLater` method in two different branches or commits being merged. 

1. The version from `HEAD` (the current branch being worked on) includes a method `retryGetRootRegionLater` that takes an `AsyncCallback.DataCallback cb` as a parameter.
2. The version from the commit `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` (being merged into the current branch) does not include this parameter.

Let's examine the intent and semantics:

- The original method in `HEAD` seems to be designed with the intent of retrying `getRootRegion` and potentially utilizing the provided callback (`cb`) for handling the outcome or continuation of the operation.
- The modified version in `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` removes the `AsyncCallback.DataCallback cb` parameter. This could imply that either the callback is not necessary for the retry logic, or its usage has been refactored elsewhere in the code.

Upon closer inspection, we notice that within the `retryGetRootRegionLater` method, the callback `cb` is not being used in the provided snippet. This could suggest that the removal of `cb` in the other branch is either a refactoring step or an indication that `cb` is not essential for the retry logic as shown.

However, without the full context of how `cb` is intended to be used (or not used) within `retryGetRootRegionLater` or elsewhere in the class, we can't definitively resolve the conflict by simply removing or keeping `cb`.

Given the information and focusing on the semantics and intent:

- If the callback `cb` is crucial for handling the retry or its outcome, removing it might change the functionality.
- If the callback is not used or its usage is not critical within the method or related logic, the change might be a valid refactoring.

To resolve this, one would ideally need to understand the broader context or the specific requirements and changes intended by both versions.

Since the usage of `cb` within the method is not shown, and directly removing it or keeping it could potentially alter the intended functionality, the safest resolution would be to examine further or directly return the conflicting snippet if unsure.

Here is the original snippet preserved in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
        zk = null;
      }
    }

    /** Schedule a timer to retry {@link #getRootRegion} after some time.  */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private void retryGetRootRegionLater(final AsyncCallback.DataCallback cb) {
=======
    private void retryGetRootRegionLater() {
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
      newTimeout(new TimerTask() {
          public void run(final Timeout timeout) {
            if (!getRootRegion()) {  // Try to read the znodes
              connectZK();  // unless we need to connect first.
            }

```
