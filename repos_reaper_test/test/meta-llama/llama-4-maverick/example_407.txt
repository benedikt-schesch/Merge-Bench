To resolve the given merge conflict, we first need to understand the intent and semantics of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet provided is in Java and appears to be part of an Android application, specifically handling the display and interaction of a sign-in/sign-out button within a dialog.

The conflict arises in the lines where the text of a `TextView` with the id `R.id.signedin` is being set. Both versions of the code are attempting to update this `TextView` with a string indicating that the user is signed in, along with their display name.

Let's examine both sides of the conflict:

1. **Left side (HEAD):**
   - It uses `Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer(((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC()).getDisplayName()` to get the current player's display name.
   - This suggests that the `getCurrentPlayer` method is being accessed directly from `Games.Players`, and it's being passed the `GoogleApiClient` instance obtained from `((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC()`.

2. **Right side (467f0adf711b7a96412e01a8f7ba4a578559a3bb):**
   - It uses `((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC().getCurrentPlayer().getDisplayName()` to achieve a similar result.
   - Here, `getCurrentPlayer` is called directly on the `GoogleApiClient` instance (`((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC()`), suggesting that `getGC()` returns an object that has a `getCurrentPlayer` method.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the semantic intent:
- Both sides are trying to display the current player's name after signing in.
- The difference lies in how they access the `getCurrentPlayer` method.

The left side directly accesses it via `Games.Players`, while the right side accesses it through the `GoogleApiClient` instance returned by `getGC()`.

Given the context, the right side seems to be using a more encapsulated or possibly updated API, where `getGC()` (likely a `GoogleApiClient`) directly provides access to `getCurrentPlayer()`. This could indicate a change or refactoring in how the Google Play Games API is being interacted with.

Since both are attempting to achieve the same outcome but through slightly different means, and without further context on the API changes or the exact intent (e.g., whether one is deprecated or more correct than the other), the most straightforward resolution would lean towards the version that is most likely to be correct or up-to-date based on the commit history or the project's evolution.

However, the difference in the two approaches might be significant. The left side uses `Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer`, which directly accesses the current player through the `Games.Players` API. The right side, `getGC().getCurrentPlayer()`, implies that `getGC()` returns an object (presumably a `GoogleApiClient` or a similar entity) that has a method to get the current player.

If we consider the evolution of the Google Play Games API and the fact that the right-hand side is using a potentially more modern or refactored way of accessing the current player (directly through the `GoogleApiClient` or its equivalent), this could be considered the more updated or correct approach.

Thus, resolving the conflict by choosing the right-hand side (and assuming it's the more updated or correct way):

```java
public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
    dialog.dismiss();
}
});
if (((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC().isConnected()) {
    ((TextView) v.findViewById(R.id.signedin))
            .setText(getString(R.string.signed_in, ((MainActivity) getActivity())
                    .getGC().getCurrentPlayer().getDisplayName()));
    v.findViewById(R.id.sign_in_button).setVisibility(View.GONE);
    builder.setPositiveButton(R.string.sign_out, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
            ((MainActivity) getActivity()).signOut();
```
