To resolve the given merge conflict, we need to analyze the changes made in both the source and target branches and understand their intent.

The conflict arises in the definition of `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS`. Let's examine the changes:

1. **Source Branch (HEAD) Change**: The source branch defines `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS` with a pattern that includes `+` after `[^&/" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS + "]`, indicating one or more characters that are not `&`, `/`, or within `HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS`. The pattern is compiled with `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE`.

2. **Target Branch (d6ea7853a09493092b1bb2d192f5823b37007994) Change**: The target branch also defines `AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS` but with a slightly different pattern. It removes the `+` after `[^&/" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS + "]`, indicating exactly one character that is not `&`, `/`, or within `HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS`. Additionally, it compiles the pattern with both `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE` and `Pattern.UNICODE_CASE`.

The key differences are:
- The quantifier (`+`) after the character class before the hashtag symbol.
- The addition of `Pattern.UNICODE_CASE` in the target branch's version.

To resolve this conflict, we must consider the intent behind these changes. The source branch's version allows for one or more characters before the hashtag that are not in `HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS`, while the target branch's version allows for exactly one such character but also considers Unicode case sensitivity.

Since the target branch introduces `Pattern.UNICODE_CASE`, which is a more inclusive and modern approach to handling case sensitivity across different Unicode characters, and removes the `+` quantifier, we need to assess if these changes are complementary or if one is preferred over the other.

Given the information and focusing on semantic intent:
- The removal of `+` might be intended to ensure that the pattern matches the hashtag more strictly, potentially fixing a bug or improving specificity.
- The addition of `Pattern.UNICODE_CASE` improves the pattern's ability to match characters across different Unicode cases, enhancing the overall robustness and inclusivity of the hashtag matching.

To resolve the conflict while preserving the semantic intent of both changes, we could consider incorporating both the stricter matching (`removing +`) and the Unicode case sensitivity.

Here is the resolution:

```java
  /* Begin public constants */
  public static final Pattern AT_SIGNS = Pattern.compile("[" + AT_SIGNS_CHARS + "]");

  public static final Pattern SCREEN_NAME_MATCH_END = Pattern.compile("^(?:[" + AT_SIGNS_CHARS + LATIN_ACCENTS_CHARS + "]|://)");

  public static final Pattern AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS = Pattern.compile("(^|[^&/" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC_CHARS + "])(#|\uFF03)(" + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*" + HASHTAG_ALPHA + HASHTAG_ALPHA_NUMERIC + "*)", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE | Pattern.UNICODE_CASE);
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_BEFORE = 1;
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_HASH = 2;
  public static final int AUTO_LINK_HASHTAGS_GROUP_TAG = 3;
  public static final Pattern HASHTAG_MATCH_END = Pattern.compile("^(?:[#ï¼ƒ]|://)");
