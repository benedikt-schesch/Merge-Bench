To resolve the merge conflict, let's analyze the given code snippet and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides.

The code snippet is written in Java and involves Spring framework configurations, specifically dealing with security and social configurations.

The conflict arises from the import statements where two different sets of imports are being merged. On one side (`HEAD`), there's an import for `org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.HttpSessionRequestCache;`. On the other side (`caaf8a909db2a1f688c3667dc5bdf0187d212bc2`), there are imports for `org.springframework.security.crypto.encrypt.Encryptors;` and `org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.RequestCache;`.

Let's examine the imports:
- `org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.HttpSessionRequestCache` is a specific implementation of `RequestCache` that stores the saved request in the HttpSession.
- `org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.RequestCache` is an interface that defines a strategy for caching the request. `HttpSessionRequestCache` is one of its implementations.
- `org.springframework.security.crypto.encrypt.Encryptors` is a utility class that provides methods for obtaining encryptors.

The change on the `HEAD` side is importing a specific implementation (`HttpSessionRequestCache`), while the change on the other side is importing an interface (`RequestCache`) related to the same functionality and another unrelated utility class (`Encryptors`) for encryption purposes.

Both sides seem to be adding different functionalities:
1. The `HEAD` side is specifically using or configuring `HttpSessionRequestCache`.
2. The other side is using or configuring `RequestCache` (potentially in a more generic way or with a different implementation) and `Encryptors` for encryption.

To resolve the conflict, we need to ensure that the necessary imports for both functionalities are included. Since `HttpSessionRequestCache` is an implementation of `RequestCache`, and they are related to the same general functionality (request caching), it's plausible that both are needed or that one is a replacement for the other depending on the context. The import of `Encryptors` seems unrelated to the request caching functionality.

Given the information and focusing on preserving the intent and semantics of both sides, the most straightforward resolution would be to include all the imports that are not redundant or conflicting.

Here's how we can resolve it:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ScopedProxyMode;
import org.springframework.core.env.Environment;
import org.springframework.security.core.Authentication;
import org.springframework.security.core.context.SecurityContextHolder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.encrypt.Encryptors;
import org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.HttpSessionRequestCache;
import org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.RequestCache;
import org.springframework.social.UserIdSource;
import org.springframework.social.config.annotation.ConnectionFactoryConfigurer;
import org.springframework.social.config.annotation.EnableSocial;
import org.springframework.social.config.annotation.SocialConfigurer;
import org.springframework.social.connect.Connection;
```
