To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first analyze the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The provided snippet is in Java, and it appears to be part of a larger class that handles some form of file or resource processing, given the presence of `paramFiles`, `BufferedReader`, and `JarFile`. The conflict is indicated by the Git merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`).

The conflict here is not about the code within the conflict markers (since there's no code between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`, and no code between `=======` and `>>>>>>>`), but rather about the empty lines or whitespace.

Let's examine the context and the intent:

1. Before the conflict markers, there's a method that returns a `BufferedReader` object. This method seems complete and is not directly related to the conflict.

2. The conflict markers surround empty lines. The version from `HEAD` (the current branch) and the version from the other commit (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) are essentially the same in terms of code presence - there's no code between the markers.

3. After the conflict markers, there's a method named `getVersionString()` that appears to be related to finding and possibly reading information from a JAR file containing the `Main` class.

The intent here seems to be about maintaining the structure and readability of the code. Both sides of the merge are essentially blank, indicating that the conflict might be due to formatting or whitespace differences.

However, without changing the context or modifying the spacing as per the instructions, and considering that there's no actual code conflict here but rather an empty conflict block, the resolution involves simply removing the conflict markers.

But, to adhere strictly to the instructions:

```java
                                paramFiles.size() > 0 ? paramFiles.toArray(type2) : null);
        return new BufferedReader(new StringReader(writer.toString()));
    }
}

	String findContainingJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(Main.class);
	  try { 
		  StringBuffer buffer = new  StringBuffer();
          JarFile jar = new JarFile(findContainingJar); 
```
