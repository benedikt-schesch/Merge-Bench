To resolve the given merge conflict, we need to analyze the code on both sides of the conflict and understand their intent.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a test class for handling HTTP responses and exceptions, specifically `GoogleJsonResponseException`. The conflict arises in a test method where an `HttpRequest` is executed, and the resulting `HttpResponse` is used to create a `GoogleJsonResponseException`.

Let's examine the conflicting code:

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "403\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
=======
    assertNull(ge.getDetails());
    assertTrue(ge.getMessage().startsWith("403"));
>>>>>>> 47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613
```

On the left side (`HEAD`), the code asserts that `responseException.getDetails()` is null and checks if `responseException.getMessage()` matches a specific expected message that includes the HTTP status code (403), the HTTP method (GET), and the URL.

On the right side (`47d00185e2cd4548663cc0e8c6cdf6d59640a613`), the code also asserts that `ge.getDetails()` is null (where `ge` presumably stands for a `GoogleJsonResponseException` object, similar to `responseException` on the left) and checks if `ge.getMessage()` starts with "403".

The main differences are:
1. The variable name used for `GoogleJsonResponseException` (`responseException` vs. `ge`).
2. The assertion on the exception message: the left side checks for an exact match with a constructed message, while the right side checks if the message starts with "403".

Given the context and the semantic intent, both sides seem to be testing the creation and properties of a `GoogleJsonResponseException`. However, there's an inconsistency in variable naming between the two versions (`responseException` vs. `ge`), and the message assertion is done differently.

To resolve this conflict, we should align the variable names and consider the intent behind the assertions.

First, let's address the variable name inconsistency. On the right side, `ge` is used, which is not defined in the given snippet but is presumably a `GoogleJsonResponseException`. For consistency with the left side, it should be `responseException`.

Second, regarding the assertions:
- Both sides check if `getDetails()` is null, so this part can be kept consistent.
- For the message assertion, the left side provides a more specific check (exact match), while the right side is more general (starts with "403"). The left side's check is more precise in terms of testing the exact content of the error message.

Here's the resolved code snippet, returned in markdown code syntax as requested, without modifying the surrounding context or spacing:

```java
        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "403\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertTrue(responseException.getMessage().startsWith("403"));
  }

  public void testFrom_detailsErrorObject() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport("{\"error\": {\"message\": \"invalid_token\"}, \"error_description\": \"Invalid value\"}", Json.MEDIA_TYPE);
    HttpRequest request =
