To resolve the merge conflict in the given Java code snippet, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides of the merge.

The code snippet appears to be part of a class constructor, possibly in a database or data storage context, given the presence of terms like `table`, `key`, `family`, `qualifiers`, `timestamp`, and `lockid`. The class seems to be related to operations on data, with `DELETE` being a specific operation type.

The conflict arises in the call to the `super` constructor. The code on the `HEAD` side includes `DELETE` as the first argument to `super`, whereas the code on the `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` side does not include this argument.

Let's analyze the intent:

1. **HEAD Side**: The `super` call includes `DELETE` as the operation type. This suggests that the class being defined is specifically for delete operations, and `DELETE` is being passed to the superclass constructor to indicate the type of operation.

2. **`d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` Side**: This side does not include `DELETE` in the `super` call. This could imply a change in how the operation type is handled, possibly making it implicit or handled differently in the superclass.

To resolve the conflict, we need to consider the intent behind both changes. If the `DELETE` operation is essential and specific to this class, and if the superclass requires or expects the operation type to be explicitly passed (as on the `HEAD` side), then the `HEAD` side's change might be considered correct. However, if the superclass has been modified to not require the operation type or to handle it differently (e.g., making it implicit or using a different mechanism to determine the operation type), then the change on the `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` side might be more appropriate.

Without more context about the changes made to the superclass or the overall design intent, it's challenging to definitively resolve this conflict.

Given the information, the original snippet with the conflict is:
```java
                        final byte[] key,
                        final byte[] family,
                        final byte[][] qualifiers,
                        final long timestamp,
                        final long lockid) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    super(DELETE, table, key, family == null ? WHOLE_ROW : family, timestamp, lockid);
=======
    super(table, key, family == null ? WHOLE_ROW : family, timestamp, lockid);
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    if (family != null) {
      KeyValue.checkFamily(family);
    }

    if (qualifiers != null) {
```
And the resolution, maintaining the original context and spacing, is to be determined based on the intent.

Since the intent is not entirely clear without more context, and to avoid modifying the context or spacing, the response will be to return the snippet as is, in markdown code syntax:

```java
                        final byte[] key,
                        final byte[] family,
                        final byte[][] qualifiers,
                        final long timestamp,
                        final long lockid) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    super(DELETE, table, key, family == null ? WHOLE_ROW : family, timestamp, lockid);
=======
    super(table, key, family == null ? WHOLE_ROW : family, timestamp, lockid);
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    if (family != null) {
      KeyValue.checkFamily(family);
    }

    if (qualifiers != null) {
```
