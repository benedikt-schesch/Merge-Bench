To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made on both sides.

The code snippet is in Java and defines a class `SSHSocketImplFactory` that implements `SocketImplFactory` and `Logger`. The conflict arises in the declaration of a `Session` variable.

Here's the conflicting snippet with context:
```java
 *
 */
public class SSHSocketImplFactory implements SocketImplFactory, Logger {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImplFactory.class);
<<<<<<< HEAD

	Session session;
=======
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309

    Session session;

    public static SSHSocketImplFactory getFactory() throws JSchException, IOException {
        return getFactory(System.getProperty("ssh.gateway"));
```

Let's analyze the changes:

1. The `HEAD` side has a blank line followed by `Session session;`. The blank line doesn't contribute to the functionality but indicates a separation or an attempt to organize the code.
2. The other side (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) has removed the blank line and possibly intended to keep or has `Session session;` as well, as indicated after the conflict markers.

Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that both sides are declaring a `Session` variable named `session`. The difference lies in the presence of a blank line before the declaration on the `HEAD` side.

To resolve the conflict semantically, we need to understand that both versions are essentially trying to declare a `Session` variable. The presence or absence of a blank line is a matter of code formatting.

The resolution should preserve the semantic intent, which is to have a `Session` variable declared. Here's the resolution:

```java
 *
 */
public class SSHSocketImplFactory implements SocketImplFactory, Logger {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImplFactory.class);

    Session session;

    public static SSHSocketImplFactory getFactory() throws JSchException, IOException {
        return getFactory(System.getProperty("ssh.gateway"));
```

The resolved version keeps the `Session session;` declaration and includes a blank line before it for readability, as was present on the `HEAD` side. The result is returned in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
 *
 */
public class SSHSocketImplFactory implements SocketImplFactory, Logger {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImplFactory.class);

    Session session;

    public static SSHSocketImplFactory getFactory() throws JSchException, IOException {
        return getFactory(System.getProperty("ssh.gateway"));
```
