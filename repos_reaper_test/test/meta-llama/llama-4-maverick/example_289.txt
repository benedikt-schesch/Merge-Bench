To resolve the given merge conflict, let's analyze the code and understand the intent behind the changes made on both sides.

The code snippet is in Java and appears to be part of a larger method or class, likely within a data processing or Hadoop-related context given the presence of `DataBag` and `keyWritable`. The snippet includes a conditional check for `bagType`, followed by a merge conflict marker section, and then a check for `isInputAttached()` with associated logic to create `DataBag` instances.

The conflict is between the local changes (`HEAD`) and the changes from the commit `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`. The conflicting section involves the introduction of variables `numInputs`, `readOnce` in the incoming changes.

Let's break down the sections:

1. **Before the Conflict**: The code checks if `bagType` is not null and equals "default" (case-insensitive), setting `useDefaultBag` to true if so. This logic seems to be related to determining how to handle or process a "bag" based on its type.

2. **The Conflict**: The incoming change (`>>>>>>> 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) introduces two new variables: `numInputs` and `readOnce`. `numInputs` is derived from `pkgr.getNumInputs(keyWritable.getIndex())`, suggesting it's related to the number of inputs for a particular key or index. `readOnce` is a boolean array initialized with `false` values, with the same length as `numInputs`. This change implies there's a need to track whether each input is read once.

3. **After the Conflict**: The code checks if an input is attached (`isInputAttached()`) and, if so, creates an array of `DataBag` instances with a length equal to `numInputs`.

To resolve the conflict, we need to understand the intent behind the introduction of `numInputs` and `readOnce`. The introduction of `numInputs` makes sense because it's used later to initialize `DataBag[] dbs`. However, `readOnce` is initialized but not used within the provided snippet. 

Without more context about how `readOnce` is intended to be used, we can still infer that `numInputs` is necessary for the subsequent logic. Thus, we should consider keeping `numInputs` as it is used. The variable `readOnce`, although not used in the given snippet, might be necessary for logic that follows or is part of a larger refactoring.

Given the available information, a semantically correct resolution could involve keeping both `numInputs` and `readOnce` as introduced by the incoming change, assuming `readOnce` is part of a larger logic or refactoring not shown in the snippet.

Here is the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original spacing and context:

```java
                if (bagType != null && bagType.equalsIgnoreCase("default")) {
                    useDefaultBag = true;
                }
            }
        }
        int numInputs = pkgr.getNumInputs(keyWritable.getIndex());
        boolean[] readOnce = new boolean[numInputs];
        for (int i = 0; i < numInputs; i++)
            readOnce[i] = false;

        if (isInputAttached()) {
            // Create numInputs bags
            DataBag[] dbs = null;
            dbs = new DataBag[numInputs];
```
