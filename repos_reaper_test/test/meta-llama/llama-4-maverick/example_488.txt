To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes introduced by both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class used in a graphical or game development context, likely using the AndEngine library given the presence of classes like `TextureRegion`, `Scene`, and `BitmapTextureAtlas`.

The conflict arises on the declaration of a variable `mOnScreenControlTexture`. The two versions are:

1. `private BitmapTexture mOnScreenControlTexture;` (from `HEAD`, i.e., the local branch)
2. `private BitmapTextureAtlas mOnScreenControlTexture;` (from `91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d`, i.e., the branch being merged)

Let's analyze the intent and semantics:

- `BitmapTexture` is a class that represents a texture loaded from a bitmap. It's used for rendering images.
- `BitmapTextureAtlas` is a class that represents a texture atlas, which is a large texture that contains many smaller textures. It's used for efficient rendering by reducing the number of texture switches.

The variable in question, `mOnScreenControlTexture`, is related to "on-screen controls," which typically refer to graphical elements like joysticks or buttons that are displayed on the screen for user interaction.

The change from `BitmapTexture` to `BitmapTextureAtlas` suggests a shift from using a simple texture to using a texture atlas for on-screen controls. This could be for optimization purposes, as using a texture atlas can improve performance by reducing the number of OpenGL texture binds.

To resolve the conflict, we need to determine which representation is more appropriate or if there's a way to reconcile both intents. 

However, without more context about why one side is using `BitmapTexture` and the other `BitmapTextureAtlas`, and considering that `BitmapTextureAtlas` is generally used for more complex or optimized scenarios (since it can contain multiple textures), the most straightforward resolution would lean towards using `BitmapTextureAtlas` if the application is complex enough to benefit from it, or if the other parts of the code (not shown) are adapted to work with a texture atlas.

But, given the information and sticking strictly to the task:

```java
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private Scene mScene;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mOnScreenControlTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mOnScreenControlTexture;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mOnScreenControlBaseTextureRegion;
	private TextureRegion mOnScreenControlKnobTextureRegion;

	private boolean mPlaceOnScreenControlsAtDifferentVerticalLocations = false;
```
