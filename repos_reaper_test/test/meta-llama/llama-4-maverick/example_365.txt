To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the intent of both sides of the merge.

The code snippet is written in Java and appears to be part of a class that overrides methods related to building HTTP requests. Specifically, it's dealing with a `buildGetRequest` method that returns a `LowLevelHttpRequest` object.

The conflict arises in the `buildGetRequest` method where two different versions of the code are being merged:

1. The version from `HEAD` (the local branch being merged into) simply returns a new `MockLowLevelHttpRequest()` without passing any arguments.
2. The version from `f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b` (the branch being merged) returns a new `MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url)` with the `url` parameter passed to it.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes.

- The `HEAD` version suggests that the `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` class can be instantiated without needing a URL, possibly setting a default or not requiring it.
- The version from the other branch indicates that the URL is being passed to `MockLowLevelHttpRequest`, suggesting that the class now requires or can utilize the URL for its initialization.

Given the information and looking at the method signature `buildGetRequest(String url)`, it's reasonable to infer that the URL is relevant for building a GET request. Thus, passing the URL to `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` seems more appropriate as it likely configures the request with the intended URL.

However, without knowing the specifics of the `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` class (e.g., how it handles being instantiated with or without a URL), we can't be certain which approach is correct.

Since the change that includes passing the `url` to `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` seems more aligned with the method's purpose (building a GET request for a given URL), a reasonable resolution could be to choose that version.

Here's the resolved snippet in markdown code syntax, preserving the original context and spacing:

```java
>>>>>>> f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildGetRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildHeadRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    if (!supportsHead()) {
```
