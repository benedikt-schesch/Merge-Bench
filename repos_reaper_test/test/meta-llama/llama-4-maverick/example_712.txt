To resolve the given merge conflict, let's first understand the context and the changes made in both branches.

The code snippet appears to be part of a larger method that handles authentication or configuration testing for a music-related application. The snippet is written in Java and involves various managers (`AuthenticatorManager`, `CollectionManager`, `InfoSystem`) that perform different tasks such as setting user data, fetching playlists or starred items, resolving user information, and broadcasting configuration test results.

The conflict arises from the fact that two different branches have modified the same section of the code in different ways.

1. The `HEAD` branch (typically the current branch being worked on) has explicitly called several methods on `CollectionManager.getInstance()` to fetch different types of data (`fetchPlaylists()`, `fetchLovedItemsPlaylist()`, `fetchStarredArtists()`, `fetchStarredAlbums()`) and also called `InfoSystem.getInstance().resolve(getLoggedInUser())`. This suggests that the `HEAD` branch is trying to ensure that various collections and user information are fetched or resolved after a certain condition is met (likely after a successful authentication or configuration).

2. The branch being merged into `HEAD` (identified by the commit hash `760cca9f756c8b759aadcc9e3b67508946d2b173`) has introduced a new method call `CollectionManager.getInstance().fetchAll()` instead of the multiple `fetch*()` calls seen in the `HEAD` branch. This implies that the other branch is simplifying the code by introducing a `fetchAll()` method that presumably fetches all necessary collections or data in one go, making the individual fetch calls redundant.

To resolve this conflict, we need to understand the intent behind both changes. The `HEAD` branch is explicitly fetching various types of data, suggesting a need for granular control or specific handling for different types of data. On the other hand, the other branch simplifies this by introducing a `fetchAll()` method, which could be more efficient or easier to maintain.

Since `fetchAll()` implies fetching all necessary data, which could include the specific data types fetched in the `HEAD` branch (playlists, loved items playlist, starred artists, starred albums), and assuming `fetchAll()` also implicitly covers or replaces the need for `InfoSystem.getInstance().resolve(getLoggedInUser())` or that it's not directly related, the most straightforward resolution would be to use `fetchAll()` if it's designed to handle all necessary fetches.

However, without knowing the exact implementation of `fetchAll()` or its relation to `InfoSystem.getInstance().resolve(getLoggedInUser())`, we must be cautious. If `fetchAll()` does indeed cover all the necessary fetches and it's confirmed that `InfoSystem.getInstance().resolve(getLoggedInUser())` is either not needed or is handled elsewhere, then we can simplify the code by using `fetchAll()`.

Let's examine the resolution:

```java
                am.setUserData(account, MANDELLA_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATIONTIME_HATCHET,
                        String.valueOf(accessTokenExpiresIn));
                ensureAccessTokens();
            }
        }
        CollectionManager.getInstance().fetchAll();
        InfoSystem.getInstance().resolve(getLoggedInUser());
        AuthenticatorManager.broadcastConfigTestResult(getId(),
                AuthenticatorManager.CONFIG_TEST_RESULT_PLUGINTYPE_AUTHUTILS,
                AuthenticatorManager.CONFIG_TEST_RESULT_TYPE_SUCCESS);
    }
```

This resolution assumes that both `fetchAll()` and `InfoSystem.getInstance().resolve(getLoggedInUser())` are necessary and that they serve distinct purposes. However, without further context on `fetchAll()`, we are making an educated guess.

Given the information and the steps considered, here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax as requested:

```java
                am.setUserData(account, MANDELLA_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATIONTIME_HATCHET,
                        String.valueOf(accessTokenExpiresIn));
                ensureAccessTokens();
            }
        }
        CollectionManager.getInstance().fetchAll();
        InfoSystem.getInstance().resolve(getLoggedInUser());
        AuthenticatorManager.broadcastConfigTestResult(getId(),
                AuthenticatorManager.CONFIG_TEST_RESULT_PLUGINTYPE_AUTHUTILS,
                AuthenticatorManager.CONFIG_TEST_RESULT_TYPE_SUCCESS);
    }
```
