Looking at the merge conflict, one side initializes `GruntParser` with just a `StringReader` for the script, while the other side also passes in `myPig` as a second parameter. The change seems to be adding the `myPig` parameter to the constructor.

Based on the surrounding code, `myPig` is defined and available in the context. The code after the conflict references `myPig.getPigContext()`, showing that `myPig` is a required variable. Therefore, providing `myPig` to the constructor is likely the correct approach.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "illustrate b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            myPig.getPigContext().getProperties().setProperty("pig.usenewlogicalplan", "true");
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
