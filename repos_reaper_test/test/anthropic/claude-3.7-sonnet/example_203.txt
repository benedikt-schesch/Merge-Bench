Looking at this merge conflict, I see that one side has updated the method signature to return an `ExecJob` type and adjusted the implementation to return the result of the nested `store` call, while the original version does not return anything (void).

Here's the resolved code:

```java
     * @param id The alias to store
     * @param filename The file to which to store to
     * @throws IOException
     */

    public ExecJob store(String id, String filename) throws IOException {
        return store(id, filename, PigStorage.class.getName() + "()");   // SFPig is the default store function
    }
        
    /**
     *  forces execution of query (and all queries from which it reads), in order to store result in file
     */
```

I chose the implementation from the incoming change (the bottom one) because it provides more functionality by returning an `ExecJob` object which likely allows the caller to track or interact with the execution. This appears to be an API improvement that maintains backward compatibility since callers can still ignore the return value if they don't need it.
