Looking at this merge conflict, I notice it's very straightforward. One side (HEAD) has an empty line after the end of the first license block, while the other side (1488b22) doesn't have this empty line. Since this is just whitespace difference between license blocks, I'll resolve it by keeping the version without the extra line since it makes the spacing between license blocks consistent.
