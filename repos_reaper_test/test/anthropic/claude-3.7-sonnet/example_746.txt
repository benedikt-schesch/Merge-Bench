Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are setting up the same animation with the same parameters. The only difference is in the formatting: one side has the code on a single line, while the other splits it across two lines.

Here's the resolved snippet with the conflict fixed:

```java
        setTranslationX(finalX);
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideClose() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
        animate().translationX(-params.leftMargin).setDuration(SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
