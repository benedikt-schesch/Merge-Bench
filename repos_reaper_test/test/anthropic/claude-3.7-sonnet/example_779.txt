Looking at the merge conflict, I need to carefully analyze the intent of both sides. The HEAD version appears to add a parameter to the method `retryGetRootRegionLater` to accept a callback, which would likely be used in the method's implementation. The other version has no parameters.

Given the method's implementation shown, there's no direct use of the `cb` parameter visible in the snippet, making it difficult to determine if it's needed in the implementation. Without seeing how this parameter is used later in the method, I'll preserve the conflict as I can't be certain which version is correct.

```java
        zk = null;
      }
    }

    /** Schedule a timer to retry {@link #getRootRegion} after some time.  */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    private void retryGetRootRegionLater(final AsyncCallback.DataCallback cb) {
=======
    private void retryGetRootRegionLater() {
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
      newTimeout(new TimerTask() {
          public void run(final Timeout timeout) {
            if (!getRootRegion()) {  // Try to read the znodes
              connectZK();  // unless we need to connect first.
            }

```
