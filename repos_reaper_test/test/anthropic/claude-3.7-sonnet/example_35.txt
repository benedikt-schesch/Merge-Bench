Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to implement the same method `getVersion()` with the same core logic. The conflict is in two areas:

1. The catch block formatting (empty `{}` vs empty body on separate lines)
2. The default version string ("1.4" vs "1.2")

Since this is a conflict about version numbers, I'll resolve it by taking the version from the HEAD branch (newer version "1.4") while using the more compact catch block style from the other branch.

```java
    @Override
    public String getVersion() {
        String version = null;
        try {
            version = ServerInfo.class.getPackage().getImplementationVersion();
        } catch (Exception e) {}
        return version != null ? version : "1.4";
    }

    @Override
    public String getStartupTime() {
        return startupTime;

```
