I'll analyze this merge conflict, focusing on the semantic intent of both sides.

Looking at the conflict, I see:
1. On HEAD: `@Facebook("likes")` with field name `likesCount`
2. On the other branch: `@Facebook` without parameter and field name `likes`

Since the getter annotation and JavaDoc clearly indicate this is for "the number of likes", both branches are targeting the same functionality. The difference is in the naming and annotation parameter.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
   * @return The number of likes the page has
   * @since 1.6.5
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  @Facebook("likes")
  private Long likesCount;

  /**
   * The Pages that this Page Likes.
   *
   * @RestFB.GraphApi.Since 2.6

```

I chose the HEAD version because:
1. It includes the explicit parameter in the `@Facebook` annotation, which likely maps to the API field name
2. The field name `likesCount` is more descriptive than just `likes`, making it clearer that this represents a count
