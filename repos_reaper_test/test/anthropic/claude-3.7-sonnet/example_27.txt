Looking at this merge conflict, one side (HEAD) is importing `org.spout.math.GenericMath`, while the other side (cc0703054530b4eeda07a2b1b619ed34e1e7d201) has removed this import or never added it.

Since I don't have information about whether this `GenericMath` class is used elsewhere in the file, I'll preserve the import as it's generally safer to keep imports that might be needed rather than removing them.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
import org.spout.api.material.range.EffectRange;
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.resource.SpoutModels;
import org.spout.api.util.bytebit.ByteBitSet;
import org.spout.api.util.flag.Flag;
import org.spout.math.GenericMath;

import org.spout.physics.ReactDefaults;
import org.spout.physics.collision.shape.CollisionShape;

/**
 * Defines the specific characteristics of a Block
```
