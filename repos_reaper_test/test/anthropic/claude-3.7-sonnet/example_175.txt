Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same change, but the indentation is different. The HEAD side has no indentation, while the `1488b22c` commit has proper indentation with 4 spaces for the code within the try block.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
        parser.parseContOnError();
    }

    public void exec() throws Throwable {
        try {
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Exception pe = Utils.getPermissionException(e);
            if (pe != null)
                log.error("You don't have permission to perform the operation. Error from the server: " + pe.getMessage());

```
