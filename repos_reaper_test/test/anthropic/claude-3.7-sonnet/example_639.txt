Looking at this merge conflict, one branch includes a `serialVersionUID` field, and the other branch omits it. Since adding a serialVersionUID is a common best practice for serializable classes (which AbstractFacebookType likely extends), and removing it could potentially cause serialization compatibility issues, I'll preserve the field.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class Thumbnail extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * The name of the thumbnail
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter

```
