Looking at the merge conflict, both sides are initializing a Set of strings with the same values, but with different syntax:
1. The HEAD version uses the older way of creating a TreeSet with generics and wrapping the strings in an array.
2. The incoming change (5adedd2) uses the newer Java syntax with diamond operator `<>` and directly passes the strings to `Arrays.asList()`.

Since both sides have the same intent and the newer syntax is cleaner, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```java
  private final static int JUDGE_TIMEOUT_PER_CARD = 7 * 1000;
  private final static int MAX_SKIPS_BEFORE_KICK = 2;
  private final static Set<String> FINITE_PLAYTIMES;

  static {
    final Set<String> finitePlaytimes = new TreeSet<>(Arrays.asList("0.25x", "0.5x", "0.75x", "1x", "1.25x", "1.5x", "1.75x", "2x", "2.5x", "3x", "4x", "5x", "10x"));
    FINITE_PLAYTIMES = Collections.unmodifiableSet(finitePlaytimes);
  }

  private final int id;
  /**
