Looking at this merge conflict, I need to resolve it carefully by understanding the intent of both changes.

The HEAD version uses a local variable `MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer` assigned from a collection (`mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery)`) before checking if it's not null.

The incoming change (ab8ddfc) assumes `sMediaPlayer` is already available as a field and adds curly braces to the if statement.

Since the HEAD version defines where `sMediaPlayer` comes from, while the other version only adds braces, I'll resolve by keeping the variable assignment and adding the braces for consistent style.

```java
        }
    }

    @Override
    public long getPosition() {
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            return sMediaPlayer.getCurrentPosition();
        }
        return 0;
    }

```
