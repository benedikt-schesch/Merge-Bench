Looking at the merge conflict, I can see it's about importing `android.content.SharedPreferences` which is present in HEAD but removed in the other branch.

Since I can see that `PreferenceManager` is imported at the bottom of the snippet (which is typically used with SharedPreferences), it seems likely that the SharedPreferences import is needed. However, without seeing how these imports are actually used in the code, I'll resolve by keeping the import.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
import android.app.FragmentManager;
import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.IntentFilter;
import android.content.SharedPreferences;
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.graphics.drawable.Drawable;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.os.Handler;
import android.preference.PreferenceManager;
```
