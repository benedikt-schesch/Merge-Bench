Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to start the camera when the activity resumes, but the right side includes a null check before doing so. The safer approach is to include the null check to prevent potential NullPointerException.

Here's the resolved code with the conflict fixed:

```java
  }

  @Override protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();

    if (qrCodeReaderView != null) {
      qrCodeReaderView.startCamera();
    }
  }

  @Override protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();

```
