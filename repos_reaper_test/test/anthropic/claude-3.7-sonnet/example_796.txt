Looking at this merge conflict, I can see there's a difference in the `deserializeObject` method call. One version includes `rpcid` as a parameter, while the other doesn't. To resolve this properly, I'll need to understand which approach is correct semantically.

Since I don't have enough context to determine which implementation is correct (whether `deserializeObject` should take the `rpcid` parameter or not), I'll provide the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
    if ((flags & HBaseRpc.RPC_ERROR) != 0) {
      return deserializeException(buf, rpc);
    }
    try {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      return deserializeObject(buf, rpcid, rpc);
=======
      return deserializeObject(buf, rpc);
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {  // The RPC didn't look good to us.
      return new InvalidResponseException(e.getMessage(), e);
    }
  }

```
