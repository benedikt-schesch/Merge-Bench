Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine the intent of both sides.

The first branch (HEAD) is explicitly listing several fetch operations:
- `fetchPlaylists()`
- `fetchLovedItemsPlaylist()`
- `fetchStarredAlbums()`
- `fetchStarredArtists()`

The second branch is introducing a single method called `fetchAll()` which likely consolidates these operations.

Given the naming, it appears the intent of the second branch was to refactor the individual fetch operations into a single method. The most appropriate resolution would be to keep the new consolidated method:

```java
        addCollection(new UserCollection());
        addCollection(new HatchetCollection());

        ensureLovedItemsPlaylist();
        updatePlaylists();
        fetchAll();

        TomahawkApp.getContext().registerReceiver(mCollectionManagerReceiver,
                new IntentFilter(InfoSystem.INFOSYSTEM_RESULTSREPORTED));
        TomahawkApp.getContext().registerReceiver(mCollectionManagerReceiver,
                new IntentFilter(InfoSystem.INFOSYSTEM_OPLOGISEMPTIED));
```
