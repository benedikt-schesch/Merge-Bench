Looking at the merge conflict, I need to consider the intent of both sides:

1. The HEAD version has updated the method signature to include a `Sort` parameter.
2. The incoming version (fe1b8ab) has marked the method as obsolete with a thrown exception and a comment indicating it should be removed.

Since the incoming change is explicitly marking this method as obsolete and instructing to remove calls to it, I'll resolve the conflict with that intention.

```java
	 *            Offset (0 for none)
	 * @param limit
	 *            Limit (0 for none)
	 * @return
	 */
	public ArrayList<FileLocation> getDirectory(INotifiableManager manager, String path, DirectoryMask mask, int offset, int limit,  final int mMediaType, Sort sort) {
		throw new RuntimeException("Obsolete, remove any calls from this.");
		/*
		final ArrayList<FileLocation> dirs = new ArrayList<FileLocation>();
		final JsonNode jsonDirs = mConnection.getJson(
				manager,
				"Files.GetDirectory",
				sort(obj().p("media", "files").p("directory", path),

```
