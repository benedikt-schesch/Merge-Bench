Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) doesn't have a return value documentation for the `fileSize` method, while the other side (1488b22) adds that documentation. Since adding more complete documentation is almost always beneficial and doesn't change functionality, I'll resolve by including the added return documentation.

```java
    }

    /**
     * Returns the length of a file in bytes which exists in the HDFS (accounts for replication).
     * @param filename
     * @return length of the file in bytes
     * @throws IOException
     */
    public long fileSize(String filename) throws IOException {
        DataStorage dfs = pigContext.getDfs();
        ElementDescriptor elem = dfs.asElement(filename);

```
