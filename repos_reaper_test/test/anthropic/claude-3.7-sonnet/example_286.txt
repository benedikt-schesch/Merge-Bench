Looking at the merge conflict, it appears that two different changes were made to the code. One side added a `readOnce` boolean array, while the other side added a `keyWritable` field of type `PigNullableWritable`. These seem to serve different purposes and both might be needed for the class to function correctly. Since these are two separate, non-conflicting declarations, I'll include both in the resolution.

```java

    private boolean useDefaultBag = false;

    protected Packager pkgr;

    private boolean[] readOnce;
    
    private PigNullableWritable keyWritable;

    public POPackage(OperatorKey k) {
        this(k, -1, null);
    }


```
