Looking at this merge conflict, the difference is purely in the code style for the `else if` statement. One side has the opening braces on a new line, and the other has them on the same line as the condition. I'll resolve it by preserving the intent of both sides, which is simply to check if the action equals `readDescriptorActionName`.

```java
        public void run() {
          writeQAction(args, callbackContext);
        }
      });
      return true;
    } else if (readDescriptorActionName.equals(action)) {
      cordova.getThreadPool().execute(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
          readDescriptorAction(args, callbackContext);
        }
      });
```
