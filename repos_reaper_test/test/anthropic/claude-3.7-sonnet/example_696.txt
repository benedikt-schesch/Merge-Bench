Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that there's a new method `launchBrowser` being added from the branch `c08e0d7adee3a6c42dfe2887fad422ea332c015e`, while the HEAD doesn't have this method. Since this appears to be a simple addition of a new utility method that doesn't conflict with any existing code, the resolution is to accept the incoming change.

```java
    		Log.e(TAG, e.getMessage());
    		return null;
    	}
    }
    
    static void launchBrowser(CharSequence url, Activity act) {
		Intent browser = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url.toString()));
		browser.putExtra(Browser.EXTRA_APPLICATION_ID, act.getPackageName());
		act.startActivity(browser);
    }
