Here's the resolved merge conflict:

```java
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      playerNames.add(player.getUser().getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.PLAYERS, playerNames);

    final User[] spectatorsCopy = spectators.toArray(new User[0]);
    final List<String> spectatorNames = new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length);
    for (final User spectator : spectatorsCopy) {
      spectatorNames.add(spectator.getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.SPECTATORS, spectatorNames);

```

I chose the newer version because:
1. Using `new User[0]` instead of `new User[spectators.size()]` is a more modern and efficient idiom in Java
2. Using the diamond operator `<>` instead of explicitly repeating the generic type `<String>` is cleaner and aligned with modern Java practices

Both changes are stylistic improvements while maintaining the same functionality.
