Looking at the merge conflict, I need to determine the right resolution by examining the semantic intent of both sides.

The conflict involves the initialization of a `GruntParser` object:
1. HEAD uses a constructor with only a `StringReader` parameter
2. The other commit adds a second `myPig` parameter

Examining the context, I notice that this is part of a test method. Since there's no additional context about what `myPig` is or whether it's needed, and both sides are trying to create a GruntParser with at least a StringReader, I'll resolve in favor of the more complete constructor that includes both parameters.

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "explain b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```
