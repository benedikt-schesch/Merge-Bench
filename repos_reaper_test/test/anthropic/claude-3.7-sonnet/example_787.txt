Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the difference is in the constructor of the parent class. The HEAD version is calling `super` with a parameter named `PUT` as the first parameter, while the other version doesn't include this parameter.

To resolve this semantically, I need to understand which version aligns with the proper intent. Since this is a `PutRequest` class, and there's a constant named `PUT` being passed in the HEAD version, it's likely that this parameter is a request type or operation code that was added to the parent constructor. The parent class was probably updated to accept this parameter to distinguish between different types of requests.

Here's the resolved code:

```java

  /** Private constructor.  */
  private PutRequest(final byte[] table,
                     final KeyValue kv,
                     final long lockid) {
    super(PUT, table, kv.key(), kv.family(), kv.timestamp(), lockid);
    this.qualifiers = new byte[][] { kv.qualifier() };
    this.values = new byte[][] { kv.value() };
  }

  /** Private constructor.  */

```

I've chosen the HEAD version as it appears to be an enhancement that adds a request type parameter, which is likely needed for the proper functioning of the parent class constructor.
