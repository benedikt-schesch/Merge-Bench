I'll resolve the merge conflict for this Java code snippet. The conflict is simply about different code styles for the same logical operation: whether to use braces for a single-statement if block.

```java
        mTotalHeight = WIDGETS_MARGIN;

        for (int i = 0; i < mOpenWidgets.size(); i++) {
            WidgetBase.WidgetContainer widget = mOpenWidgets.get(i);

            if (widget != ignore) {
                widget.setYSmooth(mTotalHeight);
            }

            mTotalHeight += widget.getMeasuredHeight() + mSpacing;
        }
    }

```

I chose the version with braces as it follows more maintainable coding practices and is generally considered safer to prevent future bugs when the if-statement might be expanded.
