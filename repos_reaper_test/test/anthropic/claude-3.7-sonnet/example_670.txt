Looking at the merge conflict, it seems one side has set the implementation version to "3.1.12-SNAPSHOT" (which typically indicates a development version), while the other side has set it to "3.1.12" (which typically indicates a release version). Based on the commit hash in the conflict marker, it appears that the release version "3.1.12" is being merged in from a specific commit.

The most likely scenario is that the SNAPSHOT version was in the development branch, and now a release is being finalized by changing to the non-SNAPSHOT version. I'll resolve this by choosing the release version.

```java
        return "speedment";
    }

    @Override
    public String getImplementationVersion() {
        return "3.1.12";
    }

    @Override
    public String getVendor() {
        return "Speedment, Inc.";
```
