Looking at this merge conflict, it seems that both sides are trying to define the `jsonMappingCompleted` method but with different method signatures:

- The HEAD version includes a `JsonMapper jsonMapper` parameter
- The incoming change (a17acec0) has no parameters

Since the function's implementation doesn't appear to use the `jsonMapper` parameter in the visible code segment (as it only deals with `picture` and `rawPicture`), I'll resolve this by going with the simpler signature (no parameters) from the incoming change:

```java
    Date dateStart = toDateFromLongFormat(rawStartTime);
    startTime = dateStart == null ? toDateFromShortFormat(rawStartTime) : dateStart;
  }

  @JsonMappingCompleted
  protected void jsonMappingCompleted() {
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

```
