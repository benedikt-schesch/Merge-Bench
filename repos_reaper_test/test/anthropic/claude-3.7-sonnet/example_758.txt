Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class ExitHookTest {

    private static final int KEY = 1;
    private static final int JVM_STARTUP_WAIT_TIME_MS = 5_000;
    private static final String PRE_SHUTDOWN_ACTION_EXECUTED = "PRE_SHUTDOWN_ACTION_EXECUTED";
    private static final String USER_SHUTDOWN_HOOK_EXECUTED = "USER_SHUTDOWN_HOOK_EXECUTED";

    @Rule
    public TemporaryFolder folder = new TemporaryFolder();
```

I chose the HEAD version with 5,000 ms wait time instead of 2,000 ms. This is likely a timeout value, and the HEAD version increases it, which is typically done to make tests more reliable by allowing more time for startup operations.
