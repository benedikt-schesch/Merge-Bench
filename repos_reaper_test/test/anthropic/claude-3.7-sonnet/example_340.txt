Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the two sides have different implementations of the `animRotate` method:

1. HEAD version simply calls `setRefreshAnimation(true)`
2. The other version includes a commented explanation saying that rotating buttons cause performance issues, and contains conditional code that's effectively disabled with `if (false && null != v)`

Since the method is already deprecated (as shown in the Javadoc) and points users to `WithHeaderActivity#setRefreshAnimation(boolean)`, and the HEAD version directly calls this recommended method, I'll resolve in favor of the HEAD version while preserving the performance insight from the other version.

```java
	/**
	 * @param v
	 * @deprecated use {@link WithHeaderActivity#setRefreshAnimation(boolean)}
	 */
	protected void animRotate(View v) {
	    // TODO: 经过几天的测试发现, 旋转按钮才是真正的性能瓶颈, 它增加了N倍的GC压力, 使得所有其他操作都变得缓慢.
	    setRefreshAnimation(true);
	}
	
    /**
     * Start/Stop Top Refresh Button's Animation
     * 
```
