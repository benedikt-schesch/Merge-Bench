Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

import com.restfb.exception.FacebookGraphException;
import com.restfb.exception.generator.DefaultFacebookExceptionGenerator;
import com.restfb.testutils.AssertJson;

import org.json.JSONException;
import org.junit.Test;

public class StatusExceptionTest extends AbstractJsonMapperTests {

  @Test

```

I've resolved the conflict by including the additional import for `org.json.JSONException` that was added in the other branch. This appears to be a straightforward addition of an import statement that will likely be needed for JSON-related exception handling in the test class.
