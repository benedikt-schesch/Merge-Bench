Looking at this merge conflict, I see that the difference is in how `MAPREDUCE` is being specified:
- The HEAD version uses a constant `MAPREDUCE`
- The incoming change version uses `ExecType.MAPREDUCE` (fully qualified enum)

Since `MAPREDUCE` is likely a constant that refers to the same `ExecType.MAPREDUCE`, the intent is the same on both sides. The fully qualified version is more explicit and likely safer, so I'll resolve in favor of that approach.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
    private PigServer pig;
    
    @Before
    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
        pig = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
    }

    @Test
    public void testBigGroupAll() throws Throwable {

```
