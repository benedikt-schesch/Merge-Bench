Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine the semantic intent of both sides. One side defines `ABActivityViewer` as a simple interface, while the other makes it extend `TaskController`. Since the extension adds functionality and there's no indication of why it shouldn't extend `TaskController`, it makes sense to keep that change.

```java
 * Date: 7/17/14.
 * <p/>
 * MVP的View层，UI相关，Activity需要实现该interface
 * 它会包含一个Presenter的引用，当有事件发生（比如按钮点击后），会调用Presenter层的方法
 */
public interface ABActivityViewer extends TaskController{

    /**
     * 显示Toast信息
     *
     * @param message
```
