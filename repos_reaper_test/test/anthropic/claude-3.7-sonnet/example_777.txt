Looking at this merge conflict, I see that a new method `isGetRequest()` is being added. This method appears to be implementing new functionality that checks a specific condition based on the `versions` and `EXIST_FLAG` variables. Since the conflict is simply an addition of a new method on the incoming side with no conflicting changes from the HEAD side, I'll resolve by accepting the new method.

```java
    final GetRequest rpc = new GetRequest(0F, table, key);
    rpc.family(family);
    return rpc;
  }

  /** Returns true if this is actually an "Get" RPC. */
  private boolean isGetRequest() {
    return (versions & EXIST_FLAG) == 0;
  }

  /**
   * Specifies a particular column family to get.
   * @param family The column family.
   * <strong>This byte array will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @return {@code this}, always.
```
