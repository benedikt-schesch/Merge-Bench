Looking at the merge conflict, it appears the difference is the import of JUnit classes. The HEAD version includes the import for `org.junit.*` while the 06e8633 commit removes this import.

To resolve this, I need to determine if the JUnit import is required for this test class. Since this is a test class for `AbstractAssert#as(Description)` and is named with "Tests" in the filename, it's likely that JUnit is needed. However, without seeing the actual test methods, I can't be 100% certain.

Given the limited context and considering this is a test class (as indicated by the Javadoc), keeping the JUnit import seems appropriate:

```java
import org.fest.assertions.api.AbstractAssert;
import org.fest.assertions.api.ConcreteAssert;
import org.fest.assertions.description.Description;
import org.fest.test.ExpectedException;
import org.junit.*;

/**
