Looking at this merge conflict, there's a simple difference in formatting for the method `isNotEqualTo`. One version has a space before the opening curly brace, and the other doesn't. This is purely a stylistic difference, and in terms of semantics, they both express the same intent.

I'll resolve this by choosing the style with the space before the curly brace, which is consistent with the incoming change from 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7.

```java
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```
