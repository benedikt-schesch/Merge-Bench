Here is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
      return new InvalidResponseException(e.getMessage(), e);
    }
  }

  /**
   * De-serializes an exception from HBase 0.94 and before.
   * @param buf The buffer to read from.
   * @param request The RPC that caused this exception.
   */
  static HBaseException deserializeException(final ChannelBuffer buf,
                                             final HBaseRpc request) {

```

The conflict involves a method comment, and the newer commit (d543609) provides a more specific description that clarifies this method is for deserializing exceptions specifically from HBase 0.94 and before. This is more informative and precise than the original comment, so I've chosen the newer version.
