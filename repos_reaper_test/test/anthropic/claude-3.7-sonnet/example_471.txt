Looking at this merge conflict, it seems that on the HEAD side there's an addition of two methods for setting username and password, while the other side (a77e57e...) doesn't have these methods. Since the addition of authentication methods could be an important security feature, I'll preserve these methods in the resolution.

```java
        void setProcessExpiresFrequency( int processExpiresFrequency );
        void setMemcachedNodes( @Nonnull String memcachedNodes );
        void setFailoverNodes( String failoverNodes );
        void setLockingMode( @Nullable final String lockingMode );
        void setLockingMode( @Nullable final LockingMode lockingMode, @Nullable final Pattern uriPattern, final boolean storeSecondaryBackup );
        void setUsername(String username);
        void setPassword(String password);

        /**
         * Creates a new instance of {@link MemcachedBackupSession} (needed so that it's possible to
         * create specialized {@link MemcachedBackupSession} instances).
         */
```
