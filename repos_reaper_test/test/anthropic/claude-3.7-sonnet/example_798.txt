Looking at this merge conflict, it appears that the incoming change (d54360...) is adding a documentation comment for the `GetProtocolVersionRequest` class, explaining its purpose. The HEAD version doesn't have this comment. Since this is just adding documentation without changing any functionality, I'll resolve by keeping the comment from the incoming change.

```java
    'g', 'e', 't',
    'P', 'r', 'o', 't', 'o', 'c', 'o', 'l',
    'V', 'e', 'r', 's', 'i', 'o', 'n'
  };

  /**
   * RPC used to discover the exact protocol version spoken by the server.
   * Not exposed as part of the public API, and only used when talking to
   * HBase 0.94.x and earlier.
   */
  private final static class GetProtocolVersionRequest extends HBaseRpc {

    @Override
    byte[] method(final byte unused_server_version) {
      return GET_PROTOCOL_VERSION;
```
