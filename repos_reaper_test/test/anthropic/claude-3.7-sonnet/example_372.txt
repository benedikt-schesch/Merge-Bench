Looking at this merge conflict, I see that the HEAD version includes the `@Beta` annotation, while the incoming change from commit `51762f221ec8ab38da03149c8012e63aec0433dc` removes it.

When resolving this conflict, I need to consider the intent of both changes. The method itself appears to be a simple boolean method that indicates if the transport is mTLS. The conflict only involves the `@Beta` annotation, which typically indicates that an API is still experimental and subject to change.

Since removing the `@Beta` annotation would suggest the API is now considered stable, I'll resolve this conflict by keeping the HEAD version with the annotation, as it's generally safer to mark an API as experimental than to prematurely mark it as stable.

```java
  /**
   * Returns whether the transport is mTLS.
   *
   * @return boolean indicating if the transport is mTLS.
   */
  @Beta
  public boolean isMtls() {
    return false;
  }

  /**
```
