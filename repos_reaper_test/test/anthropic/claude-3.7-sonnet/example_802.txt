Looking at this merge conflict, one side is creating a new `MultiAction` with a parameter (`server_version`) and the other is creating it without parameters. The context suggests this is part of a batching operation in a Java class.

Given the available context, it seems the newer implementation (HEAD) is passing additional information (`server_version`) to the `MultiAction` constructor. This likely represents an intentional change to make the `MultiAction` constructor accept a server version parameter, which appears to be an enhancement.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
    MultiAction batch;
    boolean schedule_flush = false;

    synchronized (this) {
      if (batched_rpcs == null) {
        batched_rpcs = new MultiAction(server_version);
        addMultiActionCallbacks(batched_rpcs);
        schedule_flush = true;
      }
      batch = batched_rpcs;
      // Unfortunately we have to hold the monitor on `this' while we do

```
