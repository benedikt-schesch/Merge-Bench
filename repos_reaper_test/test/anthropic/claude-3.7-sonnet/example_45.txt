I'll resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intent and semantics of both sides.

```java
  public void updateGameSettings(final GameOptions newOptions) {
    this.options.update(newOptions);
    notifyGameOptionsChanged();
  }

  public Set<Integer> getCustomDeckIds() {
    return customDecksIds;
  }
  
  public Set<String> getCardcastDeckIds() {
    return cardcastDeckIds;
  }

  /**
   * Get information about this game, without the game's password.
   * <br/>

```

The conflict shows two different methods: one for retrieving custom deck IDs (as integers) and another for retrieving Cardcast deck IDs (as strings). These appear to be two different features rather than a rename or modification of the same feature, so I've kept both methods intact.
