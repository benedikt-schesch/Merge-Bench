I'll resolve the merge conflict in the provided snippet by analyzing the intent and semantics of both changes.

```java
	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;
	private BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas mBuildableBitmapTextureAtlas;
	private BaseTextureRegion[] mSVGTestTextureRegions;

	// ===========================================================
	// Constructors
	// ===========================================================

```

The conflict appears to be renaming a variable from `mBuildableTexture` of type `BuildableBitmapTexture` to `mBuildableBitmapTextureAtlas` of type `BuildableBitmapTextureAtlas`. The newer change (from the incoming commit 91801fd) seems to reflect an updated class/type name that's more specific and descriptive, so I've kept that version.
