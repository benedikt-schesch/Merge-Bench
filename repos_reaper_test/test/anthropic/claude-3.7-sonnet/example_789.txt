I'll resolve the merge conflict for the given Java code snippet. Based on the context, it seems that the code from the target branch (d54360...) is adding a new method `deserialize` that's not present in the current HEAD. This is a straightforward addition that doesn't conflict with existing functionality.

```java
    serializeInto(buf);

    return buf;
  }

  @Override
  Object deserialize(final ChannelBuffer buf, int cell_size) {
    HBaseRpc.ensureNoCell(cell_size);
    final MutateResponse resp = readProtobuf(buf, MutateResponse.PARSER);
    return null;
  }

  /** Serialize the raw underlying `Put' into the given buffer.  */
  void serializeInto(final ChannelBuffer buf) {
    buf.writeByte(CODE); // Code for a `Put' parameter.
    buf.writeByte(CODE); // Code again (see HBASE-2877).
    buf.writeByte(1);    // Put#PUT_VERSION.  Stick to v1 here for now.

```
