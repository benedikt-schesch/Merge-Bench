Looking at this merge conflict, I see that the only difference is the diamond operator syntax. The HEAD version uses `new ArrayList<User>()` and `new ArrayList<Player>()`, while the incoming change (from commit 5adedd24) uses the diamond operator shorthand `new ArrayList<>()`. The diamond operator is a Java 7+ feature that allows for type inference, making the code more concise while maintaining type safety.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
    }
  }

  private void skipIdlePlayers() {
    killRoundTimer();
    final List<User> playersToRemove = new ArrayList<>();
    final List<Player> playersToUpdateStatus = new ArrayList<>();
    synchronized (roundPlayers) {

      for (final Player player : roundPlayers) {
        final List<WhiteCard> cards = playedCards.getCards(player);
        if (cards == null || cards.size() < blackCard.getPick()) {
```

I resolved in favor of the diamond operator syntax (`<>`) as it's a more modern and concise Java practice while maintaining the same functionality.
