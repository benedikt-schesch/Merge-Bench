Looking at the merge conflict, both sides are trying to render the same information about making a repository public, but they differ in where they place the bold text formatting. Let me resolve this conflict:

```java
        return event.payload.action + " " + "<b>" + event.repo.name + "#" + event.payload.issue.number + "</b>";
      case MemberEvent:
        return " " + event.payload.action + " " + "<b>" + event.payload.member.login + "</b>" + " " + " to " + event.repo.name;
      case PublicEvent:
        if (event.repo != null) {
          return " made <b>" + event.repo.name + "</b> public";
        } else {
          return "";
        }
      case PullRequestEvent:
        String action = event.payload.action;
```
