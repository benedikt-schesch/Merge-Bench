Looking at this merge conflict, one side has added curly braces to the `if` statement while the other side doesn't have them. The intent is clearly to add better code structure with braces. Since adding braces is generally a good practice for code maintainability and prevents bugs when adding additional statements, I'll resolve to include the braces.

```java
                    && config.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT)) {
                nativeLandscape = true;
            }

            int orientationCompensation = mOrientation; // + (nativeLandscape ? 0 : 90);
            if (orientationCompensation == 90) {
                orientationCompensation += 180;
            } else if (orientationCompensation == 270) {
                orientationCompensation -= 180;
            }

```
