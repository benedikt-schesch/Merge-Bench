I'll resolve the merge conflict in the code snippet. Looking at the conflict, one side (HEAD) includes a blank line after the comment "// Parcelable implementation", while the other side (0b628c40c6a74e31e3c63b0b545670b5fc2b68c0) removes this blank line.

Since this is just about whitespace and doesn't affect functionality, I'll resolve it by preserving the style with the blank line for better readability:

```java
            return new GalgoOptions(this);
        }
    }

    // Parcelable implementation

    private GalgoOptions(Parcel source) {
        numberOfLines = source.readInt();
        backgroundColor = source.readInt();
        textColor = source.readInt();
        errorTextColor = source.readInt();

```
