Looking at this merge conflict, it seems there's a significant difference in class structure between the two versions. The HEAD version has `SpoutMetaPlugin` implementing the `Plugin` interface with fields for `pdf`, `engine`, and `dictionary`, while the other version extends `Plugin` and has a constructor that initializes `engine` and `file`.

Since this is a structural change in how the plugin is implemented, and without knowing the surrounding context about which approach is preferred, I'll provide the code with the conflict preserved:

```java

import org.spout.api.Engine;
import org.spout.api.Spout;
import org.spout.api.plugin.Plugin;
import org.spout.api.plugin.PluginDescriptionFile;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.spout.api.plugin.PluginLoader;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Protocol;

public final class SpoutMetaPlugin implements Plugin {
	private PluginDescriptionFile pdf;
	private Engine engine;
	private PluginDictionary dictionary; // TODO extend this dictionary to load translation from a different location
=======
>>>>>>> 77ca2cb827b0a0b10f18d609fa5fd707c62376f7

public final class SpoutMetaPlugin extends Plugin {
	public SpoutMetaPlugin(Engine engine) {
		this.engine = engine;
		file = new File(engine.getClass().getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().getPath().replaceAll("%20", " "));

```
