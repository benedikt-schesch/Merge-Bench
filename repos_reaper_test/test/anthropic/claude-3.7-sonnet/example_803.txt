Looking at the code snippet, I can see a merge conflict involving a server version check. The RIGHT side adds a check that throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` for server versions greater than or equal to `RegionClient.SERVER_VERSION_095_OR_ABOVE`, while the LEFT side doesn't have this check.

The intent of the RIGHT side is clearly to prevent row locks from being used with newer HBase versions. Since this is a meaningful validation that adds safety to the code, I'll keep the right side's change.

```java
    return size;
  }

  /** Serializes this request.  */
  ChannelBuffer serialize(final byte server_version) {
    if (server_version >= RegionClient.SERVER_VERSION_095_OR_ABOVE) {
      throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Row locks are not supported with"
                                              + " this version of HBase ("
                                              + server_version + ").");
    }
    final ChannelBuffer buf = newBuffer(server_version,
                                        predictSerializedSize());
    buf.writeInt(2);  // Number of parameters.

    writeHBaseByteArray(buf, region.name());
```
