Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PagePaymentOptions extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * Whether the business accepts American Express as a payment option.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter
```

I've resolved this conflict by keeping the `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;` line. This is appropriate because serialVersionUID is important for serialization in Java classes that extend serializable types (like AbstractFacebookType likely does). Removing this field could cause compatibility issues if instances of this class are serialized/deserialized.
