Looking at the merge conflict, both sides are trying to accomplish the same goal - creating an array of players and then a list of player names. The key differences are:

1. HEAD uses `players.toArray(new Player[players.size()])` while the other branch uses `players.toArray(new Player[0])` which is a more modern Java idiom
2. HEAD uses `new ArrayList<String>(playersCopy.length)` while the other branch uses the diamond operator `new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length)` which is a Java 7+ feature

Since the other branch appears to be using more modern Java conventions without changing the functionality, I'll resolve in favor of that version:

```java
    info.put(GameInfo.HOST, host.getUser().getNickname());
    info.put(GameInfo.STATE, state.toString());
    info.put(GameInfo.GAME_OPTIONS, options.serialize(includePassword));
    info.put(GameInfo.HAS_PASSWORD, options.password != null && !options.password.equals(""));

    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    final List<String> playerNames = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      playerNames.add(player.getUser().getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.PLAYERS, playerNames);

```
