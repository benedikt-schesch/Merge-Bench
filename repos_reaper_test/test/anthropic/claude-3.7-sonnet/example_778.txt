I'll resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the semantics of both sides.

Looking at this code:
1. The LEFT side (HEAD) simply assigns `versions` to the instance variable `this.versions`
2. The RIGHT side (d54360...) does a more complex assignment that preserves some flag bits with `(this.versions & EXIST_FLAG)` while setting the version value with a bit shift operation `(versions << 1)`.

The right side appears to be preserving a flag in the low bit while using the other bits for the version value. This seems like an intentional design pattern to pack multiple pieces of information into a single integer. The left side would lose this flag information.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
  public GetRequest maxVersions(final int versions) {
    if (versions <= 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Need a strictly positive number: "
                                         + versions);
    }
    this.versions = (versions << 1) | (this.versions & EXIST_FLAG);
    return this;
  }

  /**
   * Returns the maximum number of versions to return for each cell scanned.

```
