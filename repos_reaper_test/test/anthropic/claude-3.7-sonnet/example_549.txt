Looking at this merge conflict, I see it's just a difference in code formatting. Both sides are trying to get the `ApplicationPath` annotation from the `application.getClass()` - one has the method call and parameter on separate lines, and the other has it on the same line but with different line breaks.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                .setUseSectionNamingPackageStrategy(useSectionNamingPackageStrategy);

        if (baseRef != null) {
            collectInfo.setApplicationPath(baseRef.getPath());
        } else if (application != null) {
            ApplicationPath applicationPath = application.getClass()
                    .getAnnotation(ApplicationPath.class);
            if (applicationPath != null) {
                collectInfo.setApplicationPath(applicationPath.value());
            }
        }

```

I chose the HEAD version because it follows a more consistent formatting pattern with the method call on a new line.
