Looking at the merge conflict, I can see two different approaches to ensure we have enough bytes readable from the buffer. The HEAD version uses mark/reset to verify it can skip ahead, while the new version uses a more direct `ensureReadable` method call.

Since the comment above mentions this "will have to change to be able to do streaming RPCs", and the newer approach appears to be a more direct implementation with a dedicated method, I'll preserve the newer approach.

```java
      try {
        HBaseRpc.checkArrayLength(buf, length);
        // Make sure we have that many bytes readable.
        // This will have to change to be able to do streaming RPCs where we
        // deserialize parts of the response as it comes off the wire.
        ensureReadable(buf, length);
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        LOG.error("WTF?  RPC #" + rpcid + ": ", e);
      }
    }
