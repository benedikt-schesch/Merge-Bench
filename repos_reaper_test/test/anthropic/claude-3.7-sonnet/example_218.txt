Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
    private PigServer pig;
    
    @Before
    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
        pig = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
    }
    
    Boolean[] nullFlags = new Boolean[] { false, true };

    @Test
    public void testAdd() throws Throwable {
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
        
```

The conflict has been resolved by choosing the version from the branch being merged in (1488b22). The change appears to be updating from using a constant `MAPREDUCE` to using the enum value `ExecType.MAPREDUCE`, which is likely the more modern/correct approach. The incoming change also adds the `nullFlags` array that appears to be needed for tests.
