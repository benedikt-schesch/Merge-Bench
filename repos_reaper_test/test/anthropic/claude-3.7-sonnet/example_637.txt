Looking at this merge conflict, I see two key differences:

1. How the JSON data is accessed: `.get("data").toString()` vs `.getJsonObject("data").toString()`
2. The target class for deserialization: `ProfilePictureSource.class` vs `User.Picture.class`

Based on the method name context and patterns, I believe the newer version (from a17acec) is likely intended, as it uses a more type-specific getter method and appears to use a nested class structure which may better match the codebase's architecture.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

    String picJson = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString();
    picture = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(picJson, User.Picture.class);
  }

  /**
   * The user's hometown name.
   * 
```
