Looking at this merge conflict, it appears both sides are adding new static integer constants to define dialog types. The values are different and don't conflict with each other. Since both changes are adding unique constants for different purpose dialogs, I'll merge them while preserving the new constants from both sides.

```java
    static final int DIALOG_MESSAGE_CLICK = 25;
    static final int DIALOG_GOTO_PARENT = 28;
    static final int DIALOG_EDIT = 29;
    static final int DIALOG_DELETE = 30;
    static final int DIALOG_COMPOSE = 31;
    static final int DIALOG_FIND = 32;
    static final int DIALOG_REPORT = 33;
    static final int DIALOG_THREAD_CLICK = 34;
    static final int DIALOG_VIEW_PROFILE = 35;

    // progress dialogs
    static final int DIALOG_LOGGING_IN = 1000;
    static final int DIALOG_SUBMITTING = 1004;
    static final int DIALOG_REPLYING = 1005;
```
