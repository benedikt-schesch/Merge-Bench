Looking at this merge conflict, it seems both sides are making independent changes to run after `filesystem.postStartup()`:
- The HEAD version is starting the `WorldSavingThread`
- The other branch (67bcb76) is calling `filesystem.notifyInstalls()`

Since these appear to be separate operations that don't conflict functionally, both should be included after `filesystem.postStartup()`.

```java
			}
		}
		getEventManager().registerEvents(listener, this);
		getEventManager().callEvent(new EngineStartEvent());
		filesystem.postStartup();
		WorldSavingThread.startThread();
		filesystem.notifyInstalls();
		Spout.info("Done Loading, ready for players.");
	}

	@Override
	protected void setupBindings(SpoutConfiguration config) {

```
