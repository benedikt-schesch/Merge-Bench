Looking at this merge conflict, it seems like both sides are trying to prepare arguments for a constructor that takes a `String[]`. 

The HEAD version converts `args` from a collection to a `String[]` using `toArray()` and then wraps it in an `Object[]` array.

The other version (1488b22c) skips the conversion step and directly puts `args` into the wrapper array.

Since `args` appears to be a collection of strings, and the constructor expects a `String[]`, the HEAD version with the explicit conversion to array is likely correct. If `args` were already a `String[]`, both approaches would work, but the explicit conversion ensures type safety.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
        }
        catch(NoSuchMethodException nme) {
            // Second channce. Try with var arg constructor
            try {
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(String[].class);
                String[] argArr = args.toArray(new String[0]) ;
                Object[] wrappedArgs = new Object[1] ;
                wrappedArgs[0] = argArr ;
                ret =  c.newInstance(wrappedArgs);
            }
            catch(Throwable e){
                // bad luck
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
```
