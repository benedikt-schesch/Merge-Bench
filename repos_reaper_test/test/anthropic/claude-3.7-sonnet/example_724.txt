Looking at the merge conflict, both versions are implementing the same method `isEquals` which checks if two objects are equal, handling null values properly. The version on the right side (`41bc0309ba`) is a more concise implementation using a ternary operator, while maintaining the same logic as the left side (HEAD).

Here's the resolved code:

```java

    public static boolean isLeast(int[] objs, int count) {
        return null != objs && objs.length >= count;
    }

    public static boolean isEquals(Object a, Object b) {
        return (a == null) ? (b == null) : a.equals(b);
    }

    public static String trim(CharSequence charSequence) {
        return null == charSequence ? null : charSequence.toString().trim();
    }

```

I've chosen the implementation from the right side as it's more concise and elegant while maintaining the exact same behavior as the original implementation.
