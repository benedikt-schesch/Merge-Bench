Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine which version is correct. Let's analyze what both sides are trying to do:

- The HEAD version calls the superclass constructor with `DELETE` as the first parameter, followed by the other arguments
- The other version doesn't include this `DELETE` parameter

Based on the context, it seems the HEAD version is adding a parameter to specify the type of operation, which is likely part of an API change or enhancement.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
                        final byte[] key,
                        final byte[] family,
                        final byte[][] qualifiers,
                        final long timestamp,
                        final long lockid) {
    super(DELETE, table, key, family == null ? WHOLE_ROW : family, timestamp, lockid);
    if (family != null) {
      KeyValue.checkFamily(family);
    }

    if (qualifiers != null) {

```

I chose the HEAD version because it likely represents a newer implementation that specifies the operation type explicitly, which improves code clarity and type safety.
