Looking at the merge conflict, the difference is in the namespace URI of the `Event` element. One side has a single `/` after `metadata-1-0` while the other side has a double `//`. 

Based on common XML namespace conventions and the rest of the code, the correct version would typically have a single slash. The double slash in the namespace URI appears to be a typo.

Here's the resolved code:

```java

        assertEquals(renderingControlLastChange.toString(), "");
        mp.setMute(true);
        Thread.sleep(500);
        lastChangeExpected =
                "<Event xmlns=\"urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0/RCS/\">" +
                        "<InstanceID val=\"0\">" +
                        "<Volume channel=\"Master\" val=\"0\"/>" +
                        "<Mute channel=\"Master\" val=\"1\"/>" +
                        "</InstanceID>" +
                "</Event>";

```
