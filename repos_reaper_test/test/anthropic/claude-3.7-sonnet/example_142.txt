Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that one side is using `MiniGenericCluster` while the other is using `MiniCluster` as the parameter type. The HEAD version has a simpler method signature, while the other version includes additional code to handle Windows path separators.

Here's the resolved snippet, preserving the full context and merging the intent from both sides:

```java
            throw new IOException(e);
        }

    }

    static public void copyFromClusterToLocal(MiniGenericCluster cluster,
            String fileNameOnCluster, String localFileName) throws IOException {
        if(Util.WINDOWS){
            fileNameOnCluster = fileNameOnCluster.replace('\\','/');
            localFileName = localFileName.replace('\\','/');
        }
	    File parent = new File(localFileName).getParentFile();
	    if (!parent.exists()) {
	        parent.mkdirs();
	    }
	    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(localFileName));

```
