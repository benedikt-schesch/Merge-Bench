Looking at this merge conflict, I see that the main branch (HEAD) is adding a resource map array, while the other branch (d71053b) is adding a method to set toast resources. These appear to be different features that don't conflict logically, though they're placed at the same location.

Here's how I would resolve the conflict:

```java
        intent.setClass(mActivity, cls);
        mActivity.startActivity(intent);

    }

    private static final int[] mResourceMap = new int[] {
            R.drawable.point_right, R.drawable.point_center,
            R.drawable.point_left };

    public void setToastResource(int[] resourceIds) {
        mToastEnabled = true;
        mToastResourcesMap = resourceIds;
    }

    private void maybeShowToast(int whichActicity) {
        if (mToastEnabled && whichActicity < mToastResourcesMap.length) {
            final Toast myToast = new Toast(mActivity);
            final ImageView myView = new ImageView(mActivity);

```
