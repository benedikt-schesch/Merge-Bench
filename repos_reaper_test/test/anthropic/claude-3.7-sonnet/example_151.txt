Looking at the merge conflict, it appears that both sides are trying to create a `GruntParser` instance, but the right side (from commit 2125666c) is passing an additional parameter `myPig` to the constructor. This suggests that the constructor signature might have been updated to require a Pig instance parameter. To properly resolve this, I would use the version that includes the additional parameter.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "explain b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```
