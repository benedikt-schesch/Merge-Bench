Looking at the merge conflict, I can see both sides are calling the same method with the same parameters. The only difference is the formatting - one side has the last parameter on a separate line, and the other has it on the same line as the rest of the parameters.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
>>>>>>> 1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f
            System.exit(1);
        }
        Reference baseRef = endpoint != null ? new Reference(endpoint) : null;
        return JaxRsIntrospector.getDefinition(jaxrsApplication,
                applicationName, resources, baseRef, useSectionNamingPackageStrategy);
    }

    /**
     * Returns the value according to its index.
     * 
```
