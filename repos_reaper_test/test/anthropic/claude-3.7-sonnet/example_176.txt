Looking at the merge conflict, I can see it's about handling imports. One side has imported a specific `PigMapReduce` class, while the other side has commented out that import and replaced it with a different `PigMapReduce` class from another package. The resolution should maintain the correct import needed for the codebase.

```java
import java.util.jar.JarEntry;
import java.util.jar.JarInputStream;
import java.util.jar.JarOutputStream;
import java.util.zip.ZipEntry;

import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.PigMapReduce;


public class JarManager {
