Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are modifying the `testHelloWorld` method with very similar changes. The key differences are:

1. The HEAD version throws an Exception and has a different string in the toast message
2. The other version doesn't throw an Exception and has a different toast message

Given the abstract method declaration above (`runScript` which throws Exception), it seems appropriate to keep the exception handling. The toast message difference appears to be a matter of preference.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

    protected abstract void helpSetUp() throws Exception;
    public abstract void runScript(final String js) throws Exception;

    @SmallTest
    public void testHelloWorld() throws Exception {
        runScript("Log.d('RhinoTest', 'Helloworld, js');" + "toast('东北人都是活雷锋');");
    }

    /** TODO use TextUtils#concat */
    /**
     *

```

I kept the `throws Exception` declaration to match the abstract method, and I chose the toast message from the incoming change as it appears to be the more recent intention.
