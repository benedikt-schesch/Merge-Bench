Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are declaring a private processor variable but with slightly different names: `LocalClassifierProcessor` vs `LocalLearnerProcessor`. This seems to be a case where a class was renamed, and both sides of the merge are trying to use their respective class names.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
 * 
 */
public final class SingleClassifier implements Learner, AdaptiveLearner, Configurable {

	private static final long serialVersionUID = 684111382631697031L;
	
	private LocalLearnerProcessor learnerP;
		
	private Stream resultStream;

	private Instances dataset;

	public ClassOption learnerOption = new ClassOption("learner", 'l',

```

I chose the newer name `LocalLearnerProcessor` from the incoming change, as it appears to be a deliberate class renaming (from `LocalClassifierProcessor` to `LocalLearnerProcessor`).
