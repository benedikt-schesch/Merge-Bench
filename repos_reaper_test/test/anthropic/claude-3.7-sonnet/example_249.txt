Looking at this conflict, the only difference appears to be whitespace/indentation. The HEAD version has less indentation for the assignment operation while the 1cb2531c version has more indentation for better code alignment.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
     * @throws IOException on failure
     */
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    static void passLoadSignature(LoadFunc loadFunc, int inputIndex,
            Configuration conf) throws IOException {
        List<String> inpSignatureLists = 
                (ArrayList<String>)ObjectSerializer.deserialize(
                        conf.get("pig.inpSignatures"));
        // signature can be null for intermediate jobs where it will not
        // be required to be passed down
        if(inpSignatureLists.get(inputIndex) != null) {
            loadFunc.setUDFContextSignature(inpSignatureLists.get(inputIndex));
            conf.set("pig.loader.signature", inpSignatureLists.get(inputIndex));
```

I chose the version with more indentation (from 1cb2531c) as it improves code readability with better alignment of the nested parentheses.
