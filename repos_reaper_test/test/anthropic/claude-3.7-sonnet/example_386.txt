Looking at the merge conflict, I see a few differences:

1. Left side uses `@BeforeEach` annotation (JUnit 5) while right side uses `@Before` (JUnit 4)
2. Left side omits the `public` modifier
3. Left side initializes the list with `newArrayList()` while right side uses `new ArrayList<>()`

This looks like a migration from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5, so I'll resolve by keeping the JUnit 5 style while incorporating the more explicit initialization from the right side.

```java
	private List<ProjectFacade> projects;
	private CoreRegistry coreRegistry;
	private ProjectSet projectSet;
	private EclipseWorkspace workspace;

	@BeforeEach
	void inContext() throws CoreException {
		projects = new ArrayList<>();
		projectSet = mock(ProjectSet.class);
		projects.add(new ProjectFacade(project));
		coreRegistry = mock(CoreRegistry.class);
		CoreFactory coreFactory = new CoreFactory(null);
		workspace = new EclipseWorkspace(projectSet, coreRegistry, coreFactory, new SystemClassPathJarLocator());

```
