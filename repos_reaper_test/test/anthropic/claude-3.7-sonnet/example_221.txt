Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that the only difference is whitespace. The HEAD version has a closing bracket without trailing whitespace, while the other branch version has trailing whitespace after the closing bracket.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
        
        if (lo instanceof LOCogroup) {
            assertTrue(((LOCogroup) lo).getRequestedParallelism() == 16);
        } else {
            fail("Error: Unexpected Parse Tree output");
        }
    }
    
    
    
    
```

I've resolved the conflict by keeping the version without trailing whitespace, as trailing whitespace is generally unnecessary and often automatically trimmed by code formatters.
