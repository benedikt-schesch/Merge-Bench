Looking at this merge conflict, I see that the only difference is whether the `getString()` method in the `DoubleLocalizable` interface has the `public` modifier explicitly specified or not.

In Java interfaces, methods are implicitly public and abstract by default, so adding the `public` keyword is optional and doesn't change the semantics of the code.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
   */
  public interface DoubleLocalizable {
    /**
     * @return The first user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     */
    String getString();

    /**
     * @return The second user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     */

```

I've chosen the cleaner version without the explicit `public` modifier, as that's the standard Java style and matches the intent of both changes (defining a public interface method).
