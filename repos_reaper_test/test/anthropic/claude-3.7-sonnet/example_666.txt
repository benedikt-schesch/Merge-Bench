Looking at the merge conflict, there's a difference in how the `eclipseProject` is created. The HEAD version uses a factory method pattern, while the other branch creates an `AdtEclipseAndroidProject` directly with additional parameters.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
    }

    public void configureClasspath(IMavenProjectFacade facade, IClasspathDescriptor classpath, IProgressMonitor monitor)
            throws CoreException {
        final MavenAndroidProject mavenProject = mavenProjectFactory.createAndroidProject(facade.getMavenProject());
        final EclipseAndroidProject eclipseProject = new AdtEclipseAndroidProject(registry, facade.getProject(), classpath);
        try {
            for (RawClasspathConfigurer configurer : rawClasspathConfigurers) {
                configurer.configure(mavenProject, eclipseProject, classpath);
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {

```

I chose the implementation from the newer commit (4b0f0ad) because it appears to be an intentional change to use a concrete implementation with more parameters, suggesting it provides needed functionality that wasn't available in the factory implementation.
