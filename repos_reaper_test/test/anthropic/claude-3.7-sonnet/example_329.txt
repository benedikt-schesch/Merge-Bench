Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both changes:

1. Original code: Checks if `position` is less than the count in the adapter.
2. Incoming change: Also checks if `position` is greater than or equal to 0 as well.

The incoming change is adding a bounds check to prevent negative indices, which is a defensive programming practice and would prevent potential array index out of bounds exceptions. This seems like a clear improvement to the code without changing the existing functionality.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
	@Override
	protected User getContextItemUser(int position) {
		// position = position - 1;
		Log.d(TAG, "list position:" + position);
		// 加入footer跳过footer
		if (position >= 0 && position < mUserListAdapter.getCount()) {

			User item = (User) mUserListAdapter.getItem(position);
			if (item == null) {
				return null;
			} else {
```
