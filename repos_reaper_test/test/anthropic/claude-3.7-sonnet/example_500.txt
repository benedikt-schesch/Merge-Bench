Looking at the merge conflict, I see two lines that are in conflict, where one branch is using `BitmapTexture` and the other is using `BitmapTextureAtlas`. This appears to be a change in the type of texture being used in the engine or framework.

Based on analyzing this code:
- `TiledTextureRegion` variables are present in both versions
- This suggests that either texture class can work with these regions

Given the commit hash (91801fd...) is very specific, it likely represents an intentional change from `BitmapTexture` to `BitmapTextureAtlas`, which might be part of an API upgrade or improvement.

Here's the resolved code:

```java

	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;

	private TiledTextureRegion mBoxFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mCircleFaceTextureRegion;

	private Scene mScene;

```

I chose the newer version (`BitmapTextureAtlas`) as it likely represents an upgrade or improvement to the API, which would be compatible with the TiledTextureRegion usage that remains unchanged in both versions.
