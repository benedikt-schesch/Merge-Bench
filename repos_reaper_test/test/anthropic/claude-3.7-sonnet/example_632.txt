Looking at this merge conflict, I see that both sides are defining a `picture` field but with different types: `ProfilePictureSource` in one version and `Picture` in another. To resolve this conflict, I need to consider which type is more appropriate, but without more context about these types and their usage, I cannot make a definite determination.

Since I don't have enough context to confidently choose one implementation over the other, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java

   * @since 1.6.16

  @Getter
  @Setter
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private ProfilePictureSource picture;
=======
  private Picture picture;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  /**
   * Duplicate mapping for "hometown" since FB can return it differently in different situations.
   * 
   * -- GETTER -- The user's hometown.
