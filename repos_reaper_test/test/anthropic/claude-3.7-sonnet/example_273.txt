Looking at the merge conflict, both sides are identical, differing only in whitespace (the trailing space in the right side). Since the actual content is the same, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the line without the trailing space.

```java
        POPackage pkg = new POPackage(new OperatorKey(scope,nig.getNextNodeId(scope)));
        Packager pkgr = new Packager();
        pkg.setPkgr(pkgr);
        pkgr.setKeyType(DataType.CHARARRAY);
        pkg.setNumInps(1);
        boolean[] inner = {false};
        pkgr.setInner(inner);
        mro.reducePlan.add(pkg);

        // Lets start building the plan which will have the sort
        // for the foreach

```
