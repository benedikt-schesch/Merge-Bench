Based on the merge conflict, I can see that one side is adding a log statement and the other side is removing it (or never had it). The conflict appears to be simple - it's about whether to include a logging statement before posting a message to the event bus.

Here's the resolved snippet, preserving the context and spacing:

```java
                            @Override
                            public void onFinished(Void result) {
                                UiThread.getInstance().post(new Runnable() {
                                    @Override
                                    public void run() {
                                        Logger.log(SmsSentReceiver.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed message deleted ");
                                        App.bus.post(new ReloadMessagesEvent());
                                    }
                                });
                            }

```

I chose to keep the logging statement since it provides additional debugging information that seems helpful for tracking what's happening when a message is deleted, and including it doesn't affect the functionality of posting the reload event.
