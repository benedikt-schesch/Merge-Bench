Looking at the merge conflict, I need to determine the intent. One side (HEAD) has no imports at the beginning, while the other side (`a17acec`) is adding an import for `RestFBLogger.CLIENT_LOGGER`. Since removing imports typically doesn't make sense unless the code using them has also been removed, I'll accept the additional import line.

```java
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
 * THE SOFTWARE.
 */
package com.restfb;

import static com.restfb.logging.RestFBLogger.CLIENT_LOGGER;
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.isBlank;
import static com.restfb.util.StringUtils.trimToEmpty;
import static com.restfb.util.UrlUtils.urlEncode;
import static java.util.Arrays.asList;
