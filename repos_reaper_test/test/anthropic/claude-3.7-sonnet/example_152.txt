Looking at this merge conflict, it appears to be in the initialization of a `GruntParser` object:

1. On the HEAD side, `GruntParser` is initialized with just a `StringReader(script)` parameter
2. On the other side (2125666c...), it's initialized with both `StringReader(script)` and `myPig` parameters

Based on the context, it seems the intent of the change is to provide the `myPig` object as an additional parameter to the `GruntParser` constructor, which likely represents a Pig context that the parser needs. This appears to be a valid enhancement to the code.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "dump b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```
