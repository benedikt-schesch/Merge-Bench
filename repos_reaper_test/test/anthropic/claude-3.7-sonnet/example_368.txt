Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are changing the version number of the Google API Client Library for Java. The conflict is about which version number to use. Since `1.4.0-alpha` (on the right side) is higher than `1.3.3-alpha` (on the left side), and this appears to be a version increment, I'll resolve in favor of the newer version:

```java
  /**
   * Current version of the Google API Client Library for Java.
   *
   * @since 1.3
   */
  public static final String VERSION = "1.4.0-alpha";

  /**
   * Line separator to use for this OS, i.e. {@code "\n"} or {@code "\r\n"}.
   */
  public static final String LINE_SEPARATOR = System.getProperty("line.separator");

```
