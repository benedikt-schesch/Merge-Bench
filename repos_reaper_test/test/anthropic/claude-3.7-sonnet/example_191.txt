Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are making similar changes to handle arguments. The difference is that one side is using `args.size()` and the other is using `args.length`, suggesting the type of `args` is changing from a Collection to an array.

Given the context, I'll resolve this conflict by adopting the changes from the second version (using `args.length`), as that appears to be the newer implementation.

```java
            throw new RuntimeException("Cannot instantiate:" + className, ioe) ;
        }

        try {
            // Do normal instantiation
            if (args != null && args.length > 0) {
                Class paramTypes[] = new Class[args.length];
                for (int i = 0; i < paramTypes.length; i++) {
                    paramTypes[i] = String.class;
                }
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(paramTypes);

```
