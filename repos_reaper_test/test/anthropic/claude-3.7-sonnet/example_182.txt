Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that it involves an import statement for `ExecType`. The conflict is between importing `org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType` (from HEAD) versus importing `org.apache.pig.ExecType` (from the commit 1488b22c).

This appears to be a case where a class has been refactored and moved from being an inner class of `PigServer` to its own class in the same package. Since the newer commit is importing it from its new location, I'll resolve by using the newer version:

```java
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.apache.log4j.Level;
import org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender;
import org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout;
import org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator;
import org.apache.pig.ExecType;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.HExecutionEngine;
import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;
import org.apache.pig.impl.io.FileLocalizer;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.LogicalPlanBuilder;
import org.apache.pig.impl.util.JarManager;

```
