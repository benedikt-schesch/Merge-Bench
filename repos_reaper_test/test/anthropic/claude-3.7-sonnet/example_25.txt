Looking at this merge conflict, it appears one side is importing world event classes, while the other side is importing a configuration exception class. Since these are just import statements and they don't conflict with each other functionally, I'll include both sets of imports in the resolved code.

```java
import org.spout.api.command.CommandSource;
import org.spout.api.command.annotated.AnnotatedCommandExecutorFactory;
import org.spout.api.event.EventManager;
import org.spout.api.event.SimpleEventManager;
import org.spout.api.event.server.permissions.PermissionGetAllWithNodeEvent;
import org.spout.api.event.world.WorldLoadEvent;
import org.spout.api.event.world.WorldUnloadEvent;
import org.spout.api.exception.ConfigurationException;
import org.spout.api.exception.SpoutRuntimeException;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Point;
import org.spout.api.inventory.recipe.RecipeManager;
```
