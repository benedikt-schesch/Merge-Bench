Looking at this merge conflict, I see that one side (HEAD) is getting the result from the packager's `getNext()` method, storing it in a variable `r`, and then potentially modifying the tuple inside with an `illustratorMarkup` call before returning. The other side (88ae4a5) is directly returning the result of `pkgr.getNext()` without any modification.

Since the HEAD version includes extra functionality (the illustrator markup), I'll resolve in favor of preserving this functionality:

```java
            // and return it.
            pkgr.attachInput(key, dbs, readOnce);
            detachInput();
        }

        Result r = pkgr.getNext();
        Tuple packedTup = (Tuple) r.result;
        packedTup = illustratorMarkup(null, packedTup, 0);
        return r;
    }

    public Packager getPkgr() {
        return pkgr;
    }

```
