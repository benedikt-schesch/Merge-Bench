Looking at this merge conflict, it appears there are two different buttons being added to the `ViewHolder`: `followBtn` from the current branch and `testBtn` from the other branch. Without additional context about the intended functionality, it's difficult to determine whether one should replace the other or if both should be kept.

Here's the resolved code with both buttons included, which is the safest approach without knowing the specific intent:

```java
			ViewHolder holder = new ViewHolder();
			holder.profileImage = (ImageView) view.findViewById(R.id.profile_image);
			holder.screenName = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.screen_name);
			holder.userId = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.user_id);
			//holder.lastStatus = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.last_status);
			holder.followBtn = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.follow_btn);
			holder.testBtn = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.test_btn);
		
			view.setTag(holder);
		} else {
			view = convertView;
		}
```
