Looking at this merge conflict, I see it's involving a texture type in a Java class. One branch is using `BitmapTexture` and the other is using `BitmapTextureAtlas`. This appears to be a change in the type of texture being used, possibly due to a library upgrade or refactoring.

Without additional context about the codebase, I'll resolve this by accepting the newer implementation (the incoming change with `BitmapTextureAtlas`):

```java
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	protected MenuScene mMenuScene;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mMenuTexture;
	protected TextureRegion mMenuResetTextureRegion;
	protected TextureRegion mMenuQuitTextureRegion;

	// ===========================================================
	// Constructors
