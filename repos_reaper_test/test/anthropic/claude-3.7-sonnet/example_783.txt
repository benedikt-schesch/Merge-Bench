Looking at the merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:
- The original code seems to be calculating `method.length`
- The new code appears to be using `method(server_version).length` which suggests a function call to `method` that takes `server_version` as a parameter

Based on the surrounding context, which includes references to `server_version`, it seems the newer version (d543609) is trying to make the method name dependent on the server version, which is likely the correct semantic intent.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
    // Add extra bytes for the RPC header:
    //   4 bytes: Payload size (always present, even in HBase 0.95+).
    //   4 bytes: RPC ID.
    //   2 bytes: Length of the method name.
    //   N bytes: The method name.
    final int header = 4 + 4 + 2 + method(server_version).length
      // Add extra bytes for the RPC header used in HBase 0.92 and above:
      //   1 byte:  RPC header version.
      //   8 bytes: Client version.  Yeah, 8 bytes, WTF seriously.
      //   4 bytes: Method fingerprint.
      + (server_version < RegionClient.SERVER_VERSION_092_OR_ABOVE ? 0
```
