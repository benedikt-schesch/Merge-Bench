Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that the line importing `br.com.caelum.iogi.Instantiator` is present in the HEAD version but is removed in the other branch. Since this is simply an import statement, I need to determine whether this import is needed or not. Without seeing the rest of the code, I can't be certain, but typically an import would only be removed if it's no longer needed in the code.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
import java.util.Set;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import br.com.caelum.iogi.spi.DependencyProvider;
import br.com.caelum.iogi.spi.ParameterNamesProvider;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.Convert;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.Converter;
import br.com.caelum.vraptor.Intercepts;
```

I've chosen to accept the removal of the import, which is the change from the incoming branch. This assumes that the `Instantiator` class is no longer used in the code. If the class is still referenced elsewhere in the file, this import would need to be kept.
