I'll resolve this merge conflict by considering the intent of both sides. Both sides are trying to assert that the content type of the BinaryAttachment is "application/octet-stream".

```java

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_fallback() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";
    BinaryAttachment att = BinaryAttachment.with("example.json", attachmentData.getBytes());
    assertThat(att).hasContentType("application/octet-stream");
  }

  @Test
  public void checkContentTypeBytes_manual() {
    String attachmentData = "this is a short string";

```
