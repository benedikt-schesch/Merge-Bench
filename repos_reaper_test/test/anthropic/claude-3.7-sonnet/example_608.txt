Based on the merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) includes a `serialVersionUID` declaration while the other side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe) removes it.

Since `serialVersionUID` is important for serialization compatibility in Java classes that implement Serializable (which the parent class `AbstractFacebookType` likely does), I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the `serialVersionUID` declaration.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class VoipInfo extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook("has_permission")
    private Boolean hasPermission;


```
