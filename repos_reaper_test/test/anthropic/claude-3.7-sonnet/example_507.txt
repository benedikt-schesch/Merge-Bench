Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine which texture reference is correct based on the intent of both changes.

The conflict shows two different texture references being used in the SpriteBatch constructor:
1. `this.mBitmapTexture` from the HEAD version
2. `this.mBitmapTextureAtlas` from commit 91801fdd

Based on the code context, this appears to be a change in the variable/reference type being used. Without more context about which one is the correct current implementation, I'll resolve with the most recent change (from the incoming commit):

```java
		
		faceSprite1.setScale(2);
		faceSprite2.setRotation(45);

		/* Create the face and add it to the scene. */
		final SpriteBatch dynamicSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, 2) {
			@Override
			public void onDrawSpriteBatch() {
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
				this.draw(faceSprite2);
			}

```
