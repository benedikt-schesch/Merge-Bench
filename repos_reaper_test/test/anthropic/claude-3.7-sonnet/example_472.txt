Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import Java concurrent utilities. One side imports specific classes (ExecutionException, TimeUnit, TimeoutException) while the other side uses a wildcard import for the entire concurrent package. The wildcard import would include all the specific classes mentioned in the HEAD version.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.testng.Assert.*;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

import javax.annotation.Nonnull;

import net.spy.memcached.MemcachedClient;
import net.spy.memcached.internal.OperationFuture;
```

I've kept the wildcard import (`java.util.concurrent.*`) which encompasses all the specific imports from the HEAD version while maintaining a cleaner import section.
