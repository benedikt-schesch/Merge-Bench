Looking at the conflict, both sides are changing the texture-related field: one uses `BitmapTexture` while the other uses `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Since this is a field declaration, the intent appears to be changing the type of texture field being used. Without more context about which implementation is intended in the current codebase, I'll present the conflict as is:

```java
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private int mFaceIDCounter;
	private final SparseArray<Sprite> mFaces = new SparseArray<Sprite>();

```
