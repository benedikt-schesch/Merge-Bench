Looking at this merge conflict, it appears one side is importing specific classes `Employee` and `Name` from `org.fest.test`, while the other side is importing everything from `org.fest.test` using a wildcard import.

Since a wildcard import (`org.fest.test.*`) includes all classes in that package, including `Employee` and `Name`, I'll resolve the conflict by using the wildcard import, which is more inclusive.

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

import java.util.*;

import org.fest.assertions.internal.PropertySupport;
import org.fest.test.*;
import org.junit.*;

/**
 * Tests for <code>{@link Properties#from(Object[])}</code>.
