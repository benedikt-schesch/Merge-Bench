Looking at this merge conflict, the main difference is using `_service` vs `_manager` for the first part of the test method. The HEAD version uses `_service` consistently throughout the method, while the incoming change uses `_manager` for the first part.

Since the second part of the method (after the conflict) continues to use `_service`, the most consistent resolution is to maintain `_service` throughout the entire method.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
    @Nonnull
    protected abstract SessionManager createSessionManager();

    @Test
    public void testConfigurationFormatMemcachedNodesFeature44() throws LifecycleException {
        _service.setMemcachedNodes( "n1:127.0.0.1:11211" );
        _service.startInternal(_memcachedMock);
        Assert.assertEquals( _service.getNodeIds(), Arrays.asList( "n1" ) );

        _service.setMemcachedNodes( "n1:127.0.0.1:11211 n2:127.0.0.1:11212" );
        _service.startInternal(_memcachedMock);
        Assert.assertEquals( _service.getNodeIds(), Arrays.asList( "n1", "n2" ) );
