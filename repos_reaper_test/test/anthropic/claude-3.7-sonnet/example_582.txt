Looking at this merge conflict, I can see two different implementations for handling a profile picture. Here's the resolution:

```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

    JsonObject picData = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data");
    if (picData != null) {
      picture = picData.getString("url");
    }
  }
}
```

I resolved the conflict by choosing the second implementation (from a17acec0) because:
1. It uses `getJsonObject("data")` which appears to be a direct method for retrieving the data object
2. It seems to extract just the URL string from the data rather than converting the entire object
3. The implementation is simpler and more direct for what appears to be the goal of extracting a picture URL
