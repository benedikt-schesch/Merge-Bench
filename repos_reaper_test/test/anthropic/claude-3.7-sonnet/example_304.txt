Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that both sides are initializing a `Calendar` variable named `birthday` differently, with different dates and time zones. The HEAD version sets a specific datetime with timezone GMT-0300, while the incoming change sets a date with America/Sao_Paulo timezone. 

Since the code is for a test and both seem to be setting up different expected values, I'll need to preserve the intent of one side. Without knowing the exact intent, I'll resolve by choosing the incoming change as it appears to be more recent and includes a comment explaining the date.

```java
		assertThat(deserialized[0], is(instanceOf(Dog.class)));
		Dog dog = (Dog) deserialized[0];
		assertThat(dog.name, is("Brutus"));
		assertThat(dog.age, is(7));

		Calendar birthday = new GregorianCalendar(2011, 03, 04);//04/04/2011
		birthday.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("America/Sao_Paulo"));
		assertThat(dog.birthday, is(birthday));
	}

	@Test
	public void shouldHonorRequestHeaderAcceptCharset() throws Exception {

```
