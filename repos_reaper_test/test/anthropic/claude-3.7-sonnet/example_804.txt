Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that both sides are adding the same `CallQueueTooBigException` mapping to the `REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES` map. The only difference is in the indentation - HEAD uses less indentation while the remote commit (4ba3d9e6a5cf1f6c0217777e9ce9ebff461cc270) aligns the indentation with the other entries in the map.

Since this is purely a formatting difference and the remote version is consistent with the indentation style of the surrounding code, I'll resolve by using the remote version:

```java
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(UnknownRowLockException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new UnknownRowLockException(null, null));
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(VersionMismatchException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new VersionMismatchException(null, null));
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(CallQueueTooBigException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new CallQueueTooBigException(null, null));
    REMOTE_EXCEPTION_TYPES.put(UnknownProtocolException.REMOTE_CLASS,
                               new UnknownProtocolException(null, null));
  }

  /** We don't know the RPC protocol version of the server yet.  */
