Looking at the merge conflict, it seems the HEAD version introduces a `Random r` field that isn't present in the commit `f52ad1d45dda2f7312098d8b51fa287f11cc1944`. Since this is an addition of a field that would likely be used elsewhere in the code, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping this new field.

```java
    Map<OperatorKey, MapReduceOper> splitsSeen;

    NodeIdGenerator nig;

    private String scope;

    private Random r;
    
    private UDFFinder udfFinder;

    private CompilationMessageCollector messageCollector = null;

    private Map<PhysicalOperator,MapReduceOper> phyToMROpMap;

```
