Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side is initializing `GruntParser` with just a `StringReader` for the script, while the other side is also passing a `myPig` object as a second parameter. Since the second version (from commit 2125666c) includes additional context by passing in the Pig instance, this appears to be an intentional enhancement to provide the parser with access to the Pig context.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "describe b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```
