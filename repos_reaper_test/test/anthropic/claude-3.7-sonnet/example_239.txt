Looking at the merge conflict, I need to determine whether to keep or remove the import for `java.lang.reflect.Method`. Based on the available context, I can see this is in an import section of a Java file in the Apache Pig project. 

Since I don't have additional context about whether this import is used elsewhere in the file, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the import as it was likely added for a purpose in the HEAD version.
