Looking at the merge conflict, I can see this is a method signature declaration for `getSplits` in a Java InputFormat implementation. The only difference between the two versions is the formatting/indentation of the method signature and the throws clause.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    /* (non-Javadoc)
     * @see org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.InputFormat#getSplits(org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.JobContext)
     */
    @SuppressWarnings({ "unchecked", "rawtypes" })
    @Override
    public List<InputSplit> getSplits(JobContext jobcontext) 
            throws IOException, InterruptedException {

        Configuration conf = jobcontext.getConfiguration();

        ArrayList<FileSpec> inputs;
        ArrayList<ArrayList<OperatorKey>> inpTargets;

```

I've chosen the formatting from the second version (from commit 1cb2531c) as it appears to follow a more standard Java style with the throws clause on a new line aligned with the method parameters.
