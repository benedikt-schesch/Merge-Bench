Looking at the merge conflict, I see that the only difference is whitespace: one version has no space before the opening curly brace (`isEqualTo(long expected){`), and the other has a space (`isEqualTo(long expected) {`).

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

  protected LongAssert(Long actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, LongAssert.class, description);
  }

  public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected) {
    longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```

I chose the version with the space before the curly brace since it's a common Java coding convention and appears to be the style used in the newer commit (the one from `61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7`).
