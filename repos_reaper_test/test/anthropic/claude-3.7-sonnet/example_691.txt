Looking at the merge conflict, I see that one side is adding a new property for specifying a delay before hiding success notifications, while the other side is removing this property. Based on the surrounding context with similar notification properties, it appears the intent of the added property is to enhance the notification system with timing control.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
	public static final Property<String> dialogTextProperty  = new StringProperty("dialogText").hint("Dialog Text").partOfBuiltInSchema();

	public static final Property<String> successNotificationsProperty        = new StringProperty("successNotifications").hint("Notifications after successful execution of action").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successNotificationsPartialProperty = new StringProperty("successNotificationsPartial").hint("CSS selector for partial to display as success notification").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> successNotificationsEventProperty   = new StringProperty("successNotificationsEvent").hint("Event to raise for success notifications").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<Integer> successNotificationsDelayProperty  = new IntProperty("successNotificationsDelay").hint("Delay before hiding success notifications").defaultValue(5000).partOfBuiltInSchema();

	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsProperty        = new StringProperty("failureNotifications").hint("Notifications after failed execution of action").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsPartialProperty = new StringProperty("failureNotificationsPartial").hint("CSS selector for partial to display as failure notification").partOfBuiltInSchema();
	public static final Property<String> failureNotificationsEventProperty   = new StringProperty("failureNotificationsEvent").hint("Event to raise for failure notifications").partOfBuiltInSchema();
