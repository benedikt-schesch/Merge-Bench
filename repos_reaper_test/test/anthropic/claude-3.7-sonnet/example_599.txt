I need to resolve a merge conflict in the Java code provided. The conflict is about the presence or absence of a `serialVersionUID` declaration in the `PageRestaurantSpecialties` class.

Let me analyze both sides:
1. HEAD version includes `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;`
2. The merged version (a17acec0) removes this line

The `serialVersionUID` is important for serializable classes to maintain version compatibility. Since this class extends `AbstractFacebookType`, which might be serializable, I'll keep the serialVersionUID for safety.

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageRestaurantSpecialties extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private Boolean breakfast;


```
