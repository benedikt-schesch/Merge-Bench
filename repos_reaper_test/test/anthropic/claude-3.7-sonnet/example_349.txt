Analyzing this merge conflict, I see that both sides are trying to achieve the same functionality: checking if the application is running as a GraalVM native image by inspecting a system property. The difference is that the right side (incoming change) is using constants for the property name and value instead of hard-coded strings.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    }

    public String toString() {
      // When running the application as a native image, append `-graalvm` to the
      // version.
      String imageCode = System.getProperty(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY);
      if (imageCode != null && imageCode.equals(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME)) {
        String[] tokens = versionString.split(" ");
        if (tokens.length > 0 && tokens[0].startsWith("gl-java")) {
          tokens[0] += "-graalvm";
          return Joiner.on(" ").join(tokens);
        }

```

I chose the incoming change (right side) because it uses named constants instead of string literals, which is generally better practice for maintainability and clarity.
