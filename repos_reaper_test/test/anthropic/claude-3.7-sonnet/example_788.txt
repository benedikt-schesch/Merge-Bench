Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine the correct resolution based on the intent and semantics of both changes.

In the HEAD version, the constructor call to `super` includes `PUT` as the first parameter, while in the d5436090 version, this parameter is missing. This suggests a change in the parent class constructor signature.

Since we're dealing with a constructor invocation for a class that's likely a subclass focusing on `PUT` operations (based on the first parameter of the HEAD version), and without more information about the parent class, I'm going to preserve the HEAD version which explicitly indicates the operation type.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                     final byte[] family,
                     final byte[][] qualifiers,
                     final byte[][] values,
                     final long timestamp,
                     final long lockid) {
    super(PUT, table, key, family, timestamp, lockid);
    KeyValue.checkFamily(family);
    if (qualifiers.length != values.length) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Have " + qualifiers.length
        + " qualifiers and " + values.length + " values.  Should be equal.");
    } else if (qualifiers.length == 0) {
```
