Looking at this merge conflict, I see that the `77ca2cb` commit is adding an additional import statement for `org.jboss.netty.channel.group.ChannelGroup` that wasn't in the HEAD version. Since this is just adding a new import that doesn't conflict with any existing code, I'll resolve it by including the new import.

```java
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.UUID;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

import org.jboss.netty.channel.Channel;
import org.jboss.netty.channel.group.ChannelGroup;

import org.spout.api.command.CommandSource;
import org.spout.api.command.CommandManager;
import org.spout.api.entity.Entity;
import org.spout.api.event.EventManager;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
```
