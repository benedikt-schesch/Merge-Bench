Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
    private PageStartDate date;
  }

  public static class PageStartDate extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private Integer year;

```

I kept the `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;` line because it's a standard practice in Java for classes that implement Serializable. The serialVersionUID is used during deserialization to verify compatibility with the class that was used for serialization. Removing it could potentially cause issues with serialization/deserialization, so it's safer to keep it.
