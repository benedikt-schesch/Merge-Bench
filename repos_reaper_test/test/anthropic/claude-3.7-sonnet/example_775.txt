I'll resolve the merge conflict by analyzing the intent of the changes. 

```java
import org.hbase.async.KeyValue;
import org.hbase.async.PutRequest;
import org.hbase.async.RowLock;
import org.hbase.async.RowLockRequest;
import org.hbase.async.Scanner;

import org.slf4j.Logger;

import org.hbase.async.test.Common;

/**
```

In this case, the HEAD version had an additional blank line after the `Scanner` import, while the other version (d543609...) removed this blank line. Since empty lines are typically used for organizational purposes and don't affect functionality, I've preserved the blank line from the HEAD version as it might have been added intentionally for readability or to separate import blocks.
