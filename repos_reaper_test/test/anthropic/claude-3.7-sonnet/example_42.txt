Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the only difference is in the formatting of the method signature. One version has the exceptions on a new line, and the other has them on the same line as the method declaration.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
   *
   * @param user Spectator to add to this game.
   * @throws TooManySpectatorsException Thrown if this game is at its maximum spectator capacity.
   * @throws IllegalStateException      Thrown if {@code user} is already in a game.
   */
  public void addSpectator(final User user) throws TooManySpectatorsException, IllegalStateException {
    logger.info(String.format("%s joined game %d as a spectator.", user.toString(), id));
    synchronized (spectators) {
      if (spectators.size() >= options.spectatorLimit) {
        throw new TooManySpectatorsException();
      }
```

I chose the format with the exceptions on the same line as it appears to be from the more recent commit (indicated by the SHA hash), and it's also a more compact representation.
