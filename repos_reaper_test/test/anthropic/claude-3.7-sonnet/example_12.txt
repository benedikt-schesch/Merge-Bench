Looking at this merge conflict, it seems both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - getting the meta plugin from the plugin manager. The difference is in how they're accessing it:

1. `HEAD` version directly calls `Spout.getPluginManager().getMetaPlugin()`
2. The other change casts the result of `Spout.getPluginManager()` to `PluginManager` before calling `getMetaPlugin()`

The change with the cast suggests the API might have changed, requiring an explicit cast to access the `getMetaPlugin()` method. Since explicit casting is typically added for a reason (likely API compatibility or type safety), I'll resolve using the newer version with the cast.

```java
	private final Map<Integer, Widget> spoutMessages = new HashMap<Integer, Widget>();
	// The hashmap that contains the plugin's debug messages
	private final Map<Plugin, Widget> messages = new HashMap<Plugin, Widget>();

	public DebugScreen() {
		plugin = ((PluginManager) Spout.getPluginManager()).getMetaPlugin();
		init();
	}

	@Override
	public void open() {

```
