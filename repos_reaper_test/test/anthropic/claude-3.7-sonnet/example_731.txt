Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine the correct way to set the rotation value for the `flinger` object.

The conflict shows:
- HEAD version is using a variable `mOrientationCompensation` plus 90 degrees
- The merged in version is using a fixed 90 degrees

Looking at semantics, the HEAD version appears to be accounting for the current device orientation through the `mOrientationCompensation` variable, which seems more dynamic and likely to handle different device orientations correctly.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
            final ThumbnailFlinger flinger = new ThumbnailFlinger(CameraActivity.this);
            mHandler.post(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    layout.addView(flinger);
                    flinger.setRotation(mOrientationCompensation+90);
                    flinger.setImageBitmap(info.mThumbnail);
                    flinger.doAnimation();
                }
            });

```
