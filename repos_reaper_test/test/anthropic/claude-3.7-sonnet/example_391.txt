Looking at the merge conflict, I can see there's a difference in import statements. Here's my resolution:

```java
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
 * SOFTWARE.
 */
package org.infinitest;

import static com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList;
import static com.google.common.collect.Sets.newHashSet;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

import java.io.File;
```

The main differences were:
1. HEAD included `Lists.newArrayList` import which wasn't in the other branch
2. HEAD used JUnit Jupiter's Assertions (`org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions`) while the other branch used JUnit 4's Assert (`org.junit.Assert`)
3. There was a line break after `java.io.File;` in HEAD

I kept all imports and went with the JUnit Jupiter version of assertions since that appears to be the modernization intent. The line break after `java.io.File;` was preserved.
