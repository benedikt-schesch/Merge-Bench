Looking at the code with the merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to send a `WorldChangeMessage` but with different parameters. One side includes a `false` parameter and uses `world.getData()` while the other doesn't have the boolean parameter and uses `world.getDatatable()`. 

Here's the resolved code with the merge conflict:

```java
		session.send(new EntityTransformMessage(player.getId(), new Transform(p, rot, Vector3.ONE), getRepositionManager()));
	}

	@Override
	protected void worldChanged(World world) {
		session.send(false, new WorldChangeMessage(world, world.getData()));
	}

	@Override
	public void updateBlock(Chunk chunk, int x, int y, int z, BlockMaterial material, short data) {
		session.send(new BlockUpdateMessage(chunk.getBlock(x, y, z)));
```

I resolved the conflict by choosing the second version because:
1. It appears to use an updated API method `world.getData()` instead of `world.getDatatable()`
2. It includes an additional `false` parameter to `session.send()` which likely indicates a specific behavior change that was intended in the newer version.
