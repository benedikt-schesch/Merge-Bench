Looking at this merge conflict, I see a duplicate section of code. The HEAD version repeats the calculation of `finalPos` and condition check that already exists in the common context. The other branch (c9237517) removes this duplication.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
        float finalPos = getTranslationY() + distance;
        if (finalPos > 0) {
            finalPos = 0;
        }

        setTranslationY(finalPos);

        if (getAlpha() == 0.0f) {
            setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
            setAlpha(1.0f);
```

The resolution removes the duplicate code since the variable assignment and condition check already exist in the shared context above the conflict.
