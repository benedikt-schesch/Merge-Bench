Looking at the merge conflict, I need to determine if the import statements for `org.spout.engine.SpoutServer` and `org.spout.engine.world.SpoutServerWorld` should be kept or removed.

Since the conflict shows these imports are present in the current branch (HEAD) but were removed in the commit being merged (67bcb76a96f358fc131320b0611ffaa3bf3678c2), I need to understand the intent. Without seeing the rest of the file, it's difficult to determine if these imports are still needed.

Given the limited context and the ambiguity about whether these imports are used elsewhere in the file, I'll preserve the conflict as is:

```java
import org.spout.nbt.StringTag;
import org.spout.nbt.stream.NBTInputStream;
import org.spout.nbt.stream.NBTOutputStream;
import org.spout.nbt.util.NBTMapper;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.spout.engine.SpoutServer;
import org.spout.engine.world.SpoutServerWorld;
