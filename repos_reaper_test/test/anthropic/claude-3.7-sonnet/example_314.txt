Here's the code snippet with the merge conflict resolved:

```java
	private static class ViewHolder {
		public ImageView profileImage;
		public TextView screenName;
		public TextView userId;
		public TextView lastStatus;
		public TextView followBtn;
		public TextView testBtn;
	}

	@Override
	public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
		View view;

```

I resolved the conflict by keeping both TextView fields since they appear to be different UI components that serve different purposes - one for following functionality and one for testing. This preserves the intent of both changes without losing functionality from either side of the merge.
