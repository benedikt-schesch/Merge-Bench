I'll resolve this merge conflict carefully, focusing on the semantic intent.

Looking at the conflict, it appears that both sides are providing a method for changing repository stars, but one uses a `ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase` class and the other a `ChangeRepositoryStarRepository` class. The method signatures and names are identical except for the return type.

Here's my resolution:

```java
    return new GenericRepository<>(null, api);
  }

  @Provides
  @PerActivity
  ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase provideChangeRepositoryStarRepository() {
    return new ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase();
  }

  @Provides
  @PerActivity

```

I resolved this by choosing the HEAD version that uses `ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase`. This seems to be the newer code since it follows a more modern naming convention (using UseCase instead of Repository for what appears to be an action). However, if the project has specific requirements about using the Repository pattern consistently, you might want to review this decision.
