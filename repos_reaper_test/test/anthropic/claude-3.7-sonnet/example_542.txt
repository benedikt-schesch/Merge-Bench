Looking at the merge conflict, it seems that both sides are declaring a `scanCallback` variable, but the left side (HEAD) also includes an `advertiseCallback` variable and describes them as "API 21+ Scan and Advertise Callbacks", while the right side just has a comment saying "Scan Callback". Since the code right after this section appears to be checking for Android Lollipop (API 21) support, the HEAD version with both callbacks makes more sense.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
        scanCallbackContext.sendPluginResult(pluginResult);
      }
    }
  };

  //API 21+ Scan and Advertise Callbacks
  private ScanCallback scanCallback = null;
  private AdvertiseCallback advertiseCallback = null;

  //TODO Is there a cleaner way to prevent this from running on KitKat
  protected void pluginInitialize() {
    if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
      return;
```
