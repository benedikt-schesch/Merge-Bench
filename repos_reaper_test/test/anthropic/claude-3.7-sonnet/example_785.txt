Looking at this merge conflict, I see that the difference is about the generic type parameter of `Deferred`. One side has it as a raw type (`Deferred`), and the other side has specified a wildcard generic parameter (`Deferred<?>`).

The best practice in Java is to use generics properly, and using a wildcard generic parameter (`Deferred<?>`) is generally better than using a raw type. This appears to be a type safety improvement.

Here's the resolved code:

```java

  /** The RPC that was failed with this exception.  */
  private final HBaseRpc rpc;

  /** A deferred one can wait on before retrying the failed RPC.  */
  private final Deferred<?> deferred;

  /**
   * Constructor.
   * @param msg A message explaining why the application has to throttle.
   * @param cause The exception that requires the application to throttle

```
