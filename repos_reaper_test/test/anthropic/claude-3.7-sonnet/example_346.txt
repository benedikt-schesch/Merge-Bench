Looking at this merge conflict, I notice that the difference is in the namespace URI of the XML Event element. One version has:
`"urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0/RCS/"` (HEAD)

While the other has:
`"urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0//RCS/"` (incoming change) with an extra slash.

After analyzing the standard URI format for UPnP metadata, I'll resolve this conflict:

```java

        assertEquals(renderingControlLastChange.toString(), "");
        mp.setVolume(0.50);
        Thread.sleep(500);
        lastChangeExpected =
                "<Event xmlns=\"urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0/RCS/\">" +
                        "<InstanceID val=\"0\">" +
                        "<Volume channel=\"Master\" val=\"50\"/>" +
                        "</InstanceID>" +
                "</Event>";
        assertEquals(renderingControlLastChange.toString(), lastChangeExpected);

```

The HEAD version has the correct URI format with a single slash between "1-0" and "RCS", which is the standard UPnP namespace format.
