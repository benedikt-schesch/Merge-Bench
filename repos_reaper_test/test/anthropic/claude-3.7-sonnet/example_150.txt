After analyzing the merge conflict, I can see that the difference is in how `GruntParser` is initialized. One side initializes it with just a `StringReader`, while the other side includes a second parameter `myPig`. The contextual intent seems to be providing the Pig instance to the parser. Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "illustrate b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```
