Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing: get the current player's display name and store it in the outState Bundle under the key "player". The difference is in how they access the current player:

1. `HEAD` uses `Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer(((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC())`
2. The other branch uses `((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC().getCurrentPlayer()`

I'll resolve this by choosing the proper approach based on what appears to be the correct API usage.

```java
	@Override
	public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
		super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
		try {
			if (((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC().isConnected())
				outState.putString("player", Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer(((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC()).getDisplayName());
			else
				outState.remove("player");
		} catch (Exception e) {
			if (Logger.LOG)
				Logger.log(e);
```

I chose the `HEAD` version because it appears to be using the standard Google Play Games API pattern where `Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer()` is the proper way to access the current player from a Google API Client.
