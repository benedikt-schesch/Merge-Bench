Based on the code snippet provided, I can see a merge conflict involving a debug timer check. The intent is to add debugging functionality to track execution time when the app is in debug mode. Here's the resolved code:

```java
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new ResponseException(e.getMessage(), e);
                }
            }
        }
        if(TwitterApplication.DEBUG){
        	DebugTimer.betweenEnd("AS STRING");
        }
        return str;
    }

    public JSONObject asJSONObject() throws ResponseException {
        try {
```

I resolved the conflict by keeping the debug timer code from the incoming change. This appears to be a performance monitoring enhancement that doesn't affect core functionality, and it's protected behind a DEBUG flag, so it will only run in debug mode.
