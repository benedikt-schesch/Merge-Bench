After analyzing the merge conflict, I can see that one branch (HEAD) includes imports for Socket-related classes and URL, while the other branch (1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81) removes these imports. Since imports are typically included only when they're needed, I'll resolve it by keeping the imports as they likely serve a purpose in the HEAD version:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.io.SequenceInputStream;
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.SocketException;
import java.net.SocketImplFactory;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Enumeration;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Iterator;
```
