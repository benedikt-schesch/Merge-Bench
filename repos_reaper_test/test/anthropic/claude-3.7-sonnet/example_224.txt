Looking at the merge conflict, I notice that the HEAD version includes a blank line, while the version from commit `1488b22ce` has removed this blank line. This is a simple whitespace conflict before a license header section. Since preserving or removing this blank line likely doesn't affect functionality, I'll resolve it by keeping the HEAD version (with the blank line) as it maintains better readability between license sections.
