Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both changes. The two sides differ in how they create a `SpoutClientWorld` object and how they access the data map. Here's my resolution:

```java
	public SpoutClientWorld getDefaultWorld() {
		return world.get();
	}

	public SpoutClientWorld worldChanged(String name, UUID uuid, byte[] data) {
		System.out.println("WORLD CHANGED!");
		SpoutClientWorld world = new SpoutClientWorld(name, uuid, this, getEngineItemMap(), getEngineItemMap());

		SerializableMap map = world.getData();
		try {
			map.deserialize(data);
		} catch (IOException e) {
			throw new RuntimeException("Unable to deserialize data", e);
		}
```

I made this resolution because:
1. The HEAD version added a debug print statement which seems intentional
2. The newer version (67bcb76) has a more complete constructor for `SpoutClientWorld` with additional parameters
3. The newer version calls `getData()` instead of `getDatatable()`, which seems to be an API change that should be preserved
