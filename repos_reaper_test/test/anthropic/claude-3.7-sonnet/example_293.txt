Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
    public boolean mustGenerateObjectId(Object pojo) {
        for (BeanPropertyDefinition def : beanDescription(pojo.getClass()).findProperties()) {
            if (idSelector.isId(def)) {
                AnnotatedMember accessor = def.getAccessor();
                accessor.fixAccess(true);
                return idSelector.isObjectId(def) && accessor.getValue(pojo) == null;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

```

I kept the version from HEAD, as it appears the method was refactored to use an `idSelector` object rather than a direct method call to `isObjectId`. This maintains the consistent use of the `idSelector` object which is also used earlier in the method in the `idSelector.isId(def)` call.
