Looking at this merge conflict, I need to resolve it carefully to ensure both sides' intent is preserved. Here, both lines are importing different Java packages that seem to be required for the code. Since these are just imports, I should include both of them.

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.Properties;
import java.util.Map;

import junit.framework.TestCase;

import org.junit.Test;
