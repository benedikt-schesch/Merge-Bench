The provided code has a merge conflict, but both sides of the conflict are identical except for indentation. The conflict is simply between two versions of the same line with different spacing.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
                    roots = rp.getRoots().toArray(new PhysicalOperator[1]);
                    leaf = rp.getLeaves().get(0);
                }

                // Get the UDF specific context
                MapRedUtil.setupUDFContext(jConf);

            } catch (IOException ioe) {
                String msg = "Problem while configuring reduce plan.";
                throw new RuntimeException(msg, ioe);
            }
```

I kept the indentation level consistent with the surrounding code (4 spaces at the beginning of the line), which aligns with the HEAD version's indentation.
