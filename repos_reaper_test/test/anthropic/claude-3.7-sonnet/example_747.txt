I'll resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intention of both versions.

```java
>>>>>>> c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c
    }

    public void notifySidebarSlideOpen() {
        FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = (FrameLayout.LayoutParams) getLayoutParams();
        animate().translationX(params.leftMargin).setDuration(
                SideBar.SLIDE_ANIMATION_DURATION_MS).start();
    }

    public void hideWidgets() {
        mIsHidden = true;

```

The only difference is the line formatting - the HEAD version has the entire animation definition on one line, while the incoming change (c923751) has split the method call to put the parameter on its own line. I've chosen the multi-line formatting version as it improves readability for longer lines of code.
