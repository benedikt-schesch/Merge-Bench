I'll resolve the merge conflict in the provided Java code. Looking at the conflict, one side includes the assertion `assertTrue(comments.getCanComment());` while the other side has removed this line. Let me provide the resolved code:

```java

    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getComments());
    Comments comments = exampleRating.getComments();
    assertEquals("chronological", comments.getOrder());
    assertEquals(1L, comments.getTotalCount().longValue());
    assertTrue(comments.getCanComment());

    assertNotNull(exampleRating.getLikes());
    Likes likes = exampleRating.getLikes();
    assertEquals(0L, likes.getTotalCount().longValue());
    assertTrue(likes.getCanLike());

```

I chose to keep the assertion `assertTrue(comments.getCanComment());` since it appears to be testing a feature (the ability to comment) that pairs with the similar assertion below for likes (`assertTrue(likes.getCanLike());`). Maintaining this assertion makes the test more thorough and consistent.
