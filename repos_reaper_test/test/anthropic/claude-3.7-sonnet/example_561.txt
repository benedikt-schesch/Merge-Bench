Looking at the merge conflict, I see two equivalent testing approaches for the same assertions. One side uses AssertJ's `assertThat().isEqualTo()` style, while the other uses JUnit's `assertEquals()` style. Both are testing the same values and functionality, just with different assertion libraries.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_withCursor() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = createCursorConnection();
    assertThat(connection.getAfterCursor()).isEqualTo("NzU1MjI1MjU0");
    assertThat(connection.getBeforeCursor()).isEqualTo("MTY1MTAyNjUxNg==");
  }

  private Connection<FacebookType> createCursorConnection() {
    FakeWebRequestor fakeWebRequestor = new FakeWebRequestor() {
      @Override

```

I've chosen to keep the AssertJ style (`assertThat().isEqualTo()`) as it appears to be the newer style in the HEAD branch, which often indicates the preferred assertion style in the codebase moving forward.
