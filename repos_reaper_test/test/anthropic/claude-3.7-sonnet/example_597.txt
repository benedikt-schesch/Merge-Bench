Based on the merge conflict, it appears that one branch adds an import for `com.restfb.json.Json` while the other branch removes it. Since the `JsonObject` import from the same package is still present after the conflict, and there's no way to determine if the `Json` class is actually used in the code without seeing more context, I'll resolve this conservatively by keeping the import.

```java
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;

import com.restfb.Facebook;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper.JsonMappingCompleted;
import com.restfb.json.Json;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
import com.restfb.types.ads.Business;
import com.restfb.util.DateUtils;

import java.util.ArrayList;
```
