Here's the resolved code snippet, preserving the context:

```java
     * <pre>UdfContext.getUdfContext().getJobConf()</pre>
     */
    @Deprecated
    public static Configuration sJobConf = null;

    public static final ThreadLocal<Configuration> sJobConfInternal = new ThreadLocal<Configuration>();

    public static class Map extends PigMapBase {

        @Override
        public void collect(Context oc, Tuple tuple)
```

I resolved the conflict by choosing the version that makes `sJobConfInternal` final. This is likely the right choice because making a variable final is more restrictive and represents an improvement in code quality by ensuring the reference cannot be reassigned. The addition of `final` doesn't change the functionality but improves type safety.
