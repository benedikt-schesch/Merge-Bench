Looking at both sides of the merge conflict, it seems both versions are trying to verify that after reaching the third and last page, there are no more elements, and attempting to access the next element should throw a `NoSuchElementException`. The main difference is in the assertion style:

1. HEAD version uses AssertJ style assertions (`assertThat` and `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown`)
2. The other version uses JUnit style assertions (`assertFalse` and `fail`)

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
    ConnectionIterator<FacebookType> it = connection.iterator();
    it.next(); // first page
    it.next(); // second page
    it.next(); // third and last page

    assertThat(it.hasNext()).isFalse();
    it.next();
    failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(NoSuchElementException.class);
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_withCursor() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = createCursorConnection();

```

I chose the HEAD version with the AssertJ style assertions since it appears the codebase is using AssertJ and it's also more readable and expressive for exception expectations.
