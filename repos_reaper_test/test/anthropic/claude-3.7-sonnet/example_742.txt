Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are setting the same minimum height for the widget container, but they have slightly different formatting:

1. HEAD version has the code on a single line.
2. The other version (c923751783db11df8cb8dc1909ab59605492344c) splits the line by breaking after the opening parenthesis.

Since the actual functionality is identical and this is just a formatting difference, I'll resolve the conflict by selecting one version. I'll choose the more readable multi-line version:

```java

        private void initialize() {
            // Set padding
            int pad = getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.widget_container_padding) * 2;
            this.setPadding(pad, pad, pad, pad);
            this.setMinimumHeight(getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(
                    R.dimen.widget_option_button_size) * 3);
        }

        @Override
        public void onFinishInflate() {
            super.onFinishInflate();

```
