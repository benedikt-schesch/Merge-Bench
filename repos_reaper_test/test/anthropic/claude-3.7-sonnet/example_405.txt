Looking at the conflict, both sides are setting the `account.setSummary` with a player name, but they use different approaches to retrieve the current player. 

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
		// change for example), then the fragment's onCreate is called before
		// the new GamesClient is setup. In this case, just use the player name
		// saved in the savedInstanceState bundle
		if ((savedInstanceState == null && ((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC().isConnected())
				|| (savedInstanceState != null && savedInstanceState.containsKey("player"))) {
			account.setSummary(getString(
					R.string.signed_in,
					savedInstanceState == null ? ((MainActivity) getActivity()).getGC()
							.getCurrentPlayer().getDisplayName() : savedInstanceState
							.getString("player")));
		}

		final SharedPreferences prefs = getActivity().getSharedPreferences("pedometer",
				Context.MODE_MULTI_PROCESS);

```

I chose the second implementation because it appears to be accessing the current player directly through a method on the GamesClient (`getGC().getCurrentPlayer()`) rather than calling the static `Games.Players.getCurrentPlayer()` API. The second approach is likely more aligned with updated API usage patterns and follows a more direct access to the player information.
