Looking at the merge conflict, I need to decide whether to include the import for `PigNullableWritable`. Since this is just an import statement and doesn't affect the actual functionality of the code, it's generally safer to include additional imports that might be used. The merge conflict is adding this import in the branch being merged in, which suggests it's needed for new functionality.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
import org.apache.pig.data.DataBag;
import org.apache.pig.data.InternalCachedBag;
import org.apache.pig.data.NonSpillableDataBag;
import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;
import org.apache.pig.impl.io.NullableTuple;
import org.apache.pig.impl.io.PigNullableWritable;
import org.apache.pig.impl.util.Pair;
/**
 * The package operator that packages the globally rearranged tuples into
 * output format after the combiner stage.  It differs from POPackage in that
 * it does not use the index in the NullableTuple to find the bag to put a
