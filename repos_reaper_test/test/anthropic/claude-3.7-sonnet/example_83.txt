Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to declare and initialize a `List<String>` variable named `strs`. The only difference is whether they use `textParts.size()` or `textParts.length()` to determine the initial capacity.

Since `textParts` is a `JSONArray`, the correct method to use is `length()` which is the method provided by JSONArray to get its size, not `size()`.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
  private CustomCardFormatHelper() {
  }

  public static String formatBlackCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // TODO this is going to need some work to look pretty.
    final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());
    for (final Object o : textParts) {
      strs.add((String) o);
    }
    final String text = StringUtils.join(strs, "____");
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml11(text);

```
