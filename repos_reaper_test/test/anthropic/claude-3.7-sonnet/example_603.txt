Based on the code snippet, it looks like there's a merge conflict regarding how to retrieve data from `rawPicture`. Let me analyze the intent and resolve this conflict.

Looking at the two versions:
1. `rawPicture.get("data").toString()` - accessing data using a simple `get` method
2. `rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString()` - accessing data with `getJsonObject` which suggests a more type-safe approach

The second approach from the incoming change is using a more specific method that seems designed for JSON objects, which is likely more appropriate if `rawPicture` is a JSON structure. This is a common pattern when working with JSON APIs to ensure the right type of value is retrieved.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    picture = null;

    if (rawPicture == null)
      return;

    String picJson = rawPicture.getJsonObject("data").toString();
    picture = jsonMapper.toJavaObject(picJson, ProfilePictureSource.class);
  }

  @JsonMappingCompleted
