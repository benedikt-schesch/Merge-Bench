Looking at this merge conflict, it seems like the code is modifying which texture is being loaded by the texture manager. The change is from `mBitmapTexture` to `mBitmapTextureAtlas`, which indicates a change in the texture object being used in the code (likely as part of a refactoring or feature change).

Here's the resolved code:

```java
					ModPlayerExample.this.startPlayingMod();
				}
			});
		}

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```

I've chosen the newer version (`mBitmapTextureAtlas`) from the second branch as it appears to be an intentional update to the texture management system, likely changing from a simple texture to a texture atlas which is a more optimized approach for handling multiple textures.
