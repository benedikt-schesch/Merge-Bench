Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine which approach is better based on the semantic intent. Here we have a method signature being changed in two different ways:

1. One side changes the parameter from using a message ID (`rpcid`) as an `int`.
2. The other side changes the parameter to use the full `HBaseRpc` object.

Since the method takes a `ChannelBuffer` and seems to deserialize an RPC response, having access to the full `HBaseRpc` object likely provides more context than just the ID. Looking at the function body that follows, there's nothing that immediately requires the `rpcid`, but the full RPC object would provide more information if needed.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
   * @param buf The buffer from which to de-serialize the response.
   * @param rpc The RPC for which we're de-serializing the response.
   * @return The de-serialized RPC response (which can be {@code null}
   * or an exception).
   */
  private Object deserialize(final ChannelBuffer buf, final HBaseRpc rpc) {
    // The 1st byte of the payload contains flags:
    //   0x00  Old style success (prior 0.92).
    //   0x01  RPC failed with an exception.
    //   0x02  New style success (0.92 and above).
    final byte flags = buf.readByte();
```
