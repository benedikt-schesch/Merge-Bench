Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java

  /**
   * Specifies a particular column qualifier to scan.
   * <p>
   * Note that specifying a qualifier without a family has no effect.
   * You need to call {@link #setFamily(byte[])} too.
   * @param qualifier The column qualifier.
   * <strong>This byte array will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @throws IllegalStateException if scanning already started.
   */
  public void setQualifier(final byte[] qualifier) {

```

I've resolved the merge conflict by keeping both the original text and the additional note from the incoming change that clarifies the API usage requirements. This clarification helps developers understand that they need to call `setFamily()` in addition to `setQualifier()` for the qualifier to have an effect.
