Looking at the merge conflict, I see that:

1. The HEAD version directly compiles the logical plan using `HExecutionEngine`
2. The incoming change (`d95d3beb`) adds an optimization step before compilation and uses `MRExecutionEngine` instead

This appears to be a change in execution engines, with an added optimization step. I'll resolve it by preserving both the optimization step and using what appears to be the newer execution engine type.

```java
    }

    public static PhysicalPlan buildPp(PigServer pigServer, String query)
    throws Exception {
        LogicalPlan lp = buildLp( pigServer, query );
        lp.optimize(pigServer.getPigContext());
        return ((HExecutionEngine)pigServer.getPigContext().getExecutionEngine()).compile(lp,
                pigServer.getPigContext().getProperties());
    }

    public static LogicalPlan parse(String query, PigContext pc) throws FrontendException {
        Map<String, String> fileNameMap = new HashMap<String, String>();

```
