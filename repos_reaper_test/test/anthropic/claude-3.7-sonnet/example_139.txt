Looking at this merge conflict, it appears the only change is the addition of the `@Private` annotation to the `setBackendException` method. The HEAD version doesn't have this annotation, while the incoming change from commit f6a8f7aa42cae344f71cc6759f1c7880b49211fc adds it.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
        public int compare(JobStats o1, JobStats o2) {
            return o1.getJobId().compareTo(o2.getJobId());
        }
    }

    @Private
    public void setBackendException(String jobId, Exception e) {
        if (e instanceof PigException) {
            LOG.error("ERROR " + ((PigException)e).getErrorCode() + ": "
                    + e.getLocalizedMessage());
        } else if (e != null) {

```
