Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the only difference is the formatting of the conditional statement - one version has the condition on a single line, while the other splits it across two lines for better readability. The actual logic is identical in both cases.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
                continue;
            }

            if (widget.getY() < tested.getFinalY() + tested.getMeasuredHeight()) {
                // Don't try to go before the first if we're already it
                if (isFirst && widget.getY() + widget.getHeight() < tested.getFinalY()
                        - tested.getHeight() / 2)
                    break;

                // Move the widget in our list
                mOpenWidgets.remove(widget);
                mOpenWidgets.add(i, widget);
```

I chose the formatting from the incoming change (the one with the line break) as it appears to be deliberately formatted for better readability, while preserving the exact same logic.
