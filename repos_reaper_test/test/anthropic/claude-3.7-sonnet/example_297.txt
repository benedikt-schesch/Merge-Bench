Looking at this merge conflict, I see that the incoming changes (from commit 57753d9b342ba712f40b3f2104b413c9720961fc) are adding import statements for `com.mongodb.LazyDBObject` and `org.bson.LazyBSONCallback`, which are likely needed for the `LazyBsonDocument` class implementation. Since there are no conflicting imports on the HEAD side, I'll merge in these additional imports.

```java
 */

package org.jongo.bson;

import com.mongodb.DBObject;
import com.mongodb.LazyDBObject;
import org.bson.LazyBSONCallback;

import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.ByteOrder;

class LazyBsonDocument implements BsonDocument {
