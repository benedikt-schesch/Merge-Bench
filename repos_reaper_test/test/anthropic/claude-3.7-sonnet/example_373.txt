Looking at this merge conflict, it seems one side is adding the `@Beta` annotation to the `isMtls()` method while the other side is removing it. I'll resolve this by preserving the annotation since removing it might break compatibility for users who are aware of its beta status.

```java
  public boolean supportsMethod(String method) {
    return Arrays.binarySearch(SUPPORTED_METHODS, method) >= 0;
  }

  @Override
  @Beta
  public boolean isMtls() {
    return this.isMtls;
  }

  @Override

```
