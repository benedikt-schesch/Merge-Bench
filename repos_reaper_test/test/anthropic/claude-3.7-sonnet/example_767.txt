Looking at this merge conflict, the newer version uses `kv.serialize` and adds tracking of `nbytes_per_family`, while the old version uses `KeyValue.serialize` with explicit parameters. Both are trying to serialize the key-value pairs, but the new implementation seems more efficient and adds byte size tracking.

Here's the resolved version:

```java
        // Total number of bytes taken by those "KeyValues".
        buf.writeInt(0);  // We'll monkey patch this later.
      }
      nkeys_per_family++;

      final KeyValue kv = edit.kv();
      nbytes_per_family += kv.predictSerializedSize();
      kv.serialize(buf, KeyValue.PUT);
      prev = edit;
    }  // Yay, we made it!

    // Monkey-patch everything for the last set of edits.
    buf.setInt(nkeys_per_family_index, nkeys_per_family);
```
