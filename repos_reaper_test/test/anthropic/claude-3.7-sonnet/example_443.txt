Based on the merge conflict, I'll resolve it carefully considering the semantics and intent:

```java
import android.graphics.Point;
import android.util.AttributeSet;
import android.util.Log;
import android.view.*;
import android.view.GestureDetector.OnGestureListener;
import android.widget.Scroller;
import com.sigseg.android.view.InputStreamScene;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
```

I resolved the conflict by removing the explicit individual imports because:
1. `android.view.*` is already imported, which includes `MotionEvent`, `SurfaceHolder`, and `SurfaceView`
2. The DELETE side of the merge (7b3abc7) removed these redundant imports
3. Keeping redundant imports doesn't change functionality but makes the code less clean
