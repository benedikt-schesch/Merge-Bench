Looking at the merge conflict, one side is adding a new test method `emptyFacebookMap()` while the other side is removing it. The context suggests this is a testing file that contains various JSON serialization tests.

Since the removed method appears to test a valid use case (empty Facebook map objects) and has a complete implementation, I'll resolve by keeping the method as it likely adds test coverage. The intent seems to be to ensure that MapObject serialization works correctly.

```java
    ListObject obj = new ListObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }

  @Test
  public void emptyFacebookMap() {
    MapObject obj = new MapObject();
    String json = createJsonMapper().toJson(obj, true);
    assertThat(json).isEqualTo("{\"id\":12345}");
  }

  /**
   * Can we handle the empty object?
   */
  @Test
  public void emptyObject() {

```
