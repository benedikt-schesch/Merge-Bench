Looking at this merge conflict, it seems the change is related to the type of a texture variable. On one side it's `BitmapTexture` and on the other side it's `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Since this is a type change that likely reflects an API update or version change, I'll resolve in favor of the newer implementation.

```java
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private Scene mScene;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mOnScreenControlTexture;
	private TextureRegion mOnScreenControlBaseTextureRegion;
	private TextureRegion mOnScreenControlKnobTextureRegion;

	private boolean mPlaceOnScreenControlsAtDifferentVerticalLocations = false;

```
