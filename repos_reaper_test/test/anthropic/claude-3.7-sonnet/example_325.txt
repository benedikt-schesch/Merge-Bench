Looking at the merge conflict, it appears one side (HEAD) removed a blank line, while the other side (d71053b45a...) has a blank line between the initialization of `myGestureListener` and the line that sets the touch listener.

Since this is just a whitespace difference that doesn't affect functionality, I'll resolve it by choosing the version without the extra blank line:

```java
    // use it in _onCreate
    private void registerGestureListener() {
        if (useGestrue) {
            myGestureListener = new FlingGestureListener(this,
                    MyActivityFlipper.create(this));
            getTweetList().setOnTouchListener(myGestureListener);
        }
    }

}
```
