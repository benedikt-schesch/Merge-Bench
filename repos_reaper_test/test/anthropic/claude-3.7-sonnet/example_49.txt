Looking at this merge conflict, I'll analyze what each side is trying to achieve:

1. The HEAD version uses `players.toArray(new Player[players.size()])` and explicitly specifies the generic type in the ArrayList constructor.
2. The incoming change uses `players.toArray(new Player[0])` which is a more modern approach, and uses the diamond operator `<>` for the ArrayList, which is also a more modern Java syntax.

Both are functionally equivalent, but the incoming change represents more modern Java practices. The intent is the same - to create an array copy of the players collection and initialize an ArrayList of appropriate size.

Here's the resolved version:

```java
   *
   * @return Player information for every player in this game: Name, score, status.
   */
  public List<Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object>> getAllPlayerInfo() {
    final List<Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object>> info;
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    info = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      final Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object> playerInfo = getPlayerInfo(player);
      info.add(playerInfo);
    }
    return info;
```
