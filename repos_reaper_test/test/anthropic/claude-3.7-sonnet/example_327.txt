Looking at the merge conflict, both sides are essentially doing the same thing - cloning the users list and assigning it to mUsers. The only difference is spacing around the cast operator.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
				});
		return view;
	}

	public void refresh(ArrayList<User> users) {
		mUsers = (ArrayList<User>) users.clone();
		notifyDataSetChanged();
	}

	@Override
	public void refresh() {

```

I chose the version with spacing around the cast operator `(ArrayList<User>)` as it's generally considered more readable and consistent with typical Java style guides.
