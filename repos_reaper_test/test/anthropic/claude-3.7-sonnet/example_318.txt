It seems the merge conflict is about which constant to use for the `mFavorited` column index. Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
			mSourceColumn = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_SOURCE);
			mInReplyToScreenName = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_IN_REPLY_TO_SCREEN_NAME);
			mFavorited = cursor
					.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED);
		}
		mMetaBuilder = new StringBuilder();
	}

	private LayoutInflater mInflater;

```

I resolved the conflict by choosing the newer version that uses `StatusTable.FIELD_FAVORITED` instead of `TwitterDbAdapter.KEY_FAVORITED`. This is consistent with the pattern used in the previous lines where `StatusTable.FIELD_*` constants are being used.
