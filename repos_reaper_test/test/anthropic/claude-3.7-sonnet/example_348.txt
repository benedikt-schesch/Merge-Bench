Looking at the merge conflict, I see two versions of the `subscribe` method. The HEAD version includes a `synchronized` modifier and a logging statement, while the other version does not have these additions.

Here's the resolved snippet with the merged code:

```java
		} catch (WifiStateException e1) {
			mInfo = null;
		}
		mSubscribers = new HashSet<Handler>();
	}

	public synchronized void subscribe(Handler handler) {
		Log.i("NowPlayingPoller", "Subscribing handler " + handler.getClass().getName() + " to now playing events.");
		// update handler on the state of affairs
		final ICurrentlyPlaying currPlaying = mControl.getCurrentlyPlaying(mManagerStub);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_PROGRESS_CHANGED, currPlaying);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_PLAYLIST_ITEM_CHANGED, currPlaying);
		sendSingleMessage(handler, MESSAGE_COVER_CHANGED, currPlaying);
```

I've kept the `synchronized` modifier and the logging statement from HEAD as these are likely to be important for thread safety and debugging without affecting the core functionality of the method.
