Looking at this merge conflict, I see a few key differences:

1. Method accessibility: `void` vs `public void` for the test method
2. Method name typo: `prepateCore` vs `prepareCore` (the second looks correct)

Here's my resolution, maintaining the surrounding context and formatting:

```java
		assertStatusIs(noTestsRun());
		verify(coreRegistry).addCore(eq(projectAUri), any(InfinitestCore.class));
	}

	@Test
	public void shouldFireAnEvent() throws CoreException {
		InfinitestCore core = prepareCore(projectAUri(), 10);

		workspace.addUpdateListeners(new UpdateListener() {
			@Override
			public void projectsUpdated() {
				updates++;

```

I chose `public void` and `prepareCore` as they align with standard JUnit conventions and fix what appears to be a typo in the method name.
