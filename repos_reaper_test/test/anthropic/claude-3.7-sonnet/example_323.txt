Looking at the merge conflict, both sides are making a notification call with a few differences:

1. Side HEAD uses `R.drawable.notify_mentions` while side f977f63c uses `R.drawable.notify_mention` (singular vs plural)
2. Side HEAD passes `latestTweet.text` directly, while side f977f63c processes it through `Utils.getSimpleTweetText(latestTweet.text)`

Since the f977f63c change seems to be processing the tweet text with a utility method to simplify it (likely removing formatting or unnecessary elements), this appears to be an intentional improvement. The notification icon change (to singular) is also likely intentional.

```java
		}

		PendingIntent intent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0,
				MentionActivity.createIntent(this), 0);

		notify(intent, MENTION_NOTIFICATION_ID, R.drawable.notify_mention,
				Utils.getSimpleTweetText(latestTweet.text), title, text);
	}

	private static int TWEET_NOTIFICATION_ID = 0;
	private static int DM_NOTIFICATION_ID = 1;
	private static int MENTION_NOTIFICATION_ID = 2;

```
