Looking at the merge conflict, one side is using `mBitmapTexture` of type `BitmapTexture`, while the other side is using `mBitmapTextureAtlas` of type `BitmapTextureAtlas`. This appears to be a change in the type of texture object being used. Since the newer commit (91801fdd...) is using `BitmapTextureAtlas`, I'll resolve in favor of that change, as it likely represents an update or improvement to the texture handling system.

```java

	// ===========================================================
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;

	private TiledTextureRegion mBoxFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mCircleFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mTriangleFaceTextureRegion;
	private TiledTextureRegion mHexagonFaceTextureRegion;

```
