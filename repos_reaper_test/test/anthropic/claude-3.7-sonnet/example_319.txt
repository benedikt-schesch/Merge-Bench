Looking at the merge conflict, I see that one side has no code, while the other side is adding debug timing functionality. The conflict is quite straightforward - the debug code is additive and doesn't contradict any functionality in the HEAD version.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
        mResponse = null;
        return is;
    }

    public String asString() throws ResponseException {
    	if (TwitterApplication.DEBUG){
    		DebugTimer.betweenStart("AS STRING");
    	}

        String str = null;
        InputStream is = asStream();
        if (null == is) {
            return str;
```
