Looking at this merge conflict, it's clear that there's a discrepancy in the `newView` method implementation. The HEAD version sets up a ViewHolder pattern for view recycling, while the incoming change (3cac0b6) has a commented FIXME section related to cursor column access.

Based on the context, these appear to be different concerns that could potentially both be needed. However, the incoming change has an unbalanced closing brace which suggests it might not be a complete replacement. Given the structural issues in the incoming change and the context, I'll preserve both intents.

```java
		@Override
		public View newView(Context context, Cursor cursor, ViewGroup parent) {
			View view = mInflater
					.inflate(R.layout.dropdown_item, parent, false);

			ViewHolder holder = new ViewHolder();
			holder.userText = (TextView) view.findViewById(android.R.id.text1);
			view.setTag(holder);
			
	        //FIXME:
//	        mUserTextColumn = cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(StatusTable.FIELD_USER_SCREEN_NAME);

			return view;
		}

		class ViewHolder {
```
