I'll resolve the merge conflict for this snippet. In this case, I notice that there's an empty line in the HEAD version, while the other version (1488b22c) doesn't have this empty line. Looking at the context, both versions have the same license text. The difference is just whether there's a blank line between the end of one license comment block and the beginning of another license comment block.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

I've preserved the empty line from the HEAD version, as it improves readability between the two different license comment blocks and doesn't affect functionality.
