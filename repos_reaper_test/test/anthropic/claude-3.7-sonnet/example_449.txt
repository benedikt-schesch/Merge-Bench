Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

	@Test
	public void parseUrlCode() throws Exception {
		Object scheme = createParser().parse("http://www.github.org/QRCode");
		assertNotNull(scheme);
		assertThat(scheme, instanceOf(Url.class));
		Url urlCode = (Url) scheme;
		assertEquals("http://www.github.org/QRCode", urlCode.getUrl());
	}

	@Test(expected = UnsupportedEncodingException.class)

```

I resolved the conflict by choosing the version with the space after the comma in `assertThat(scheme, instanceOf(Url.class))` as this follows standard Java formatting conventions, where commas are typically followed by a space.
