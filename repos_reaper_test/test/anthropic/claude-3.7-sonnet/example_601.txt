Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to convert a `value` string into a `JsonObject`, but they are using different approaches:

1. The HEAD version uses `Json.parse(value).asObject()`, which likely parses the string as JSON and then converts it to a JsonObject.
2. The incoming change is trying to directly construct a new JsonObject from the `value` string using `new JsonObject(value)`.

Without knowing the exact implementation details of the JsonObject constructor or the Json parsing utilities used, it's difficult to determine which approach is correct. However, typically parsing and then converting is a more explicit approach than direct construction, which might involve implicit parsing.

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
     * May throw a JsonException
     * 
     * @return
     */
    public JsonObject getValueAsJsonObject() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      return Json.parse(value).asObject();
=======
      return new JsonObject(value);
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe
    }
  }
