Looking at this merge conflict, I notice there appears to be redundant code. The HEAD version includes two separate but similar conditional blocks checking for `maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength`, with very similar warning messages. The other branch (790b69a) has removed one of these redundant checks.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                        
                        if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength) {
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                            }      
                            builder.append(url);
                        } else {

                            /*
                             * Determine what to do. Eventually, you should be able to
```

The resolution removes the redundant conditional block as it appears the second version was checking the exact same condition but with a slightly different message. The intent was clearly to avoid including URIs that exceed the maximum length, which is handled by the first condition.
