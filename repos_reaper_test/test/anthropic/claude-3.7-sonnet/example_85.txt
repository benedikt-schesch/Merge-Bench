Looking at this merge conflict, it appears that the file has been renamed and moved from `CardcastDeck.java` to `CustomDeck.java`, and the class types for the card sets have been changed from `CardcastBlackCard/CardcastWhiteCard` to `CustomBlackCard/CustomWhiteCard`. This seems to be part of a refactoring from a more specific implementation (Cardcast) to a more generic one (Custom).

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
public class CustomDeck extends CardSet {
  private final int id;
  private final String name;
  private final String watermark;
  private final String description;
  private final Set<CustomBlackCard> blackCards = new HashSet<>();
  private final Set<CustomWhiteCard> whiteCards = new HashSet<>();

  public CustomDeck(final int id, final String name, final String watermark, final String description) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.watermark = watermark;
```
