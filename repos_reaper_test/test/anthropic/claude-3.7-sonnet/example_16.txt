Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version is adding imports for `Component` and `CameraComponent` classes, while the other branch (67bcb76a) has removed these imports. To resolve this conflict, I need to consider the semantic intent.

Since imports are generally included because they're needed by code elsewhere in the file, I'll keep the imports from the HEAD version, as removing them might cause compilation errors if they're used in the file.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
 */
package org.spout.engine.entity;

import org.spout.api.Client;
import org.spout.api.Engine;
import org.spout.api.component.Component;
import org.spout.api.component.entity.CameraComponent;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Transform;
import org.spout.engine.gui.SpoutScreenStack;
import org.spout.engine.protocol.SpoutSession;
