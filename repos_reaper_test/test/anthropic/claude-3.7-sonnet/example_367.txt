Looking at this merge conflict, it seems the version from the branch `f1253614bee81db4cd5344faaa5c73a5c51b2c5b` is introducing an `addHeader` method that doesn't exist in the main branch's code. Since this is implementing interface methods for a mock HTTP request, it makes sense to include the additional method for adding headers.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
  public MockLowLevelHttpRequest(String url) {
    this.url = url;
  }

  @Override
  public void addHeader(String name, String value) {
    headers.put(name, value);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpResponse execute() throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpResponse();
  }

  @Override

```
