Looking at this merge conflict, I see that both sides are checking for invalid arguments, but the right side (c92375...) has braces around the `throw` statement while the left side (HEAD) doesn't. After that, the right side has an additional `ratio = 1 / ratio;` line which is also present in the common code after the conflict.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
        super(context, attrs);
        setAspectRatio(4.0 / 3.0);
    }

    public void setAspectRatio(double ratio) {
        if (ratio <= 0.0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }

        ratio = 1 / ratio;

        if (mAspectRatio != ratio) {
            mAspectRatio = ratio;
```

I chose the right side's braced syntax for the conditional, as it follows better coding practices. I kept only one instance of the `ratio = 1 / ratio;` line since duplicating it would be incorrect.
