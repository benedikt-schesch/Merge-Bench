Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine the intent of both changes:

- The parent version (HEAD) adds a line to create a `PigContext` with `ExecType.LOCAL` and empty `Properties`
- The incoming change (1488b22) removes this line

The issue is that after the merge, there's a reference to `pigContext` which is used as a parameter to the `LogicalPlanBuilder` constructor. If we remove the line that creates `pigContext`, this would cause a compilation error since the variable wouldn't be defined.

Since the `pigContext` variable is needed by the subsequent code, the most semantically correct resolution is to keep the line that creates the `PigContext`.

```java
        return buildPlan(query, LogicalPlanBuilder.class.getClassLoader());
    }

    public LogicalPlan buildPlan(String query, ClassLoader cldr) {
        LogicalPlanBuilder.classloader = cldr;
        PigContext pigContext = new PigContext(ExecType.LOCAL, new Properties());
        LogicalPlanBuilder builder = new LogicalPlanBuilder(pigContext); //

        try {
            LogicalPlan lp = builder.parse("Test-Plan-Builder",
                                           query,
```
