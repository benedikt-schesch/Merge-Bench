Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
 *
 */
public class POStore extends PhysicalOperator {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private static Result empty = new Result(POStatus.STATUS_NULL, null);
    transient private StoreFuncInterface storer;
    transient private POStoreImpl impl;
    transient private String counterName = null;
    private FileSpec sFile;
    private Schema schema;

```

I resolved the conflict by choosing the `private` access modifier (from the incoming change) over `protected`. The private access modifier is more restrictive and appears to be the intent of the newer version, suggesting that this static field should not be accessed outside this class.
