Looking at this merge conflict, it appears that one branch is importing `java.io.BufferedInputStream` while the other is importing `java.io.BufferedReader`. Since these are two different classes serving different purposes (one for binary data, one for character data), and I don't have enough context about which one is needed in this file, I should preserve both imports as they may both be required by the code.
