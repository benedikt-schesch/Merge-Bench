Looking at this merge conflict, it appears that one side (HEAD) has added a serialVersionUID declaration, which is a standard practice for serializable classes in Java to ensure version compatibility. The other side (a17acec0) doesn't include this declaration.

Since this is a class that extends AbstractFacebookType (which might be serializable), it's typically better to include a serialVersionUID to ensure proper serialization/deserialization across different versions. I'll resolve the conflict by keeping this field:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageStartInfo extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String type;


```
