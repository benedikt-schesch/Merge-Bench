Looking at the merge conflict, it appears one side is using `BitmapTexture` while the other side is using `BitmapTextureAtlas`. This is likely a class name change or an update to a newer API version. Based on the context, the code is initializing a texture for a font, and both sides are trying to create a bitmap texture with the same parameters.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
	}

	@Override
	public void onLoadResources() {
		/* Load Font/Textures. */
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);

		FontFactory.setAssetBasePath("font/");
		this.mFont = FontFactory.createFromAsset(this.mFontTexture, this, "Plok.ttf", 48, true, Color.WHITE);
		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mFontTexture);
		this.mEngine.getFontManager().loadFont(this.mFont);
```

I chose the `BitmapTextureAtlas` implementation because it appears to be from a newer commit (as indicated by the hash in the merge conflict), suggesting it's the updated version of the API.
