Based on my analysis, both sides of the merge conflict are identical - they're both showing a closing curly brace for the class. There's no semantic difference to resolve here, so I'll simply include one closing brace.

```java
  }

  public void removeMessageTag(MessageTag messageTag) {
    messageTags.remove(messageTag);
  }
}
```
