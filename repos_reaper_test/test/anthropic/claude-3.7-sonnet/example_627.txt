Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that it's about importing different assertion libraries - one side is using AssertJ while the other is using JUnit's Assert. Given that the context shows subsequent imports including `AssertJson` from test utilities, I'll resolve this by including both assertion imports as they serve different purposes and don't conflict with each other.
