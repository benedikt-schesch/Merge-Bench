Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine the correct return type for `GFAny`. The two options are:
- `EvalFunc<DataAtom>` (from HEAD)
- `EvalFunc<Integer>` (from the other branch)

Since this appears to be a grouping function as mentioned in the javadoc comment, and without more context about the implementation logic and usage, I can't confidently select one return type over the other. Both could be valid depending on the expected behavior of this class.

```java


/**
 * built-in grouping function; permits system to choose any grouping.
 */
<<<<<<< HEAD
public class GFAny extends EvalFunc<DataAtom> {
=======
public class GFAny extends EvalFunc<Integer> {
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    public static final int defaultNumGroups = 1000;
    
    int numGroups = defaultNumGroups;
    Random r = new Random();
    

```
