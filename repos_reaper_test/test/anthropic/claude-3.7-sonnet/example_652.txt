Based on the merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) is adding getter and setter annotations for a field called `canComment`, while the other side (commit a17acec0) is removing these annotations.

Looking at the context, I notice that there are fields `openGraphCommentOrder` and `openGraphCanComment` below, which suggests that the `canComment` field might be redundant or being replaced by these `openGraph` prefixed fields.

The resolution would be:

```java
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  private String order;

  @Facebook("comment_order")
  private String openGraphCommentOrder;

  @Facebook("can_comment")
  private Boolean openGraphCanComment;

```

I've removed the `canComment` field and its annotations as it appears the intent is to use the `openGraphCanComment` field instead.
