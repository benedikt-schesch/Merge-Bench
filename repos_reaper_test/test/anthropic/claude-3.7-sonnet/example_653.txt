Based on the merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has no method documentation for `getData()`, while the other side (`a17acec0`) has an odd structure with a `@see java.lang.Object#hashCode()` documentation before the actual method documentation.

Looking at the semantics, it appears that the conflict is about documentation, and the proper documentation for this method is "The comments. @return The comments." The `@see` reference to `hashCode()` seems out of place for a method that returns comments.

Here's my resolution:

```java
  private List<Comment> data = new ArrayList<Comment>();

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  /**
   * The comments.
   *
   * @return The comments.
   */
  public List<Comment> getData() {

```

I've removed the `@see` reference since it doesn't seem semantically related to a method that returns comments data. The rest of the documentation is kept intact as it properly describes the method's purpose.
