Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that the main branch (`HEAD`) doesn't have any additional methods, while the incoming change from commit `308db82` is adding two new methods for a `watched` property: a getter `isWatched()` and a setter `setWatched(boolean)`. 

Since these are completely new methods that don't conflict with any existing implementation (they're just being added after the `setCreated` method), this is a straightforward addition that should be included in the merged result.

```java
    }

    public void setCreated(long created) {
        this.created = created;
    }

    public boolean isWatched() {
        return isWatched;
    }

    public void setWatched(boolean isWatched) {
        this.isWatched = isWatched;
    }
}
```
