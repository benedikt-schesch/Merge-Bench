The merge conflict appears to be between two different classes: `CustomBlackCard` and `CardcastBlackCard`. Each have slightly different constructor signatures, with the same parameters except that one calls the last parameter `watermark` and the other calls it `deckId`. However, the field is named `watermark` in both cases. Since I can't determine the intended semantic resolution without more context about these classes, I'll preserve the conflict.

```java
  private final String text;
  private final int draw;
  private final int pick;
  private final String watermark;

<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomBlackCard.java
  public CustomBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick, final String watermark) {
=======
  public CardcastBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick,
                           final String deckId) {

    this.id = id;
    this.text = text;
    this.draw = draw;
    this.pick = pick;
    this.watermark = watermark;
