I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide a resolution:

```java
                    flinger.setImageBitmap(info.mThumbnail);
                    flinger.doAnimation();
                }
            });


            // Unlock camera auto settings
            mCamManager.setLockSetup(false);
            mCamManager.setStabilization(false);
        }

```

The conflict is simply about whitespace - the HEAD version has extra blank lines, while the other commit removes those blank lines. I preserved the formatting from HEAD which includes the blank lines, as they don't affect functionality and may have been added for readability.
