Looking at this merge conflict, I see two different approaches to handling work experience:
1. On HEAD: Using `WorkExperience` class
2. From a17acec: Using `Work` class

This appears to be a class type change for the work experience list. Without seeing the implementation of both classes or understanding the surrounding codebase context, it's difficult to determine which approach is the correct one.

Since this could represent a significant change in class design or API, I'll preserve the conflict for manual resolution:

```java

  @Facebook
  private List<UserDevice> devices = new ArrayList<UserDevice>();

  @Facebook
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private List<WorkExperience> work = new ArrayList<WorkExperience>();
=======
  private List<Work> work = new ArrayList<Work>();
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  @Facebook
  private List<Education> education = new ArrayList<Education>();

  @Facebook

```
