Looking at the merge conflict, side A simply has a print statement, while side B has a call to `lp.optimize()` followed by the same print statement. The intent on side B seems to be to add an optimization step before checking the physical plan. Since this doesn't appear to conflict with the intent of side A's print statement, I'll resolve by keeping both changes.

```java
    }

    private PhysicalPlan checkPhysicalPlan(LogicalPlan lp, int expectedRoots,
            int expectedLeaves, int expectedSize) throws IOException {

        lp.optimize(myPig.getPigContext());
        System.out.println("===== check physical plan =====");        

        PhysicalPlan pp = ((MRExecutionEngine)myPig.getPigContext().getExecutionEngine()).compile(
                lp, null);

        Assert.assertEquals(expectedRoots, pp.getRoots().size());

```
