Looking at this merge conflict, the changes from the incoming branch (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309) are adding two new constants for file path style formats (UNIX and WINDOWS), which don't exist in the current branch. Since these constants appear to be adding new functionality without conflicting with existing code, I'll resolve this by including both changes.

```java

public class FileLocalizer {
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(FileLocalizer.class);
    
    static public final String LOCAL_PREFIX  = "file:";
    static public final int STYLE_UNIX = 0;
    static public final int STYLE_WINDOWS = 1;

    public static class DataStorageInputStreamIterator extends InputStream {
        InputStream current;
        ElementDescriptor[] elements;
        int currentElement;

```
