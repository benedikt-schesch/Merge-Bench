Looking at this merge conflict, the HEAD version includes imports from SAMOA's topology implementation packages, while the incoming change (87ea390f) has removed these imports. Based on the context, it appears the incoming change is removing imports that might not be needed, while keeping the essential `Task` import (which appears in both versions but in different positions).

Here's the resolved snippet:
