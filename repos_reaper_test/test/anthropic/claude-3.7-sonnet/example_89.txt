Looking at the merge conflict, it appears that both sides are introducing new annotations. The first side is adding `ServerDiscoveryPort` while the other is adding `AllowBlankCards`. These are separate annotations with different purposes, so neither should be discarded. Let me resolve this by preserving both annotations:

```java
  public @interface BannedNicks {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

Note: I've kept the second conflict marker since we don't have the complete context to resolve it properly. We'd need to see what follows after this incomplete block.
