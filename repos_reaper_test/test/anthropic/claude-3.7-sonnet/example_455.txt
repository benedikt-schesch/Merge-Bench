Based on the merge conflict, I need to decide whether the `@required` annotation should be kept or removed for the `mode` parameter. Looking at the context:

1. The parameter has a default value of "TXT"
2. One version has marked it as required, while the other has removed this annotation

Since the parameter has a default value, marking it as required is somewhat contradictory - a parameter with a default value doesn't necessarily need to be explicitly provided by the user. The default value ensures it will always have a value.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
public class Args4jUsageMojo extends AbstractMojo {

    /**
     * Mode. 'TXT' 'XML' or 'HTML'
     * @parameter default-value="TXT"
     */
    private String mode;

    /**
     * Location of the source files.

```

I've removed the `@required` annotation since it's redundant with a default value specified.
