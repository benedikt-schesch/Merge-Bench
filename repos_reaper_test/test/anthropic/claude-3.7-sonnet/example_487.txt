I'll resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intent behind both changes. 

Looking at the changes, one side is using `BitmapTexture` for the font texture while the other is using `BitmapTextureAtlas`. This appears to be a change in the type of texture being used for fonts, possibly due to a library upgrade or change in implementation approach.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d

	private TextureRegion mRadarPointTextureRegion;
	private TextureRegion mRadarTextureRegion;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mFontTexture;
	private Font mFont;

	private Location mUserLocation;

	private final ArrayList<City> mCities = new ArrayList<City>();

```

I resolved the conflict by choosing the `BitmapTextureAtlas mFontTexture` implementation, as it appears to be from the newer commit (91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d) and likely represents an update or improvement to the texture handling in the application.
