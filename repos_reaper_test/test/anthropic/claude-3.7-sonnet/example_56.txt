Looking at the merge conflict, I see that the only difference is the formatting. One version has the query split across multiple lines, and the other has it on a single line. Since this is purely a style difference and doesn't affect functionality, I'll choose the multi-line version as it's generally more readable.

```java
    synchronized (options.cardSetIds) {
      try {
        final List<CardSet> cardSets = new ArrayList<>();

        if (!options.getPyxCardSetIds().isEmpty()) {
          @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") final List<CardSet> pyxCardSets = session
              .createQuery("from PyxCardSet where id in (:ids)")
              .setParameterList("ids", options.getPyxCardSetIds()).list();
          cardSets.addAll(pyxCardSets);
        }

        // Not injecting the service itself because we might need to assisted inject it later
        // with card id stuff.
```
