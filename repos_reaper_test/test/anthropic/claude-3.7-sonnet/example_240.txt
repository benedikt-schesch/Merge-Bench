Looking at this merge conflict, I see that the import section is being modified. The conflict is straightforward - the branch being merged in (1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81) is adding two additional import statements: `import java.io.OutputStream;` and `import java.lang.reflect.Method;`. Since there's no overlap or conflicting changes, and these additional imports are likely needed for functionality added in that branch, I'll resolve by including both imports.

```java
package org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collection;
