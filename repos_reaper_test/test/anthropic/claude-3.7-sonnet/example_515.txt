Looking at the code, I can see this is a merge conflict related to unloading a texture resource. The conflict is about which texture object should be unloaded - either `mBitmapTexture` or `mBitmapTextureAtlas`.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
			@Override
			public boolean onAreaTouched(final TouchEvent pSceneTouchEvent, final float pTouchAreaLocalX, final float pTouchAreaLocalY) {
				/* Completely remove all resources associated with this sprite. */
				BufferObjectManager.getActiveInstance().unloadBufferObject(this.getVertexBuffer());
				BufferObjectManager.getActiveInstance().unloadBufferObject(UnloadResourcesExample.this.mClickToUnloadTextureRegion.getTextureBuffer());
				UnloadResourcesExample.this.mEngine.getTextureManager().unloadTexture(UnloadResourcesExample.this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);

				/* And remove the sprite from the Scene. */
				final Sprite thisRef = this;
				UnloadResourcesExample.this.runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
					@Override
```

I chose the newer version with `mBitmapTextureAtlas` because it appears there was likely a refactoring from `mBitmapTexture` to `mBitmapTextureAtlas`, which is a more descriptive name that better reflects the texture atlas functionality in the engine.
