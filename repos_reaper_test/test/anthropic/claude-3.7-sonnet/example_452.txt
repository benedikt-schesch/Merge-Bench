Looking at the merge conflict, one side (HEAD) is importing `java.util.TreeMap`, while the other side (a9676fd...) is removing this import.

To resolve this, I need to consider whether `TreeMap` is actually used in the code. Since I don't have access to the rest of the file, I can't determine with certainty if `TreeMap` is needed. However, the fact that it was removed in the other branch suggests it might be an unused import.

Since I cannot make a definitive determination about the intent without seeing the full code, I will preserve the merge conflict:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;
import java.util.Set;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import java.util.TreeMap;
