Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has an empty implementation of `visitMapLookUp` while the other side (88ae4a5) has an empty line inside the method body. Since both sides are essentially just stub implementations with "TODO Auto-generated method stub" comments, the addition of an extra blank line doesn't change any functionality. I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the cleaner implementation without the extra blank line.

```java
        //do nothing
    }

    public void visitMapLookUp(POMapLookUp mapLookUp) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    }

    public void visitCast(POCast cast) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    }

```
