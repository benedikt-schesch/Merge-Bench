Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the return type of the `openScanner` method has changed:
- HEAD version: `Deferred<Long>`
- Incoming version (d543609): `Deferred<Object>`

This seems to be a type broadening change. Based on the method's documentation comment, it states that the method returns "A deferred scanner ID (long) if HBase 0.94 and before, or a deferred {@link Scanner.Response} if HBase 0.95 and up." This suggests that the method might need to return different types depending on the HBase version, which would explain why someone changed it to the more generic `Deferred<Object>`.

Here's my resolution:

```java
   * Package-private access point for {@link Scanner}s to open themselves.
   * @param scanner The scanner to open.
   * @return A deferred scanner ID (long) if HBase 0.94 and before, or a
   * deferred {@link Scanner.Response} if HBase 0.95 and up.
   */
  Deferred<Object> openScanner(final Scanner scanner) {
    num_scanners_opened.increment();
    return sendRpcToRegion(scanner.getOpenRequest()).addCallbacks(
      scanner_opened,
      new Callback<Object, Object>() {
        public Object call(final Object error) {
```
