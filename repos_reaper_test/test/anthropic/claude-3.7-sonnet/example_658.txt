After analyzing the merge conflict, I can see that there's a new method being added in the HEAD version but being removed in the merge commit. Given the API method structure and typical HTTP client patterns, I'll preserve the new method.

```java
   */
  @Override
  public Response executePost(String url, String parameters, BinaryAttachment... binaryAttachments) throws IOException {
    return response;
  }
  
  @Override
  public Response executePost(String url, Map<String, String> headers, String parameters, BinaryAttachment... binaryAttachments) throws IOException {
    return response;
  }
}
```
