Looking at the merge conflict, both sides have the same logic and content, but the formatting is slightly different. The HEAD version has the error message split across two lines, while the other version has the error message on a single line. Since the logic and content are identical, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the single-line version for simplicity.

```java
        if (language != null) {
            if ("swagger".equals(language)) {
                definition = SwaggerUtils
                        .getDefinition(defSource, ulogin, upwd);
            } else {
                failWithErrorMessage("The language " + language + " is not currently supported. ");
            }
        } else {
            if (defSource != null) {
                Class<?> clazz = null;
                try {
```
