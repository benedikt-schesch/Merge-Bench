Looking at this merge conflict, it appears to be simply a line formatting difference. The code logic is identical on both sides, but the `HEAD` version has the condition on a single line while the incoming version (`c923751`) has broken it into two lines for better readability.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
        if (event.getActionMasked() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {
            mDownX = event.getRawX();
            mDownY = event.getRawY();
            mListener.onShutterButtonPressed();
        } else if (event.getActionMasked() == MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE) {
            if ((event.getRawY() - mDownY < -getHeight() / 2 || Math.abs(event.getRawX()
                    - mDownX) > getWidth() / 2) && mListener != null) {
                if (!mSlideOpen) {
                    mListener.onSlideOpen();
                    mSlideOpen = true;
                }
            } else {
```

I've chosen the formatting from the incoming change since it appears to be a deliberate formatting improvement for readability, breaking the long condition across multiple lines.
