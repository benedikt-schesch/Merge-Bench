Looking at this merge conflict, I see that both sides are trying to log a similar debug message when enum mapping fails. Let's analyze:

- HEAD is using `rawValue.asString()` to get the string value that failed to map
- The other branch is using `jsonObject.getString(facebookFieldName)` to get the same value

The context shows that `rawValue` is the variable being used in the surrounding code (we see it referenced both before and after the conflict). The variable `jsonObject` and `facebookFieldName` don't appear in the provided context and were likely introduced in the other branch.

Since the rest of the method is using `rawValue`, I'll resolve in favor of HEAD:

```java
      Class<? extends Enum> enumType = type.asSubclass(Enum.class);
      try {
        return Enum.valueOf(enumType, rawValue.asString());
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException iae) {
        if (MAPPER_LOGGER.isDebugEnabled()) {
          MAPPER_LOGGER.debug(format("Cannot map string %s to enum %s", rawValue.asString(), enumType.getName()));
        }
      }
    }

    String rawValueAsString = jsonHelper.getStringFrom(rawValue);

```
