Looking at the merge conflict, I see one side is trying to add an import for `org.jbake.template.model.TemplateModel` while the other side is removing it. Since this is just an import statement, I should determine if this import is needed based on the rest of the codebase, but without that context, I'll have to make my best guess.

The fact that the import is being removed in the newer commit (d68ddea7...) suggests it might no longer be needed, possibly because the class was refactored or the dependency was removed.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

import org.apache.commons.configuration.CompositeConfiguration;
import org.jbake.app.ContentStore;
import org.jbake.app.FileUtil;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeConfiguration;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.Writer;

```

I've resolved the conflict by removing the import, following the direction of the newer commit, as it appears the TemplateModel import may no longer be needed in the codebase.
