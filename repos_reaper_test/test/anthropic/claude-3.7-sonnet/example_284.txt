Looking at the merge conflict, the intent is clear:

1. The HEAD version simply assigns `pkgr` to the instance variable.
2. The commit from `88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a` not only assigns `pkgr` but also sets up relationships by calling `setParent(this)` and `setIllustrator(illustrator)` on the newly assigned packager.

Since the second version performs the same assignment plus additional relationship setup, it offers more functionality without contradicting the first version. I'll resolve by keeping the more complete implementation:

```java
        return pkgr;
    }

    public void setPkgr(Packager pkgr) {
        this.pkgr = pkgr;
        pkgr.setParent(this);
        pkgr.setIllustrator(illustrator);
    }
