Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to provide a link to the HTTP RFC section about Media-types, but with slightly different formatting and link URLs. I'll resolve it by combining the intent of both changes while ensuring the documentation is clear and the link is accurate.

```java

import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

/**
 * HTTP Media-type as specified in the <a
 * href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-3.7">HTTP RFC</a>.
 *
 * <p>Implementation is not thread-safe.
