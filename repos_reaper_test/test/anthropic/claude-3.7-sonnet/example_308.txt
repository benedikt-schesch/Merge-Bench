Looking at the merge conflict, it appears both sides are defining the `TRANSCODING_PARAMETERS` constant, with the only difference being the `HEAD` version includes a `threads=2` parameter at the end that the other version doesn't have.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
														// if Google blocks this

	private static final String HEADER_APPLICATION_URL = "Application-URL";
	private static final String CHROME_CAST_MODEL_NAME = "Eureka Dongle";
	private static final String TRANSCODING_EXTENSIONS = "wmv,avi,mkv,mpg,mpeg,flv,3gp,ogm";
	private static final String TRANSCODING_PARAMETERS = "vcodec=VP80,vb=1000,vfilter=canvas{width=640,height=360},acodec=vorb,ab=128,channels=2,samplerate=44100,threads=2";
	private static final String PROPERTY_TRANSCODING_EXTENSIONS = "transcoding.extensions";
	private static final String PROPERTY_TRANSCODING_PARAMETERS = "transcoding.parameters";
	private int port = EmbeddedServer.HTTP_PORT;
	private List<DialServer> servers = new ArrayList<DialServer>();
	private JComboBox deviceList;
```

I chose to keep the HEAD version which includes the `threads=2` parameter, as it appears to be an enhancement to the transcoding parameters, specifying that 2 threads should be used for transcoding, which would likely improve performance.
