Looking at the merge conflict, I notice that one side (HEAD) has added a `listeners` field declaration, while the other side (from commit b782a4bb) appears to have the same declaration but later in the file. Since both sides have the exact same code for the `listeners` field, this appears to be a simple case where the same change was made in different places.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
	@Inject
	private DexService dexService;
	
	@Inject
	private AndroidBuildService buildService;

	private List<AndroidBuildListener> listeners = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<AndroidBuildListener>());

	@Override
	public Set<IProject> build(int kind, IProgressMonitor monitor) throws Exception {

```

I kept one instance of the `listeners` declaration and removed the duplicate, maintaining the proper spacing between the fields and the `build` method.
