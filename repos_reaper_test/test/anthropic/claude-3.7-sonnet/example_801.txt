Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both changes.

The conflict involves keeping or removing the line `hbase_client.server_version = server_version;` before calling `helloRpc()`.

In this context, we're updating the `server_version` variable to `SERVER_VERSION_092_OR_ABOVE` after determining we need to handshake differently. One branch wants to also update this value in the `hbase_client` object, while the other branch doesn't want this line.

The resolution should be based on whether this update to the client object is necessary. Since this appears to be synchronizing state between local variable and the client object, and the code is handling version detection logic, I'll resolve by keeping the line to ensure the client has the correct version information.

```java
          // If we get here, it's because we tried to handshake with a server
          // running HBase 0.92 or above, but using a pre-0.92 handshake.  So
          // we know we have to handshake differently.
          server_version = SERVER_VERSION_092_OR_ABOVE;
          hbase_client.server_version = server_version;
          helloRpc(chan, header092());
        } else {
          // We get here if the server refused our 0.92-style handshake.  This
          // must be a future version of HBase that broke compatibility again,
          // and we don't know how to talk to it, so give up here.
```
