Looking at the merge conflict, I need to determine if the import for `com.restfb.JsonMapper` should be kept or removed. Since the code is still referencing `com.restfb.JsonMapper.JsonMappingCompleted` in the lines after the conflict, it seems the import for the parent class `JsonMapper` is needed for proper code structure, even though only the inner interface/class `JsonMappingCompleted` is being directly used.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromLongFormat;
import static com.restfb.util.DateUtils.toDateFromShortFormat;
import static java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList;

import com.restfb.Facebook;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper.JsonMappingCompleted;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
```
