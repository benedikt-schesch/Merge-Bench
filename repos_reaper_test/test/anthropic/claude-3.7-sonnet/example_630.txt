Here's the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
    if (compatFields != null && fields == null) {
      fields = new ArrayList<SubscriptionField>();
      for (String field : compatFields) {
        fields.add(new SubscriptionField(field));
      }
    } else if (compatFields == null && fields != null) {
      compatFields = new ArrayList<String>();
      for (SubscriptionField subscriptionField : fields) {
        compatFields.add(subscriptionField.getName());
      }
    }
  }

  public static class SubscriptionField extends AbstractFacebookType {

```

The intent here is clear. The first conditional (from HEAD) handles the conversion from `compatFields` (String list) to `fields` (SubscriptionField list) when only `compatFields` is present. The second conditional (from a17acec) does the opposite conversion - from `fields` to `compatFields` when only `fields` is present. These are complementary operations that handle different cases of the same data synchronization need, so both should be preserved.
