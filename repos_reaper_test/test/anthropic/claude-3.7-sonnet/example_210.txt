Looking at the code, I can see that this is a merge conflict for the `Session session;` declaration in the `SSHSocketImpl` class. The HEAD version has the declaration, and so does the commit 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309, but with different indentation.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
 * things to SSH.
 */
class SSHSocketImpl extends SocketImpl {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImpl.class);

    Session session;

    ChannelDirectTCPIP channel;

```

I removed the duplicate declaration of the `Session session;` field, preserving the second one that uses spaces for indentation to match the rest of the code style, and kept the proper spacing between fields.
