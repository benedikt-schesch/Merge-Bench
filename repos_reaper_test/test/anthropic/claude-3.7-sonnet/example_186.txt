Based on the merge conflict, it looks like one side is trying to maintain imports for a `StarSpec.java` file, while the other side is establishing a package declaration for a `NodeIdGenerator.java` file. Since the rest of the code is for `NodeIdGenerator.java` (as seen from the class name), I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the package declaration while preserving the necessary imports:

package org.apache.pig.impl.plan;

import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class NodeIdGenerator {
