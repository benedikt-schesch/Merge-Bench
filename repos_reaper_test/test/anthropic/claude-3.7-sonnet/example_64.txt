Looking at this merge conflict, I can see two ways of converting the `players` collection to an array:

1. The first approach allocates a new array of the exact size needed: `players.toArray(new Player[players.size()])`
2. The second approach uses a zero-length array: `players.toArray(new Player[0])`

The second approach (using `new Player[0]`) is actually the recommended practice in modern Java, as it's more efficient. When a zero-length array is provided, the JVM can optimize the allocation better. The first approach creates an unnecessary array that will be discarded.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
   * @return The {@code Player} object representing {@code user} in this game, or {@code null} if
   * {@code user} is not in this game.
   */
  @Nullable
  public Player getPlayerForUser(final User user) {
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      if (player.getUser() == user) {
        return player;
      }
    }

```
