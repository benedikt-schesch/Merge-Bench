Based on the code snippet, it looks like there's a merge conflict in the `seekTo` method. The HEAD version is using `mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery)` while the incoming change is using `sMediaPlayer` directly.

Here's the resolved code, preserving the full context:

```java
>>>>>>> ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66
    }

    @Override
    public void seekTo(long msec) {
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            sMediaPlayer.seekTo((int) msec);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void tryPrepareNext(final Query query) {
        TomahawkRunnable r = new TomahawkRunnable(1) {

```

I've merged the two versions by keeping the variable definition from HEAD and the null check pattern from the incoming change, since both seem to represent important constraints.
