Based on the merge conflict, both sides are doing the same thing but with different formatting of the logging statement. One has the message and exception parameter on the same line, while the other breaks them across two lines. 

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
        try {
            for (String c : jaxRsResources) {
                resources.add(Class.forName(c));
            }
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE,
                    "Cannot locate the JAXRS resource class.", e);
            System.exit(1);
        }
        Reference baseRef = endpoint != null ? new Reference(endpoint) : null;
        return JaxRsIntrospector.getDefinition(jaxrsApplication,

```

I chose the formatting from the second version (from commit 1d97bfac1d91e13b3835ca099b3a998c1969478f) as it's generally more readable to have the message string on a separate line, especially with longer messages. The functional behavior is identical in both cases.
