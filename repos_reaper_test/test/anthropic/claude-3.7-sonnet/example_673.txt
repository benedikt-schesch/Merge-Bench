Looking at the merge conflict, I'll resolve it based on the semantics of both versions:

```java
	
	private final UriTemplate authorizeUrl;
	
	private final String accessTokenUrl;

	public AccountProviderParameters(String name, String displayName, String apiKey, String secret, Long appId,
			String requestTokenUrl, String authorizeUrl, String callbackUrl, String accessTokenUrl) {
		this.name = name;
		this.displayName = displayName;
		this.apiKey = apiKey;
		this.secret = secret;
		this.appId = appId;

```

The merge resolution keeps the HEAD version because it contains more parameters including `displayName` and `callbackUrl` that aren't present in the other version. The fact that the class already has a `displayName` variable (as seen in the code after the conflict) suggests that the HEAD version is the correct one.
