I'll resolve this merge conflict by considering the intent on both sides. It looks like both sides are adding conditions to check for different flags that indicate help is needed.

```java
    public String getConfigValue() {
        return config;
    }

    public boolean isHelpNeeded() {
        return helpNeeded || helpRequested || !(isListConfig() || isBake() || isRunServer() || isInit() || source != null || destination != null);
    }

    public boolean isRunServer() {
        return runServer;
    }

```

The resolution combines both changes by including both `helpNeeded` and `helpRequested` flags, as well as adding the `isListConfig()` check that was introduced in the incoming change.
