Looking at the merge conflict, it appears that branch `d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f` is adding a static final byte array constant called `MUTATE` to the `IsEdit` interface, while the HEAD branch has an empty interface. Since the added constant provides useful functionality without breaking anything, and there's no conflicting implementation in HEAD, I'll resolve by keeping the added constant.

```java
  /**
   * Package-private interface to mark RPCs that are changing data in HBase.
   * @since 1.4
   */
  interface IsEdit {
    /** RPC method name to use with HBase 0.95+.  */
    static final byte[] MUTATE = { 'M', 'u', 't', 'a', 't', 'e' };
  }

  /*
   * This class, although it's part of the public API, is mostly here to make
   * it easier for this library to manipulate the HBase RPC protocol.

```
