Looking at this merge conflict, it appears both sides are importing different classes from the same package structure. One side is importing `LitePackager` while the other is importing `Packager`. Since both imports could be needed, and there's no clear indication that one should replace the other, I'll include both imports.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Iterator;

import org.apache.pig.PigException;
import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecException;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.LitePackager;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.physicalLayer.relationalOperators.Packager;
import org.apache.pig.impl.io.NullableTuple;
import org.apache.pig.impl.io.PigNullableWritable;
