Looking at this merge conflict, it seems that one side of the merge (HEAD) doesn't have the `fetchAll()` method and its implementation, while the other side (760cca9...) adds this method. Since there are no overlapping changes but rather just an addition of a new method, I'll resolve it by accepting the added method.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                new IntentFilter(InfoSystem.INFOSYSTEM_RESULTSREPORTED));
        TomahawkApp.getContext().registerReceiver(mCollectionManagerReceiver,
                new IntentFilter(InfoSystem.INFOSYSTEM_OPLOGISEMPTIED));
        TomahawkApp.getContext().registerReceiver(mCollectionManagerReceiver,
                new IntentFilter(DatabaseHelper.PLAYLISTSDATASOURCE_RESULTSREPORTED));
    }

    public void fetchAll() {
        fetchPlaylists();
        fetchLovedItemsPlaylist();
        fetchStarredAlbums();
        fetchStarredArtists();
    }

    public static CollectionManager getInstance() {
        return Holder.instance;
    }

```
