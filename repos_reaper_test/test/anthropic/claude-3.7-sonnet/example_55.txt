Looking at the merge conflict, both sides are calling the same method `metrics.gameStart()` with the same parameters, just with different formatting. The HEAD version has the parameters broken across multiple lines, while the 5adedd24 commit version has all parameters on a single line.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
        synchronized (options.cardSetIds) {
          cardSets = loadCardSets(session);
          blackDeck = loadBlackDeck(cardSets);
          whiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
        }
        metrics.gameStart(currentUniqueId, cardSets, options.blanksInDeck, options.playerLimit,
            options.scoreGoal, !StringUtils.isBlank(options.password));
        startNextRound();
        gameManager.broadcastGameListRefresh();
      }
      return started;
    } finally {
```

I chose the HEAD version with the multi-line formatting as it's better for readability, especially for method calls with many parameters.
