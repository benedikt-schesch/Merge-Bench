Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that the `HEAD` version has removed some imports, while the other branch has kept them. Since these are import statements, keeping them is generally safer than removing them, as they might be needed for the code to compile and function correctly.

```java
import java.util.Comparator;

import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Rule;

import org.fest.assertions.internal.Failures;
import org.fest.assertions.internal.LongArrays;
import org.fest.test.ExpectedException;
import org.fest.assertions.util.AbsValueComparator;
import org.fest.util.ComparatorBasedComparisonStrategy;
import org.fest.util.StandardComparisonStrategy;
