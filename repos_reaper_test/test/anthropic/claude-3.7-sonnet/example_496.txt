Looking at this merge conflict, I'm seeing a change in the type of texture being used. One branch uses `BitmapTexture` while the other uses `BitmapTextureAtlas`. Since the variable name has also changed from `mBitmapTexture` to `mBitmapTextureAtlas`, this appears to be an intentional change to use a different class for texture management.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private int mFaceIDCounter;
	private final SparseArray<Sprite> mFaces = new SparseArray<Sprite>();

```

I've chosen the newer implementation using `BitmapTextureAtlas` as it appears to be a more specific implementation that likely replaces the more generic `BitmapTexture`. The change in variable name also suggests this is an intentional upgrade.
