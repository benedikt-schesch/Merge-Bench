I'll resolve this merge conflict by considering the semantics of both sides.

```java
   * @param deferred A deferred one can wait on before retrying the failed RPC.
   */
  PleaseThrottleException(final String msg,
                          final HBaseException cause,
                          final HBaseRpc rpc,
                          final Deferred<?> deferred) {
    super(msg, cause);
    this.rpc = rpc;
    this.deferred = deferred;
  }

```

The conflict is about the type parameter of `Deferred`. The newer version (from the incoming change) adds a wildcard generic type `<?>` to make the parameter type more specific, which is a good practice for type safety. This is a common pattern when the exact generic type isn't important but we want to maintain type safety, so I've chosen this version.
