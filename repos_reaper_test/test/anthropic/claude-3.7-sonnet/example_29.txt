Looking at this merge conflict, I see that both sides are importing a `Vector3` class, but from different packages. The HEAD version uses `org.spout.math.vector.Vector3` while the other branch uses `org.spout.api.math.Vector3`. Also, the second version has an extra blank line after the import.

Given the limited context and ambiguous intent, I'll keep the merge conflict as is since it's not clear which Vector3 implementation is required:

```java

package org.spout.api.collision;

import org.spout.api.math.ReactConverter;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;

public class SpoutContactInfo {
	private final ContactInfo wrapped;
