Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side added an import for Google Play Games Services (`com.google.android.gms.games.Games`), while the other side removed it or never had it. 

Since this is an import statement, I need to consider whether the code actually uses this import elsewhere. Without seeing the full file, I can't be certain, but typically you would keep imports that are required by the code and remove unused ones.

Given the limited context, I'll resolve this by keeping the import since removing a required import would break the code, whereas keeping an unused import is generally just a minor issue that linting tools can fix later.

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Locale;

import com.google.android.gms.games.Games;

import de.j4velin.pedometer.background.SensorListener;
import de.j4velin.pedometer.util.Logger;
import android.app.AlertDialog;
import android.app.Dialog;
import android.content.Context;
