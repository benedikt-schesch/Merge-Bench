Looking at the merge conflict, I observe that the HEAD version includes an import for `org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils`, while this import has been removed in the other branch (31d7966e3896819a99b31f10e83e864e3805bcbd).

Without seeing the rest of the file or understanding the specific usage of `DigestUtils`, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the import since it's more likely that the import was added for a reason (e.g., to use digest functionality) rather than removed intentionally.

```java
import javax.annotation.Nonnull;
import javax.annotation.Nullable;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

import org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils;
import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;

/**
