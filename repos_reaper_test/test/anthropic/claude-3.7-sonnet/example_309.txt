Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine the intent of both sides. 

On one side (HEAD), there's a return statement that returns a string variable `str`, which is likely the result of reading from the stream.

The other side (b807ede...) removes this return statement entirely.

Analyzing the context, after this method there's another method `asJSONObject()` which appears to call `asString()` - implying that the method we're looking at is likely `asString()` which should return a string.

Given that the following method depends on this method returning a string, removing the return statement would break the code. Therefore, keeping the return statement makes the most sense semantically.

```java
            if (reader != null) {
                reader.close();
                setStreamConsumed(true);
            }
        }
        return str;
    }

    public JSONObject asJSONObject() throws ResponseException {
        try {
            return new JSONObject(asString());
```
