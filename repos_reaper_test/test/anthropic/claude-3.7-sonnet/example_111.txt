I'll resolve this merge conflict in the provided Java code snippet. Looking at the conflict, one side (HEAD) is removing the import statements for `org.fest.assertions.internal.Failures` and `org.fest.assertions.internal.Shorts`, while the other side is adding them.

The resolution should depend on whether these imports are needed elsewhere in the file. Since I don't have the complete context to determine if these imports are used in the code, I'll preserve them as they're likely needed for the test class. Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.spy;

import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Rule;

import org.fest.assertions.internal.Failures;
import org.fest.assertions.internal.Shorts;
import org.fest.test.ExpectedException;
import org.fest.assertions.util.AbsValueComparator;
import org.fest.util.ComparatorBasedComparisonStrategy;
