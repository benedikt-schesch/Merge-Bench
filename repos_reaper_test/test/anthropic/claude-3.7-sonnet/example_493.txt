Looking at this merge conflict, it appears there's a change in the texture handling class being used. The `HEAD` version uses `BitmapTexture` while the merged version uses `BitmapTextureAtlas`. These are likely different implementations for texture handling in what seems to be a graphics/game engine.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

	protected Camera mCamera;

	protected Scene mMainScene;

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	protected MenuScene mMenuScene;


```

I've chosen the `BitmapTextureAtlas` implementation as it appears to be the newer version, and the code likely uses this texture atlas class to handle the texture region defined immediately after it. The empty line at the end of the HEAD version seems to be unnecessary whitespace.
