I'll analyze this merge conflict for you.

The conflict is between two versions of a private field declaration: `mScoreFontTexture`. In the current HEAD version, it's defined as `BitmapTexture` type, while in the incoming commit (91801fdd77), it's defined as `BitmapTextureAtlas` type.

Looking at this, it appears to be a type change, likely due to a migration or API update. Since `BitmapTextureAtlas` sounds like a more specific implementation of a texture atlas (which would be appropriate for font textures), I believe the intent was to update the type to a more specific or updated class.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

	private Rectangle mBall;
	private final SparseArray<Rectangle> mPaddleMap = new SparseArray<Rectangle>();
	private final SparseArray<ChangeableText> mScoreChangeableTextMap = new SparseArray<ChangeableText>();

	private BitmapTextureAtlas mScoreFontTexture;
	private Font mScoreFont;

	private float mPaddleCenterY;
