Analyzing this merge conflict:

The right side (from c08e0d7adee3a6c42dfe2887fad422ea332c015e) is adding a new instance variable `mVoteTargetSpans` of type `URLSpan[]` to track URL spans, which seems to be related to the existing voting functionality. This addition doesn't conflict with any code from the left side, so it should be preserved.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
    private int mNumVisibleComments;

    // UI State
    private View mVoteTargetView = null;
    private CommentInfo mVoteTargetCommentInfo = null;
    private URLSpan[] mVoteTargetSpans = null;
    
    // ProgressDialogs with percentage bars
    private AutoResetProgressDialog mLoadingCommentsProgress;
    
    /**
```
