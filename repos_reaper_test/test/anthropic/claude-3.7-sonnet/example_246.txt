Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's just a difference in line break formatting for the method declaration. The newer version (1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81) has the `throws IOException` on a new line with proper indentation, while the HEAD version has it on the same line as the method declaration.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
     * is based and merge it with the Conf supplied
     *
     * package level access so that this is not publicly used elsewhere
     * @throws IOException
     */
    static void mergeSplitSpecificConf(LoadFunc loadFunc, PigSplit pigSplit, Configuration originalConf) 
            throws IOException {
        // set up conf with entries from input specific conf
        Job job = new Job(originalConf);
        loadFunc.setLocation(getLoadLocation(pigSplit.getInputIndex(),
                originalConf), job);
        // The above setLocation call could write to the conf within
```

I've chosen the version from the newer commit (1cb2531c41db7942eca2b75f500cfe7e4a8cad81) as it appears to follow a more consistent formatting style with the exception clause on a separate indented line, which improves readability.
