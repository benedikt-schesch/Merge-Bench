Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that the method `getIntermed()` is intended to return a class name. One side of the merge has it returning `Initial.class.getName()`, while the other side has it returning `Intermediate.class.getName()`.

Given that:
1. The method name is `getIntermed()`, which suggests it should return something related to "Intermediate"
2. There are other methods `getInitial()` and `getFinal()` which return their respective class names
3. The pattern appears to be that each method returns the class name matching its function

The most logical resolution is to use the `Intermediate.class.getName()` implementation:

```java
    public String getInitial() {
        return Initial.class.getName();
    }

    public String getIntermed() {
        return Intermediate.class.getName();
    }

    public String getFinal() {
        return Final.class.getName();
    }

```
