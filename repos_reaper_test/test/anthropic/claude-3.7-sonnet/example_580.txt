Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine whether `picture` should be of type `ProfilePictureSource` or `String`.

The conflict is about the data type of the `picture` field, but without more context on how the field is used or what `ProfilePictureSource` represents, it's difficult to determine the correct resolution.

I notice that there's a `@Facebook("picture")` annotation on the `rawPicture` field, which suggests that the raw data comes in as a JsonObject, and the `picture` field might be a processed version of this data.

Since I cannot confidently determine which type is correct without more context about the class's purpose and usage, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java

  @Facebook("picture")
  private JsonObject rawPicture;
