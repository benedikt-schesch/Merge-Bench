Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both changes:

1. The HEAD version creates a ServerSocket and then starts a try block, presumably to be followed by a finally block that would close the serverSocket.
2. The incoming change uses a try-with-resources statement that will automatically close the ServerSocket when the block is exited.

The intent is clearly to ensure proper resource management. The try-with-resources approach (from the incoming change) is a cleaner and safer Java 7+ pattern for ensuring resources are closed. I'll resolve in favor of that approach:

```java
	private List<TestEvent> sendMessageWithServerSocket(String input) throws UnknownHostException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
		return sendMessageWithServerSocket(new String[] { input });
	}

	private List<TestEvent> sendMessageWithServerSocket(String... messages) throws UnknownHostException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
		try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(0)) {
			RuntimeEnvironment fakeEnvironment = fakeEnvironment();
			File file = fakeEnvironment.createClasspathArgumentFile();
			
			ClasspathArgumentBuilder classpathArgumentBuilder = new FileClasspathArgumentBuilder(file);
			factory.startProcess(serverSocket.getLocalPort(), fakeEnvironment, classpathArgumentBuilder);
```
