It looks like there's a merge conflict in the author list. Based on the context, it seems that both changes are attempting to add a new author to the file. I'll resolve this by including both authors in the list:

```java
 * </p>
 * 
 * @author David DIDIER
 * @author Yvonne Wang
 * @author Alex Ruiz
 * @author Olivier Michallat
 * @author Olivier Demeijer
 */
public class FileAssert extends AbstractAssert<FileAssert, File> {

  @VisibleForTesting
  Files files = Files.instance();

```
