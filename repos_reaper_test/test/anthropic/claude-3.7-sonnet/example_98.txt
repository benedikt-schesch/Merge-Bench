Looking at the merge conflict, one side (HEAD) has added a comment indicating a safety check, while the other side has removed this comment. Since the actual functionality of the code is unchanged (only a comment is affected), I'll resolve this by keeping the comment as it provides context for the following code block.

```java
        return ErrorCode.NOT_JUDGE;
      } else if (state != GameState.JUDGING) {
        return ErrorCode.NOT_YOUR_TURN;
      }

      // shouldn't ever happen, but just in case...
      if (null != player) {
        player.resetSkipCount();
      }

      cardPlayer = playedCards.getPlayerForId(cardId);

```
