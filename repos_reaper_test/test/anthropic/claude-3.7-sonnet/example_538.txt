Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has a complete `requestLocationAction` method implementation, while the other side (2efc89d) seems to be removing that implementation. However, after the conflict marker, the same method appears again, but the snippet cuts off before showing its implementation.

Given the context available, this appears to be a case where the method is being moved or refactored rather than deleted completely. Since the method declaration appears again immediately after the conflict, I'll resolve by accepting the removal of the first implementation, assuming the intent is to have only one version of this method.

```java
        result = true; //Probably better to default to true
      }
    }

    return result;
  }

  private void requestLocationAction(CallbackContext callbackContext) {
    locationCallback = callbackContext;

```
