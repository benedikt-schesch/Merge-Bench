Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that one side is returning a `MockLowLevelHttpRequest()` without parameters, while the other side is returning `MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url)` with the URL as a parameter. Based on the context, specifically the `buildGetRequest` method which uses the URL parameter, it seems like the intent is to consistently pass the URL to the request constructor.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPostRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildPutRequest(String url) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
