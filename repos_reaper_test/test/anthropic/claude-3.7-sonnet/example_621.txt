Looking at the merge conflict, I need to analyze what both sides are trying to achieve.

The conflict is about import statements. The main branch has the imports for:
- com.restfb.util.DateUtils
- java.util.ArrayList
- java.util.Date
- java.util.List

The other branch (a17acec0...) includes all these imports plus:
- java.util.Iterator

Since adding an import doesn't typically break functionality and the Iterator import may be needed in the incoming changes, I'll include all imports:

```java
import com.restfb.util.DateUtils;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;

import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

```
