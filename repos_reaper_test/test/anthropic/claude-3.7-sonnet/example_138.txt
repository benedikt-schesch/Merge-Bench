Based on the merge conflict, I need to decide whether to keep the extra line of whitespace or not. Looking at the conflict, both HEAD and the commit from f6a8f7aa42cae344f71cc6759f1c7880b49211fc have a blank line after `private static final Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(MRJobStats.class);` - the only difference is that HEAD has an extra space character on that blank line.

Since both sides essentially have the same intent (a blank line for spacing), I'll resolve this by preserving the blank line without the extra space:

```java

    // currently counters are not working in local mode - see PIG-1286
    public static final String SUCCESS_HEADER_LOCAL = "JobId\tAlias\tFeature\tOutputs";

    private static final Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(MRJobStats.class);

    private List<POStore> mapStores = null;

    private List<POStore> reduceStores = null;

    private List<FileSpec> loads = null;

```
