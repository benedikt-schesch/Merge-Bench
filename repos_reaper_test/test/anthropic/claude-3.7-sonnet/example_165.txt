Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine the correct method to use based on semantic intent.

Upon analysis, this conflict involves a method call discrepancy: `context.getDfs()` versus `context.getFs()`. Both versions are trying to obtain a storage interface from the PigContext, but using different method names.

Since the returned value is directly passed to the `fileExists` method that takes a `DataStorage` parameter, I need to choose the correct method based on what exists in the PigContext class.

Without additional context about which method is correct in the current version of PigContext, I'll resolve based on what appears to be a method renaming from `getDfs()` (possibly legacy) to `getFs()` (possibly newer).

```java
        }
    }

    public static boolean fileExists(String filename, PigContext context)
            throws IOException {
        return fileExists(filename, context.getFs());
    }

    public static boolean fileExists(String filename, DataStorage store)
            throws IOException {
        ElementDescriptor elem = store.asElement(filename);

```

I chose `context.getFs()` as it appears to be the newer implementation based on the commit hash inclusion in the incoming change.
