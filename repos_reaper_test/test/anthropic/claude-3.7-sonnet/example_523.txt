Based on the merge conflict, it appears that one side (HEAD) is adding a new private field `maxImageSize`, while the other side (790b69a0bd40e3ab536f9c6568748f981b3d525e) is removing it or doesn't have it.

Since the field is being introduced in HEAD, and there's no competing implementation from the other branch, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the new field.

```java
    private String code = null;
    private int options = 1;
    private String mhtmlRoot = "";
    private String outputFilename = "";
    private int maxUriLength = DEFAULT_MAX_URI_LENGTH;  //IE8 only allows dataURIs up to 32KB
    private int maxImageSize;
