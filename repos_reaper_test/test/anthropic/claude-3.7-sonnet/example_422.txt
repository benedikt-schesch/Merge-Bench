Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are adding different import statements to the code. Since they're adding separate imports that don't conflict functionally and both might be needed, the best resolution is to keep both imports.

```java
package org.jbake.template.model;

import org.jbake.app.ContentStore;
import org.jbake.app.DocumentList;
import org.jbake.app.configuration.JBakeProperty;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentModel;
import org.jbake.model.DocumentTypes;
import org.jbake.template.ModelExtractor;

import java.util.Map;

```
