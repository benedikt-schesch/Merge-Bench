Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java

 */
package org.spout.api.util.cuboid;

import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;

/**
 * This class implements a Cuboid common methods for a one dimensional array Cuboid Buffer
 *
 * Elements are stored in column order and each column is +1 on the Z dimension relative to the previous one.
```

I've merged the imports from both sides. I kept the `org.spout.math.vector.Vector3` import from HEAD and the `org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk` import from the other branch, as it appears both sides were making different but compatible changes to the imports.
