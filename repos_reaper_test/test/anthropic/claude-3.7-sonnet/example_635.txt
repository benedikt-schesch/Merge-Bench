The merge conflict appears to be about including or removing a `serialVersionUID` field in the `UserDevice` class. Based on the standard Java practices for serializable classes, I'll resolve this by keeping the serialVersionUID field, as it's important for version control of serializable classes.

```java
   * 
   * @author <a href="http://restfb.com">Norbert Bartels</a>
   */
  public static class UserDevice extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String hardware;


```
