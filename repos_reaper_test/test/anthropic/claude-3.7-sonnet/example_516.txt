Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are essentially trying to toggle between two different image assets, but they're using different variable names and path structures. Let me resolve this:

```java
	// ===========================================================
	// Methods
	// ===========================================================

	private void toggle() {
		this.mBitmapTextureAtlas.clearTextureAtlasSources();
		this.mToggleBox = !this.mToggleBox;
		BitmapTextureAtlasTextureRegionFactory.createTiledFromAsset(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, this, this.mToggleBox ? "gfx/face_box_tiled.png" : "gfx/face_circle_tiled.png", 0, 0, 2, 1);
	}

	// ===========================================================
	// Inner and Anonymous Classes
	// ===========================================================

```

I resolved this by choosing the newer version because:
1. It appears the code has evolved from using `mBitmapTexture` to `mBitmapTextureAtlas`
2. The corresponding methods have changed from `clearTextureSources()` to `clearTextureAtlasSources()`
3. The factory class has changed from `BitmapTextureRegionFactory` to `BitmapTextureAtlasTextureRegionFactory`
4. The asset paths have been reorganized to include a "gfx/" prefix

The core functionality remains the same, but the newer version likely matches other updated code in the codebase.
