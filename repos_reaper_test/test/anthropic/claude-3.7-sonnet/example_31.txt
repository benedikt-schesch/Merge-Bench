Looking at this merge conflict, I see that both sides are essentially doing the same thing - creating a perspective projection matrix. The differences are minor:

1. One side uses `Matrix4.createPerspective` while the other uses `MatrixMath.createPerspective`
2. One side assigns to `projection` while the other assigns to `this.projection`
3. There's a slight difference in the comment format (`TODO Get FOV` vs `TODO: Get FOV`)

Since both sides are trying to achieve the same thing, I'll merge them with the more explicit version:

```java
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public void onAttached() {
		// TODO: Get FOV
		this.projection = MatrixMath.createPerspective(fieldOfView, 4.0f / 3.0f, .001f, 1000f);
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public Matrix4 getProjection() {

```
