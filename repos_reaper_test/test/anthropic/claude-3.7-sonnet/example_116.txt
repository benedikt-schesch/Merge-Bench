Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are adding a new author to the documentation. Since these are author attributions, it makes sense to keep both of them. The proper resolution is to include both authors in the documentation.

```java
 *          for more details.
 * @param <A> the type of the "actual" value.
 * 
 * @author Alex Ruiz
 * @author Joel Costigliola
 * @author Mikhail Mazursky
 * @author Nicolas Fran√ßois
 */
public abstract class AbstractAssert<S extends AbstractAssert<S, A>, A> implements Assert<S, A> {

  @VisibleForTesting
  Objects objects = Objects.instance();
