Looking at this merge conflict, I see changes to the `ReadOnceBag` constructor parameter types and names. The constructor takes a packager, an iterator of tuples, and a key.

The HEAD version uses `LitePackager` and `Object key`, while the other branch uses `Packager` and `PigNullableWritable keyWritable`. The reference to `keyWritable` in the method body suggests that the second approach is more consistent with the actual implementation.

Here's the resolved version:

```java
     * copying the elements of the iterator.
     * @param pkg POPackageLite
     * @param tupIter Iterator<NullableTuple>
     * @param key Object
     */
    public ReadOnceBag(Packager pkgr, Iterator<NullableTuple> tupIter,
            PigNullableWritable keyWritable) {
        this.pkgr = pkgr;
        this.tupIter = tupIter;
        this.keyWritable = keyWritable;
    }

```
