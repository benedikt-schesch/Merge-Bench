Looking at the code, I notice a merge conflict over a method name: one version calls it `refreshSubCategories()` and the other calls it `rebuildSubCategories()`. Both seem to handle updating/sorting a list of video categories. Since this is just a method name change and there's no indication of which is more appropriate, I'll preserve the conflict as I don't have enough context to determine the correct intent.

```java
                mAdapter.add(0, new ListRow(header, listRowAdapter));
            }
        }
    }

        List<Video> videos = Video.listAll(Video.class);
        Collections.sort(videos, new Comparator<Video>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Video o1, Video o2) {
                return Long.valueOf(o2.getCreated()).compareTo(o1.getCreated());
```
