Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) includes an empty line before the `RemoveCallback` call, while the other side (2efc89dde2658f518e6b6ca936296c207e08d65c) has no empty line.

Since this is just a matter of whitespace and doesn't affect the functionality of the code, I'll resolve it by choosing the version without the extra blank line:

```java
          callbackContext.error(returnObj);
        }
        return;
      }

      RemoveCallback(characteristicUuid, connection, operationWrite);

      //If no callback, just return
      if (callbackContext == null) {
        return;
```
