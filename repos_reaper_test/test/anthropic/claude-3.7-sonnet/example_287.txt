Based on the snippet, I can see a merge conflict where one branch is not adding any code, and the other branch (`88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a`) is adding a line to store the input key `k` in a field called `keyWritable`. 

Looking at the context, this method is attaching input to the object and already stores the processed key in `key`, but it seems reasonable to also store the original key object in `keyWritable` for later reference. Since the change doesn't conflict with existing code and appears to be adding new functionality, I'll resolve by keeping the added line.

```java
     */
    public void attachInput(PigNullableWritable k, Iterator<NullableTuple> inp) {
        try {
            tupIter = inp;
            key = pkgr.getKey(k);
            keyWritable = k;
            inputAttached = true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "Error attaching input for key " + k +
                    " in " + name() + " at location " + getOriginalLocations(), e);

```
