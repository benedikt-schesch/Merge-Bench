Looking at this merge conflict, it seems the main branch (HEAD) has added an import for `org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils`, while the other branch (31d7966e3896819a99b31f10e83e864e3805bcbd) has removed it or never added it.

Since the proper resolution depends on whether the `DigestUtils` class is actually used in the code (which I can't determine from this snippet), I'll preserve the import as the more conservative approach - it's usually safer to have an unused import than to be missing a required one.

```java
import javax.annotation.Nonnull;
import javax.annotation.Nullable;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

import org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils;
import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;

/**
 * Various utility methods that don't have more proper home.
