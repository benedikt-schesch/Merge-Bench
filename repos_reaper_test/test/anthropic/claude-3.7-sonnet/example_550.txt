Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that it's purely about code formatting. Both versions contain the exact same parameters and method signature, with the only difference being that one version (the HEAD version) has the method parameters on two lines, while the other (the incoming change from commit 1d97bfac) has them on a single line.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
        }

        return definition;
    }

    public static List<Class> getAllResources(Application application, List<Class> resources) {
        List<Class> allResources = new ArrayList<>();
        if (application != null) {
            if (application.getClasses() != null) {
                allResources.addAll(application.getClasses());
            }

```

I chose the single-line parameter version as it appears to be the newer change and is more consistent with modern Java formatting conventions.
