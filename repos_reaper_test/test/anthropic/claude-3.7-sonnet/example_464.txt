Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version includes a `serialVersionUID` declaration for the anonymous inner class extending `ResourceServlet`, while the other branch (b26c4f8ba13ab0d64627d01dcbba50609ff04a4f) has removed it.

The `serialVersionUID` is important for serialization compatibility. Since it's explicitly defined in HEAD, it suggests the developer intended to control serialization versioning, which is generally a good practice for serializable classes.

Here's my resolution:

```java
        return new DefaultResourceLoader();
    }

    private ResourceServlet concreteResourceServlet(final String location) {
        return new ResourceServlet() {
            private static final long serialVersionUID = 4602656496188884537L;
			{
                setApplyLastModified(true);
                setContentType("image/png");
            }


```

I've kept the `serialVersionUID` declaration because it's better for serialization compatibility and doesn't interfere with the functionality of the code.
