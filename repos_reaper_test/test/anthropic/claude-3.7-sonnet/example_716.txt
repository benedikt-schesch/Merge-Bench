Looking at the merge conflict, one side is releasing a media player from a collection `mMediaPlayers` indexed by `mPreparedQuery` and also removing it from `mBufferedMediaPlayers`. The other side simply releases a media player instance directly referenced by `sMediaPlayer` without any collection management.

Given the context appears to be managing multiple media players in collections on the HEAD side, while the other branch has a simpler implementation, I'll resolve by keeping the more comprehensive implementation from HEAD.

```java
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void release() {
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.remove(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null) {
            sMediaPlayer.release();
            mBufferedMediaPlayers.remove(sMediaPlayer);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public long getPosition() {

```
