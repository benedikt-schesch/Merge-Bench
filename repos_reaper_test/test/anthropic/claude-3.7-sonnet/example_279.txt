Looking at this code, I see a simple merge conflict that only involves whitespace. Both sides of the merge have an empty line between `toPkgr.setSameMapKeyType(isSameKeyType);` and the `if (pkCount != total) {` block, but they're represented slightly differently.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
            toPkgr.addPackager(cpkgr);
            pkCount = 1;
        }

        toPkgr.setSameMapKeyType(isSameKeyType);

        if (pkCount != total) {
            int errCode = 2146;
            String msg = "Internal Error. Inconsistency in key index found during optimization.";
            throw new OptimizerException(msg, errCode, PigException.BUG);
        }
```
