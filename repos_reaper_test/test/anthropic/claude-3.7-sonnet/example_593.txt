Looking at this merge conflict, it seems there's a change in the method name used to add elements to the JSON object and the corresponding exception type that's caught.

Based on the semantic intent:
- One side is using `add` method and catching a `ParseException`
- The other side is using `put` method and catching a `JsonException`

Since JSON libraries commonly use `put` rather than `add` for adding key-value pairs, and the exception change seems to align with this method change, I'll resolve the conflict with the newer implementation.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
          "Provided queries must have non-blank keys and values. You provided: " + queries);
      }

      try {
        jsonObject.put(trimToEmpty(entry.getKey()), trimToEmpty(entry.getValue()));
      } catch (JsonException e) {
        // Shouldn't happen unless bizarre input is provided
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unable to convert " + queries + " to JSON.", e);
      }
    }

```
