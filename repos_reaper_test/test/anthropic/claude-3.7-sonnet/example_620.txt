Looking at the merge conflict, it appears that the HEAD version has removed the import statement for `com.restfb.types.Checkin.Place.Location`, while the other branch (a17acec) includes it. Since this is just an import statement, I'll preserve the import as it's likely needed somewhere in the code. The second conflict is just about line spacing, where HEAD has an extra blank line at the end.

```java
import com.restfb.Facebook;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper;
import com.restfb.JsonMapper.JsonMappingCompleted;
import com.restfb.exception.FacebookJsonMappingException;
import com.restfb.json.JsonObject;
import com.restfb.types.Checkin.Place.Location;
import com.restfb.util.DateUtils;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Date;
