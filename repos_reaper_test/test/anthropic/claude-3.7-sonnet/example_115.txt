Looking at this merge conflict, I see that both sides are importing `ExpectedException`, but from different packages. Additionally, the "ours" side (HEAD) doesn't import `Fail`, while the "theirs" side does. Since the code is testing `Fail#failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown`, the `Fail` import is necessary, and based on the comment in the code, it appears to be testing the class in the `org.fest.assertions.api` package.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
import static org.fest.util.ExpectedException.none;

import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;

import org.fest.assertions.api.Fail;
import org.fest.assertions.test.ExpectedException;

/**
 * Tests for <code>{@link Fail#failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(Class)}</code>.
