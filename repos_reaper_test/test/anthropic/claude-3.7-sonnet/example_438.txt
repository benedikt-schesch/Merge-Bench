Looking at this merge conflict, it seems that both sides are adding new constants to the same class. On the HEAD side, two constants for palette configuration are added, while on the 308db82 side, a constant for library update action is added. The intents are different and not conflicting semantically, so I'll include all three constants.

```java

    public static final String PREFS_USER_KEY = "user";
    public static final String PREFS_PASSWORD_KEY = "password";

    public static final String VIDEO_UPDATE_ACTION = "videoUpdateAction";
    public static final String LIBRARY_UPDATED_ACTION = "libraryUpdatedAction";

    public static final String PALETTE_VISIBILITY = "paletteVisibility";
    public static final String PALETTE_VIBRANCY = "paletteVibrancy";
}
```
