I'll resolve this merge conflict by considering the intent of both sides, which is to assert that the `connection` is not null. The two sides use different assertion methods with the same semantics.

```java
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_reachAllElements() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();
    assertThat(connection).isNotNull();

    int counter = 0;
    for (List<FacebookType> page : connection) {
      for (FacebookType type : page) {
        counter++;

```

I chose the `assertThat(connection).isNotNull()` version as it's using the fluent assertion style which is generally preferred in modern Java testing, but both assertions have the same intent.
