Looking at this merge conflict, I can see the issue is around the declaration of variables `className` and `funcSpec`. One side declares `className` and initializes `funcSpec` to null, while the other side declares both variables separately and explicitly sets both to null. Also, there's a difference in the type of `funcSpec` - one side treats it as a `String`, the other as a `FuncSpec`.

Given the context, and seeing that `funcSpec` is later used and retrieved from `definedFunctions.get(alias)`, it seems more likely that `FuncSpec` is the correct type rather than `String`. I'll resolve the conflict accordingly:

```java

    }
    
    
    public Class getClassForAlias(String alias) throws IOException{
        String className = null;
        FuncSpec funcSpec = null;
        if (definedFunctions != null) {
            funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias);
        }
        if (funcSpec != null) {
