Looking at this merge conflict, it appears that one branch (HEAD) has added a new `run()` method, while the other branch (1488b22...) doesn't have this method. The conflict marker is around the method implementation. Since this is adding a completely new method and the other branch doesn't have conflicting changes to it, I'll resolve by keeping the new method.

```java
        if (in != null)
        {
            parser = new GruntParser(in);
            parser.setParams(pig);    
        }
    }

    public void run() {
    parser.setInteractive(true);
    parser.parseContOnError();
    }

    public void setConsoleReader(ConsoleReader c)
    {
        parser.setConsoleReader(c);

```
