Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are providing identical semantics but with slightly different formatting in the JavaDoc. I'll resolve this by keeping the complete documentation but maintaining consistent formatting.

```java
    /**
     * Returns the given string if it is non-null; the empty string otherwise.
     * 
     * @param string
     *            the string to test and possibly return
     * @return {@code string} itself if it is non-null; {@code ""} if it is
     *         null.
     */
    public static String nullToEmpty(String string) {
        return (string == null) ? "" : string;
    }

```
