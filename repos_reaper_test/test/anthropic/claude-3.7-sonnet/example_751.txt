After analyzing the merge conflict, I need to resolve it by determining the correct imports to include. In this case, it appears that one branch added several imports related to Yahoo Labs Samoa, and the other branch removed them but added different imports.

Based on the code context, it seems the intent is to include a comprehensive set of imports for the Samoa project. Therefore, I'll merge all the unique imports from both sides.

```java
import java.util.List;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.instances.Instances;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.learners.Learner;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.Stream;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.topology.TopologyBuilder;
import com.github.javacliparser.ClassOption;
import com.github.javacliparser.Configurable;
import com.github.javacliparser.IntOption;
import com.yahoo.labs.samoa.core.Processor;

```
