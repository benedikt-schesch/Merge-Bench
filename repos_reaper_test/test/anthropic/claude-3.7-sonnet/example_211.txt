Looking at the merge conflict, it appears that one side of the merge (HEAD) has an empty line after the Apache License 2.0 header, while the other side (1488b22...) doesn't have this empty line before starting the Apache License 1.1 header.

Since this is just a matter of whitespace between license header blocks, and preserving both licenses seems to be the intent, I'll resolve it by keeping the empty line for better readability between the license blocks:
