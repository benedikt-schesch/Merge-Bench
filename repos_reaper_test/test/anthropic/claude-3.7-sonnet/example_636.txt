Looking at the merge conflict, it seems that one side (HEAD) added a `serialVersionUID` field for the `AgeRange` class, while the other side (a17acec) doesn't include it. Since adding a serialVersionUID is a good practice for serializable classes that extend `AbstractFacebookType`, and it doesn't interfere with any other functionality, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the serialVersionUID.

```java

  }

  public static class AgeRange extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * The lower bounds of the range for this person's age.
     * 
     * @return The lower bounds of the range for this person's age.
     */

```
