Looking at this merge conflict, I need to combine two different import statements:
1. From the HEAD, there's an import for `org.spout.math.vector.Vector3`
2. From the other branch, there's an import for `org.spout.api.Client`

Since these are separate imports that don't conflict functionally, I'll include both:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

import org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.HashCodeBuilder;

import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.Client;
import org.spout.api.Platform;
import org.spout.api.Spout;
import org.spout.api.component.BaseComponentOwner;
import org.spout.api.component.Component;
import org.spout.api.component.entity.EntityComponent;
```
