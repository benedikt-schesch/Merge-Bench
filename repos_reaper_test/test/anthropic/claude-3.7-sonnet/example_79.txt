Looking at this merge conflict, I see that both sides are defining the same method, but the HEAD version has the `public` modifier while the other version doesn't have it. 

Since this is an interface method, the `public` modifier is implicitly applied to all methods in an interface by default in Java, meaning both versions are functionally identical. The more concise version (without the redundant `public` modifier) is generally preferred in modern Java code.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
   */
  public interface Localizable {
    /**
     * @return The user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     */
    String getString();
  }

  /**
   * Enums that implement this interface have two user-visible strings associated with them.
   * <p>
```
