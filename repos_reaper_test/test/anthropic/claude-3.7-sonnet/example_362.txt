Looking at both changes, I can see that both versions are trying to create an HTTP request to the same URL, but they differ in how the request is created and how the parser is added. Here's the resolved version:

```java
   * @throws HttpResponseException if the authentication response has an error code
   * @throws IOException some other kind of I/O exception
   */
  public TokenInfoResponse requestTokenInfo() throws IOException {
    HttpTransport authSubTransport = this.authSubTransport;
    HttpRequest request = authSubTransport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(
        new GenericUrl("https://www.google.com/accounts/AuthSubTokenInfo"));
    request.addParser(AuthKeyValueParser.INSTANCE);
    return request.execute().parseAs(TokenInfoResponse.class);
  }

  /** Updates the authorization headers. */
  private void updateAuthorizationHeaders() {

```
