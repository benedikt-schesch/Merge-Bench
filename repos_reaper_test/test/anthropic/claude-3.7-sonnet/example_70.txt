Looking at the code snippet, I see a merge conflict where the two branches are returning an empty ArrayList but with different type specifications. Let me analyze the intent:

1. The HEAD version returns `new ArrayList<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>(0)` - specifying a fully typed empty ArrayList
2. The other branch returns `new ArrayList<>(0)` - using the diamond operator for type inference

The surrounding context suggests both are returning a list in response to a player's hand. Since the method presumably returns a List of WhiteCardData objects (based on the `getWhiteCardData(hand)` call above), the simplified version with type inference is likely sufficient and in line with modern Java practices.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
      final List<WhiteCard> hand = player.getHand();
      synchronized (hand) {
        return getWhiteCardData(hand);
      }
    } else {
      return new ArrayList<>(0);
    }
  }

  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
```
