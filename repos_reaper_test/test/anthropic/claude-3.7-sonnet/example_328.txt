Looking at this merge conflict, one side is trying to use a `PullToRefreshListView` while the other side uses a standard `ListView`. This looks like a UI component change where one branch upgrades to a pull-to-refresh variant of the list view.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

	@Override
	protected void setupState() {
		setTitle(getActivityTitle());

		mUserList = (PullToRefreshListView) findViewById(R.id.follower_list);

		setupListHeader(true);

		mUserListAdapter = new UserArrayAdapter(this);
		mUserList.setAdapter(mUserListAdapter);

```

I chose the `PullToRefreshListView` from the HEAD branch as it appears to be an enhancement over the basic `ListView`, adding pull-to-refresh functionality which is a common UI pattern.
