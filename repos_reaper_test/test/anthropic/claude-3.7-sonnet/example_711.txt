Looking at this merge conflict, one side adds a constant `CHUNK_SIZE` with value 50, while the other side doesn't have this addition. Since this is a constant declaration and doesn't appear to conflict with any existing code, I'll resolve by keeping the constant.

```java

    public static final int FALSE = 0;

    public static final int TRUE = 1;

    public static final int CHUNK_SIZE = 50;

    private static class Holder {

        private static final DatabaseHelper instance = new DatabaseHelper();

    }

```
