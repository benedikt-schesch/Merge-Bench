Looking at this merge conflict, I see two versions of the same method declaration, with the only difference being a space before the opening curly brace. This is purely a formatting difference without any semantic conflict.

Here's the resolution:

```java

  protected ByteAssert(Byte actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ByteAssert.class, description);
  }

  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```

I resolved the conflict by keeping the version with the space between `)` and `{`, which follows standard Java formatting conventions and matches the style in the `protected ByteAssert` constructor above it.
