Looking at the merge conflict, I see that the difference is between using `dataItem` and `dataList` as the argument to the `unmodifiableList` method. Based on the code context, this is assigning to the `this.data` field.

The conflict is about which variable name to use as the source data for this connection object's data. Since I don't have the full context to determine which variable name is correct, I will resolve this based on naming conventions and the surrounding code.

Looking at the method signature and class context, it seems like `dataList` is the more appropriate variable name for a collection that would be turned into an unmodifiable list. The variable name `dataList` suggests a collection of items, which aligns with the purpose of `unmodifiableList()`.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
      totalCount = jsonSummary.get("total_count") != null ? jsonSummary.getLong("total_count", 0L) : null;
    } else {
      totalCount = null;
    }

    this.data = unmodifiableList(dataList);
    this.facebookClient = facebookClient;
    this.connectionType = connectionType;
  }
