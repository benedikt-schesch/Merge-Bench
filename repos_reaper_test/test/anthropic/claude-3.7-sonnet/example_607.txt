After analyzing the merge conflict, I can see that one side adds a `serialVersionUID` field declaration while the other side removes it. In this case, it's generally safer to keep the serialVersionUID field as it helps with serialization compatibility. Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class Engagement extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * Number of people who like this.
     * 
     * @return Number of people who like this
     */
```
