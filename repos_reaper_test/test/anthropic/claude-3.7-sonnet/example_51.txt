Based on the merge conflict, I can see that the difference is in the generic type declaration for the `ArrayList` constructor. The first version has an explicit type parameter `<Player>`, while the second version uses the diamond operator `<>` which is a Java 7+ feature that allows type inference.

The diamond operator is the more modern approach and helps reduce code verbosity while maintaining the same type safety. This change appears to be a simple code style improvement.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    }
    return info;
  }

  public final List<Player> getPlayers() {
    final List<Player> copy = new ArrayList<>(players.size());
    copy.addAll(players);
    return copy;
  }

  /**
```

I chose the newer style with the diamond operator `<>` as it represents a modernization of the codebase without changing any functionality.
