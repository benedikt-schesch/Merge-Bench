Looking at this merge conflict, I see that the only difference is indentation. The HEAD version has less indentation (uses 4 spaces) while the incoming change (d54360...) uses more indentation (6 spaces). The actual logic is identical.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    public ProtocolVersionCB(final Channel chan) {
      this.chan = chan;
    }

    public Long call(final Object response) throws Exception {
      if (response instanceof VersionMismatchException) {
        if (server_version == SERVER_VERSION_UNKNWON) {
          // If we get here, it's because we tried to handshake with a server
          // running HBase 0.92 or above, but using a pre-0.92 handshake.  So
          // we know we have to handshake differently.
          server_version = SERVER_VERSION_092_OR_ABOVE;

```

I chose the formatting from the newer version (6 spaces indentation) as it appears to be consistent with the indentation used in the constructor above (2-space increments).
