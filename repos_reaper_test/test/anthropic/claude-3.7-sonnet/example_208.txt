Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that one side adds a `Session session;` declaration with indentation, while the other side removes it but has the same declaration right after the conflict (with different spacing). Since both sides essentially want to have a `Session session;` field, I'll resolve it by keeping the declaration from after the conflict.

```java
 *
 */
public class SSHSocketImplFactory implements SocketImplFactory, Logger {
    
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(SSHSocketImplFactory.class);

    Session session;

    public static SSHSocketImplFactory getFactory() throws JSchException, IOException {
        return getFactory(System.getProperty("ssh.gateway"));

```
