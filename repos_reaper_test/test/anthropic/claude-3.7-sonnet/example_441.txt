I'll resolve this merge conflict for you:

```java
        securityCodeText.setOnFocusChangeListener(l);
        zipCodeText.setOnFocusChangeListener(l);
    }

    public void focusOnField(final CreditEntryFieldBase field) {
        if (this.textHelper != null) {
            this.textHelper.setText(field.getHelperText());
        }
        focusOnField(field, null);
    }

    public void focusOnField(final CreditEntryFieldBase field, String initialFieldValue) {
        field.requestFocus();
        if(!scrolling) {
            scrolling = true;

```

The resolution combines both changes. The HEAD version was setting the helper text when focusing on a field. The incoming change was overloading the method to add support for an initial field value. The resolved version keeps the helper text functionality and also calls the overloaded method with a null initial value, preserving both intents.
