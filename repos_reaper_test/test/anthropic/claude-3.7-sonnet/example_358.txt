Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to parse a response, but the implementation approaches differ. Let me resolve this conflict:

```java
  public final String getContentType() {
    return contentType;
  }

  public <T> T parse(HttpResponse response, Class<T> dataClass) throws IOException {
    return parserForResponse(jsonFactory, response).parseAndClose(dataClass, null);
  }

  /**
   * Returns a JSON parser to use for parsing the given HTTP response.
   * <p>

```

I chose the second implementation because:
1. It uses a `jsonFactory` parameter which is likely a class field
2. The newer version seems to have a more direct approach, calling the parser and parse methods in a single chain
3. The file path in the newer version includes "main/java" which suggests it follows newer project structure conventions
