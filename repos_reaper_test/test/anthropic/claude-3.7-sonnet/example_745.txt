Looking at this merge conflict, I see that both sides are trying to include a comment about positioning the widget. The difference is only in capitalization - the HEAD version uses lowercase "position" while the c9237517 commit version uses uppercase "Position".

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
        mOpenWidgets.add(widget);

        // Make sure the widget is properly oriented
        widget.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientation, true);

        // Position it properly
        widget.forceFinalY(mTotalHeight - WIDGETS_MARGIN);
        widget.setY(mTotalHeight - WIDGETS_MARGIN);
        mTotalHeight += widget.getMeasuredHeight() + mSpacing;
    }

```

I chose the version with the capitalized "Position" as it follows proper sentence capitalization for comments.
