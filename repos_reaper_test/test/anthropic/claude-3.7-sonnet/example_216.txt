Looking at this merge conflict, I notice it's simply about whitespace between two methods. The HEAD version has no empty line after the closing brace of the current method, while the other version (1488b22) includes an empty line before the next method.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
            Tuple t = (Tuple)it.next();
            Double first = Double.valueOf(t.get(0).toString());
            Double second = Double.valueOf(t.get(1).toString());
            assertTrue(first.compareTo(second) < 0);
        }
        
    }

    
    @Test
    public void testNumericGte() throws Throwable {

```

I've resolved this by keeping the empty line from the 1488b22 branch, as it provides better readability with consistent spacing between methods.
