Looking at the merge conflict, I need to decide which string value to keep for `logConnectFail`. This is a simple change where one branch uses "Connect failed" and the other uses "Connection failed".

```java
  private final String logAlreadyScanning = "Scanning already in progress";
  private final String logScanStartFail = "Scan failed to start";
  private final String logNotScanning = "Not scanning";
  //Connection
  private final String logPreviouslyConnected = "Device previously connected, reconnect or close for new device";
  private final String logConnectFail = "Connection failed";
  private final String logNeverConnected = "Never connected to device";
  private final String logIsNotConnected = "Device isn't connected";
  private final String logIsNotDisconnected = "Device isn't disconnected";
  private final String logIsDisconnected = "Device is disconnected";
  private final String logNoAddress = "No device address";

```

I've resolved the conflict in favor of "Connection failed" as it appears to be a more specific and grammatically complete error message that better matches the style of other log messages in this collection.
