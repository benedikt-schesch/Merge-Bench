Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that there are two differences:

1. The `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation in the HEAD version
2. The `@Test` annotation placement - in the HEAD it's at class level, while in the incoming change it's at method level

The most likely correct resolution is to take the method-level `@Test` annotation (which is standard in JUnit) while preserving the `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
>>>>>>> a647950590fa8dec1925101321699283f22a8bff

@Test
public class HelpTest
{
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    @Test
    public void testGit()
    {
        CliBuilder<Runnable> builder = Cli.<Runnable>builder("git")
                .withDescription("the stupid content tracker")
                .withDefaultCommand(Help.class)
                .withCommands(Help.class,

```
