Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that the incoming change (1488b22c) is trying to add the import for `org.junit.Test`, while the current branch (HEAD) doesn't have this import. Since JUnit contains both the older framework (junit.framework.TestCase) and the newer annotations like @Test, it makes sense to include both imports as they would be used for different testing approaches.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
import java.util.Properties;

import junit.framework.TestCase;

import org.junit.Test;

import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;
import org.apache.pig.EvalFunc;
import org.apache.pig.FuncSpec;
import org.apache.pig.LoadFunc;
```
