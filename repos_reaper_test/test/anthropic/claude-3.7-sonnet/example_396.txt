Looking at the merge conflict, I can see both sides are trying to initialize the `filterList` with a `RegexFileFilter`, but they differ in how they obtain the filter file's location. The HEAD version uses a helper method `getFilterFile` while the other version directly constructs the path. Additionally, HEAD initializes a `testNGConfigurator` that isn't present in the other version.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    {
        checkNotNull(environment, "No runtime environment is configured. Maybe because the project has no jdk.");

        runtimeEnvironment = environment;
        this.eventQueue = eventQueue;
        File filterFile = getFilterFile(environment);
        filterList = new RegexFileFilter(filterFile);
        testNGConfigurator = new TestNGConfigurator(filterFile);
        runnerClass = MultiProcessRunner.class;
        controller = new SingleLockConcurrencyController();
    }

    /**
```

I chose the HEAD version because:
1. It uses a dedicated method `getFilterFile` which is likely to have better error handling or reusability
2. It includes initialization of `testNGConfigurator` which would be lost in the other version
3. The implementation appears cleaner as it delegates file path construction to a specific method
