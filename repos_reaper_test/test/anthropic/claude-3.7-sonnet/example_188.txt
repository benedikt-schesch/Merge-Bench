Looking at the merge conflict, the only difference is in the spacing between the `read` method and the `skip` method. Both sides have an empty line, but with potentially different whitespace characters. Since the intent is the same on both sides (to have a single blank line between methods), I'll resolve the conflict.

```java
    public int read(byte b[], int off, int len) throws IOException {
        int read = in.read(b, off, len);
        pos += read;
        return read;
    }

    @Override
    public long skip(long n) throws IOException {
        long rc = in.skip(n);
        pos += rc;
        return rc;
```
