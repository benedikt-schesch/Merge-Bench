Looking at the merge conflict, it seems that there are two different implementations of the `pause()` method. The first version calls `pause()` on the MediaPlayer associated with the prepared query, while the second version updates a playback state and calls `handlePlayState()`. These implementations appear to have different approaches to handling the pause action.

Without more context about the overall architecture or the `handlePlayState()` method, it's difficult to determine the correct merge. Both sides seem to have valid intent, but I don't have enough information to safely combine them.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
>>>>>>> ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66
    }

    @Override
    public void pause() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        MediaPlayer sMediaPlayer = mMediaPlayers.get(mPreparedQuery);
        if (sMediaPlayer != null)
            sMediaPlayer.pause();
=======
        mPlayState = PlaybackStateCompat.STATE_PAUSED;
        handlePlayState();
>>>>>>> ab8ddfc2d347e46622cd1d2bd517db3312181b66
    }

    @Override
    public void seekTo(long msec) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
```
