Based on the code snippet, there's a merge conflict between the HEAD version and a commit (f6a8f7aa42cae344f71cc6759f1c7880b49211fc). The conflict involves adding a new method `getPigContext()` that returns the `pigContext` object. This appears to be a straightforward addition of functionality that wasn't in the HEAD version, and it doesn't appear to conflict with any existing code. The semantics seem to be to provide access to the `pigContext` object, marked as `@Private`.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    @Private
    public PigContext getPigContext() {
        return pigContext;
    }

    public void start() {
        startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        userId = System.getProperty("user.name");
    }

```
