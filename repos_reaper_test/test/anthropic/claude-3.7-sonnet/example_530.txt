Looking at this merge conflict, the difference is in using `null` versus `nil` to check if the node `z` is empty before returning its value. The rest of the code is identical.

In Java, `null` is a keyword representing a null reference, while `nil` would be a variable (presumably a constant defined elsewhere in the class to represent an empty/null node). Since the conflict is returning `null` in both cases when the condition is true, the correct resolution depends on the codebase's conventions.

Based on the context and the presence of a null check in the next method (`if (u == null)`), the most likely intent is to use the class's established convention for representing empty nodes.

```java
				w = w.right;
			} else {
				return w.x;
			}
		}
		return z == nil ? null : z.x;
	}

	public T findGE(T u) {
		if (u == null) { // find the minimum value
			Node w = r;

```

I resolved with the `nil` version since it's more likely this is a Red-Black Tree or similar data structure where `nil` is a sentinel node that represents empty/null nodes in the tree structure.
