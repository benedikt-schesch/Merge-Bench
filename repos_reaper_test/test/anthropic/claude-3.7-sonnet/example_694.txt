Based on the merge conflict, I need to resolve two different versions of code in the "fire-event" case handling, where the HEAD version includes additional code for the "inline-text-message" case that isn't present in the other version.

Looking at the semantics, it appears that the HEAD version has added a new case handling for "inline-text-message" notifications with delay settings, which is completely missing in the other version.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
					out.append(" data-structr-failure-notifications-custom-dialog-element=\"").append(generateDataAttributesForIdList(renderContext, triggeredAction, ActionMapping.failureNotificationElements)).append("\"");
					break;

				case "fire-event":
					out.append(" data-structr-failure-notifications-event=\"").append(triggeredAction.getProperty(ActionMapping.failureNotificationsEventProperty)).append("\"");
					break;

				case "inline-text-message":
					final Integer delay = triggeredAction.getProperty(StructrApp.key(ActionMapping.class, "failureNotificationsDelay"));
					out.append(" data-structr-failure-notifications-delay=\"").append(delay.toString()).append("\"");
					break;

				default:
					break;

```
