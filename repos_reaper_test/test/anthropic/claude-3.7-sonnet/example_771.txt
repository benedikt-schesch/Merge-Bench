Examining this merge conflict, I can see that the `d543609` branch introduces a new field `at_timestamp_only` with a default value, while the HEAD branch doesn't include this field. Since this addition doesn't conflict with any code changes in HEAD (just whitespace), I should preserve the new field:

```java

  /** Special value for {@link #family} when deleting a whole row.  */
  static final byte[] WHOLE_ROW = new byte[0];

  private final byte[][] qualifiers;

  /** Whether to delete the value only at the specified timestamp. */
  private boolean at_timestamp_only = false;

  /**
   * Constructor to delete an entire row.
   * <strong>These byte arrays will NOT be copied.</strong>
   * @param table The table to edit.

```
