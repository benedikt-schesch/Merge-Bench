Looking at this merge conflict, it's a simple difference between using double quotes `"."` versus single quotes `'.'` for the same character literal in the `lastIndexOf()` method. Both versions achieve the same result since Java treats single and double quotes differently (single quotes for char literals, double quotes for strings).

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    if (binaryAttachment.getFieldName() != null) {
      return binaryAttachment.getFieldName();
    }

    String name = binaryAttachment.getFilename();
    int fileExtensionIndex = name.lastIndexOf('.');
    return fileExtensionIndex > 0 ? name.substring(0, fileExtensionIndex) : name;
  }

  /**
   * returns if the binary attachment stream is closed automatically
```

I resolved the conflict by choosing the single quote version (`'.'`) since it's more semantically correct in Java to use char literals with single quotes when looking for a single character. This is also the version from the newer commit (a17acec0).
