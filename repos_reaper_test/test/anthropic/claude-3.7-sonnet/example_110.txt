Looking at this merge conflict, I see one side is importing specific classes `Employee` and `Name` from `org.fest.test` individually, while the other side is using a wildcard import `org.fest.test.*`. The intent is the same in both cases - to include necessary classes from the `org.fest.test` package.

Since the wildcard import (from the right side) already includes all classes, including `Employee` and `Name`, the wildcard import is more comprehensive and I'll resolve the conflict by choosing it:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

import java.beans.PropertyDescriptor;
import java.util.*;

import org.fest.test.*;
import org.fest.util.IntrospectionError;
import org.junit.*;

/**
 * Tests for <code>{@link PropertySupport#propertyValues(String, Collection)}</code>.

```
