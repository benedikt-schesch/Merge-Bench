Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to invoke a constructor with arguments, but they're using different approaches to convert the `args` object to an array.

The HEAD version uses `args.toArray()`, which suggests `args` is a Collection type.
The incoming change (1488b22) uses `(Object[])args`, which suggests `args` is already an array but needs casting to Object[].

Since they're doing effectively the same operation in different ways, I need to choose the approach that matches the actual type of `args`. Without seeing the declaration of `args`, I'll preserve the conflict.

```java
                for (int i = 0; i < paramTypes.length; i++) {
                    paramTypes[i] = String.class;
                }
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(paramTypes);
<<<<<<< HEAD
                ret =  c.newInstance(args.toArray());
=======
                ret =  c.newInstance((Object[])args);
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
            } else {
                ret = objClass.newInstance();
            }
        }
        catch(NoSuchMethodException nme) {
```
