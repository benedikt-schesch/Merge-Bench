Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class Settings extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String setting;

```

The intent here is clear - one side (HEAD) wants to add the serialVersionUID field which is a standard practice for serializable classes extending AbstractFacebookType, while the other side doesn't have this addition. The serialVersionUID should be kept to ensure proper serialization/deserialization behavior, so I've preserved it in the merged code.
