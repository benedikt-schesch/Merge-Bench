Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are importing `org.spout.api.plugin.PluginManager`, but in different locations. The incoming change (from 67bcb76a) adds this import between `Skeleton` and `Plugin`, while HEAD already has this import after `Plugin`. Since duplicated imports are unnecessary, I'll resolve this by keeping just one instance.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import org.spout.api.material.BlockMaterial;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.model.Model;
import org.spout.api.model.animation.Animation;
import org.spout.api.model.animation.Skeleton;
import org.spout.api.plugin.Plugin;
import org.spout.api.plugin.PluginManager;
import org.spout.api.protocol.ServerNetworkSynchronizer;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Session;


```
