Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's about importing `java.util.List` in the code. The conflict is fairly straightforward - one version (HEAD) doesn't include the List import, while the other version (1488b22) adds it.

Since imports don't typically cause conflicts in functionality and having an unused import is generally less problematic than missing a needed one, I'll resolve by keeping the List import.

```java
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Stack;
import java.util.Properties ;

import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
