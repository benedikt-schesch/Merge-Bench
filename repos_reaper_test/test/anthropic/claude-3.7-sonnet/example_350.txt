Looking at the merge conflict, I need to analyze the intent of both sides:

1. HEAD version uses `responseException` to check for a null detail and asserts the exact message.
2. The incoming change (47d0018) uses `ge` variable (which doesn't appear in the context) and only checks that the message starts with "200".

Since `ge` doesn't appear in the visible context but seems to be trying to reference the exception, I'm going to use the variable `responseException` which is properly defined. The intent appears to be testing the same object, but with slightly different assertions.

```java
        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "200\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
  }

  public void testFrom_withDetails() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport();
    HttpRequest request =
