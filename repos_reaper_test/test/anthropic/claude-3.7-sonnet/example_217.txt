Here's the resolved code snippet in Markdown code syntax:

```java
        assertEquals(expectedCount, count);
    }

    @Test
    public void testStringLte() throws Throwable {
        PigServer pig = new PigServer(initString);
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("test", "txt");
        PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(tmpFile));
        int expectedCount = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < LOOP_COUNT; i++) {
            if(i % 5 == 0) {
```

I resolved the merge conflict by adopting the change from the incoming version (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309), which adds the line initializing a PigServer instance. This is likely necessary for the test to function properly, as it appears to be setting up the test environment.
