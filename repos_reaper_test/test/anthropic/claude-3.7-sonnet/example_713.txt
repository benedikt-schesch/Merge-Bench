Looking at the merge conflict, I see that one side implements direct playback control using MediaPlayer, while the other side introduces a state management pattern. Here's the resolved code:

```java
        EventBus.getDefault().register(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void play() {
        mPlayState = PlaybackStateCompat.STATE_PLAYING;
        handlePlayState();
    }

    @Override
    public void pause() {
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

I've chosen the second implementation (from ab8ddfc2) because it appears to be introducing a more structured state-based approach to playback control, which likely handles the MediaPlayer operations inside the `handlePlayState()` method. This approach is typically more maintainable and allows for better state tracking across the application.
