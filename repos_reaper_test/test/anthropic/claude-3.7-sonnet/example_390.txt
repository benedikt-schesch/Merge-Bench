Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are implementing the same test, but with opposite intentions and results:

1. The current branch (HEAD) is implementing a test called `shouldRespondToPostChangeEvents()`
2. The incoming branch (ee2493...) is implementing a test called `shouldNotRespondToPostChangeEvents()` with an explanatory comment

The key issue is the test's purpose - one expects it to respond to post change events, while the other doesn't. Since there's an explanatory comment in the incoming branch and the code below the conflict actually tests that the processor cannot process the event (`assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event))`), the incoming branch's intent matches the actual test implementation.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

	@Test
	public void shouldNotRespondToPostChangeEvents() {
		// Not sure why we wanted to respond to change events, seems better to respond to the post build event, once the build is finished
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, POST_CHANGE, AUTO_BUILD, null);
		assertFalse(processor.canProcessEvent(event));

		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

```
