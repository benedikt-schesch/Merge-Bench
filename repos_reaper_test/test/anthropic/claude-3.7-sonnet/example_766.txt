Looking at the merge conflict, I see that the HEAD version has added two lines to set `this.family` and `this.qualifiers`, while the branch represented by 482c3930 has removed these lines (or never had them).

However, analyzing the context before the conflict, I notice that if there are no specific qualifiers to delete, `this.qualifiers` is already being set to `DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER`. The first line in the HEAD version seems redundant since it's setting `this.family = family` without any conditions, and the second line is actually redundant with the code in the if-else statement that's already setting `this.qualifiers`.

The most appropriate resolution is to keep the HEAD version as it explicitly sets both fields, even though there's redundancy:

```java
    } else {
      // No specific qualifier to delete: delete the entire family.  Not that
      // if `family == null', we'll delete and setting this is harmless.
      this.qualifiers = DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER;
    }
    this.family = family;
    this.qualifiers = qualifiers == null ? DELETE_FAMILY_MARKER : qualifiers;
    this.lockid = lockid;
  }

  @Override
  public byte[] table() {
```
