Looking at this merge conflict, I see that one side is importing the `ExecType` enum as a static import from `PigServer`, while the other side is importing the `ExecType` class directly. The best resolution would be to keep both imports since they appear to be referring to different things (an enum inside `PigServer` vs a separate class).

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

package org.apache.pig.test;

import static org.apache.pig.PigServer.ExecType.MAPREDUCE;
import org.apache.pig.ExecType;
import org.apache.pig.PigServer;

import org.apache.pig.data.DataType;
import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;
