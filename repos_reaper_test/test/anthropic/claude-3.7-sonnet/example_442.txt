Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine the intent of both sides.

One side is drawing a bitmap from the scene's viewport directly onto the canvas, while the other is delegating the drawing responsibility to the scene object via a `draw` method. The latter approach seems to be encapsulating the drawing logic within the scene class, which is generally good practice (favoring encapsulation).

Given that both approaches attempt to render the scene, I'll resolve by keeping the newer approach that uses the `scene.draw(canvas)` method:

```java
		
		// tell the scene to update it's viewport bitmap
		scene.update();
		
		// draw it
		scene.draw(canvas);
    	if (DEBUG){
    		long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
			double n = ((double)now)/1000L;
			double s = ((double)startTime)/1000L;
			double fps = 1L/(n-s);
```
