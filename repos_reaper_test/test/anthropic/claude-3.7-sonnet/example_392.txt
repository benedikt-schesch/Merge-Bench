Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that it involves a setup method for a test class. The two branches are making different changes to the method signature and the initialization of `updatedFiles`. Analyzing the intent:

1. HEAD is using JUnit 5 style (`@BeforeEach` and no exception declaration)
2. The other branch is using JUnit 4 style (`@Before`, method is `public` and declares `IOException`)
3. HEAD initializes `updatedFiles` with `newArrayList()` while the other branch uses `new HashSet<>()`

Here's the resolved conflict:

```java
	private DefaultInfinitestCore core;
	private ChangeDetector changeDetector;
	private TestDetector testDetector;

	@BeforeEach
	void inContext() throws IOException {
		updatedFiles = new HashSet<>();
		core = new DefaultInfinitestCore(mock(TestRunner.class), new ControlledEventQueue());
		
		changeDetector = mock(ChangeDetector.class);
		when(changeDetector.findChangedFiles()).thenReturn(updatedFiles);
		core.setChangeDetector(changeDetector);
```

I chose `@BeforeEach` from HEAD which suggests a migration to JUnit 5, but kept the `throws IOException` and `HashSet<>()` initialization from the other branch as they seem to be important functional changes.
