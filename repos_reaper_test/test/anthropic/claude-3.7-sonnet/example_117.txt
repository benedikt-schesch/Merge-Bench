Here's the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax:

```java
  private void openCommits() {
    if (selectedBranch != null) {
      RepoInfo repoInfo = new RepoInfo();
      repoInfo.owner = repo.getOwner().getLogin();
      repoInfo.name = repo.name;
      repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getName();
      Intent intent = BranchCommitsActivity.createLauncherIntent(this, repoInfo);
      startActivity(intent);
    }
  }

```

I resolved the conflict by choosing the version from HEAD. The intent appears to be to set the branch name for the RepoInfo object. The HEAD version uses `selectedBranch.getName()` which gets the name of the branch, while the other version uses `selectedBranch.getCommit().getSha()` which gets the SHA of the commit. Since the variable name is `repoInfo.branch`, it makes more sense to use the branch name rather than the commit SHA.
