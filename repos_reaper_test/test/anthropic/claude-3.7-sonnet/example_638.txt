After analyzing the merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the `contentType` field and both are adding the `@Getter private String fieldName;` declaration. Looking at the semantics, one side initializes `contentType` to `null` explicitly while the other doesn't initialize it. Since both sides are adding the same `fieldName` field, I'll keep one copy.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java

  private byte[] data;

  private InputStream dataStream;

  private String contentType = null;

  @Getter
  private String fieldName;

  /**

```
