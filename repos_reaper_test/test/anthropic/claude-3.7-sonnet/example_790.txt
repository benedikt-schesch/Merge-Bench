Looking at the merge conflict, I need to resolve whether to use `new MultiAction(server_version)` or `new MultiAction()` based on the intent of both changes.

Based on the context, it appears one branch is adding a `server_version` parameter to the `MultiAction` constructor while the other is using the parameterless constructor. Since the version with the parameter appears to be adding more information, I'll resolve in favor of that one.

```java
      if (batch.size() < 1024) {  // XXX Don't hardcode.
        batch = null;  // We're going to buffer this edit for now.
      } else {
        // Execute the edits buffered so far.  But first we must clear
        // the reference to the buffer we're about to send to HBase.
        batched_rpcs = new MultiAction(server_version);
        addMultiActionCallbacks(batched_rpcs);
      }
    }

    if (schedule_flush) {

```
