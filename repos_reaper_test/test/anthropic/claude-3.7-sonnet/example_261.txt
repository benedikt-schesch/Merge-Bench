Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that both sides have the same line of code: `int hash = 7;`. The only difference appears to be indentation - the HEAD version uses 8 spaces for indentation, while the version from commit 88ae4a5fc1d6ff4a9d3c070fe2fc64a50827c37a uses a tab (or 4 spaces + tab).

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        int hash = 7;
        if (pkgr.getKeyTuple())
        {
            hash = hash * 31 + pkgr.getKeyAsTuple().hashCode();
        }
        else

```

I'm keeping the original indentation style from the HEAD version (8 spaces) as it matches the indentation of the surrounding code.
