I'll resolve this merge conflict based on the semantic intent of both sides.

```java
    
    /**
     * Find out if the bag is distinct.
     */
    boolean isDistinct();
    
    /**
     * Get an iterator to the bag. For default and distinct bags,
     * no particular order is guaranteed. For sorted bags the order
     * is guaranteed to be sorted according
```

The conflict involves the method signature of `isDistinct()`. One version has it as `public abstract boolean isDistinct()` while the other has it as just `boolean isDistinct()`. Since this appears to be in an interface or abstract class context (given the absence of a method body and presence of other abstract method descriptions), the `public abstract` modifiers are redundant in interfaces, as methods are implicitly public and abstract. Therefore, I've chosen the simpler form.
