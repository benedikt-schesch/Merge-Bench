Looking at this merge conflict, it seems to be a very simple case where the only difference between the two versions is trailing whitespace. The HEAD version has a trailing whitespace after `getLog(getClass());` while the version from commit 1488b22c doesn't have this whitespace.

Since whitespace differences rarely affect functionality in Java, here's the resolved snippet:

```java
import org.apache.pig.impl.util.WrappedIOException;

public class PigContext implements Serializable, FunctionInstantiator {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    
    private transient final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());
    
    public static final String JOB_NAME = "jobName";
    public static final String JOB_NAME_PREFIX= "PigLatin";
    
    /* NOTE: we only serialize some of the stuff 

```

I've chosen the version without the trailing whitespace (the 1488b22c version) as it's generally considered better practice to avoid unnecessary trailing whitespace.
