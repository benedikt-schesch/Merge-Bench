After analyzing the merge conflict, I can see that both sides are checking if the white deck has enough cards. The HEAD version uses an if-statement with a negative condition and returns true at the end, while the other version simplifies this into a single return statement with the positive condition. Semantically they achieve the same result, but the second approach is more concise.

```java
      if (tempBlackDeck.totalCount() < MINIMUM_BLACK_CARDS) {
        return false;
      }

      final WhiteDeck tempWhiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
      return tempWhiteDeck.totalCount() >= getRequiredWhiteCardCount();
    }
  }

  /**
   * Deal cards for this round. The game immediately then moves into the {@code PLAYING} state.
```
