Looking at this merge conflict, the only difference is a space after the `//` comment marker. The intent of both sides is the same - to create a comment noting that numInputs bags are being created. This is a trivial whitespace difference that doesn't affect functionality.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    public Result getNext() throws ExecException {
        if (bags == null) {
            return new Result(POStatus.STATUS_EOP, null);
        }

        // Create numInputs bags
        Object[] fields = new Object[mBags.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < mBags.length; i++) {
            if (mBags[i]) fields[i] = createDataBag(numBags);
        }

```

I chose the HEAD version with the space after the `//` as it aligns with common coding style conventions where a space typically follows comment markers.
