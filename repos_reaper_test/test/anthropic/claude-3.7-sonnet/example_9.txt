I'll resolve this merge conflict based on the semantics and intent. In this case, it appears that one side (HEAD) has added a `disconnected()` method, while the other side (0fe5af60) has removed it. Since removing this method could break functionality that depends on it, I'll preserve the method in the resolved version.

```java
			throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to add new world to the scheduler");
		}
		return world;
	}

	public void disconnected() {
		stop("Disconnected for some unknown reason!");
	}

	@Override
	public FileSystem getFileSystem() {
		return filesystem;
	}


```
