Looking at the merge conflict, it appears that one branch is defining a `PositionSendEvent.java` file with `Point` and `Quaternion` imports, while the other branch is defining a `BlockUpdateEvent.java` file with a `Chunk` import. The actual class defined in the code is `BlockUpdateEvent`, which matches the second branch.

Here's the resolved code with the appropriate imports for the `BlockUpdateEvent` class:

```java
 */
package org.spout.api.protocol.event;

import org.spout.api.event.HandlerList;
import org.spout.api.event.ProtocolEvent;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;

public class BlockUpdateEvent extends ProtocolEvent {
	private static final HandlerList handlers = new HandlerList();
	private final Chunk chunk;
	private final int x, y, z;

```
