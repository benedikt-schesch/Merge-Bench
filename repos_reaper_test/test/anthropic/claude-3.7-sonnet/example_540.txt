Looking at this merge conflict, the HEAD version contains additional code to reset the `isAdvertising` flag when the Bluetooth adapter is turning off, followed by closing the `gattServer` (with a comment explaining the null check). The incoming change (094cb482) only has the `gattServer` close logic without the advertising reset or comments.

The HEAD version appears to be more comprehensive by handling the advertising state, so I'll resolve in favor of that while preserving all the context.

```java

            if (initPeripheralCallback != null) initPeripheralCallback.sendPluginResult(pluginResult);

            break;
          case BluetoothAdapter.STATE_TURNING_OFF:
            // Reset isAdvertising when adapter is turning off
            if (isAdvertising) isAdvertising = false;

            // Make sure gattServer is not null (in case this triggers when it is null)
            if (gattServer != null) gattServer.close();
            break;
          case BluetoothAdapter.STATE_ON:

            addProperty(returnObj, keyStatus, statusEnabled);
