Looking at this merge conflict, I see two different ways of initializing the `log` variable, with the incoming change also adding a `firstTime` variable.

The HEAD version has:
- A non-static, final Log field initialized with the instance's class
- No `firstTime` variable

The incoming version has:
- A static, final Log field initialized with `Combine.class` explicitly
- Adds a static `firstTime` boolean with a comment about Hadoop combiners

Since this appears to be a combiner in a Hadoop context, the static approach with the `firstTime` flag seems more appropriate, as it accounts for the fact that combiners can be called multiple times.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
    public static JobContext sJobContext = null;

    public static class Combine
            extends Reducer<PigNullableWritable, NullableTuple, PigNullableWritable, Writable> {

        private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Combine.class);

        //HADOOP-3226 Combiners can be called multiple times in both map and reduce
        private static boolean firstTime = true;

        private byte keyType;

        //The reduce plan
        private PhysicalPlan cp;

```
