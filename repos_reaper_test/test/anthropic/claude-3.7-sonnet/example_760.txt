Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine whether to include the imports that were added in the remote branch (b471a97a0d79b8743a4aea305aa001474127e1b1).

Since these are imports for core classes that could be used in this package, and imports generally don't cause conflicts with existing functionality, it's reasonable to include them. The remote branch is adding imports for AbstractCloseable and Closeable, which could be needed for new functionality or proper resource management.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

package net.openhft.chronicle.map.impl.stage.query;

import net.openhft.chronicle.core.io.AbstractCloseable;
import net.openhft.chronicle.core.io.Closeable;
import net.openhft.chronicle.hash.impl.stage.hash.CheckOnEachPublicOperation;
import net.openhft.chronicle.map.MapClosable;
import net.openhft.chronicle.map.impl.stage.ret.UsingReturnValue;
import net.openhft.sg.StageRef;
import net.openhft.sg.Staged;
