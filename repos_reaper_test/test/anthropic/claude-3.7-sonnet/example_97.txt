Looking at this merge conflict, I see that both sides are constructing a `Game` object, but the right side (`ed08e371`) includes two additional parameters: `falseProvider` and `gameOptionsProvider`. This suggests the `Game` constructor was updated to accept more parameters.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
  public void setUp() {
    cuMock = createMock(ConnectedUsers.class);
    gmMock = createMock(GameManager.class);
    metricsMock = createMock(Metrics.class);
    game = new Game(0, cuMock, gmMock, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
        formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider);
  }

  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  @Test
  public void testRemovePlayer() throws IllegalStateException, TooManyPlayersException {

```

I've resolved in favor of the newer version from `ed08e371` since it appears to include an updated constructor signature with additional parameters that would be required for the class to compile correctly.
