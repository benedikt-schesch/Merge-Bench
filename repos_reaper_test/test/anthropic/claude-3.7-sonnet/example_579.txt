Based on the code snippet, I can see there's a merge conflict regarding the type of the `venue` field. One side has it as `Location` and the other as `Venue`. Without additional context about what these types represent in the codebase or which one is more appropriate, I'll preserve the conflict as it is:

```java
   * @return The location of this event, a structured address object.
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter
  @Facebook
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private Location venue;
=======
  private Venue venue;
>>>>>>> a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe

  /**
   * Number of people interested in the event.
   *
   * @since Graph API 2.1
```
