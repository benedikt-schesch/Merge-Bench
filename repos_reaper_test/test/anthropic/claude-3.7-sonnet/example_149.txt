Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side is creating a `GruntParser` with just a `StringReader` for the script, while the other side is also passing a `myPig` object. The newer commit (2125666) adds the additional `myPig` parameter, which is likely needed for proper context.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "describe b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
```

I chose the newer version because it's providing the `myPig` context to the parser, which is likely required for the parser to properly execute the pig script. The constructor with both parameters appears to be the correct implementation.
