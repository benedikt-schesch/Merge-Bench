Based on the provided code snippet, I can see a merge conflict where one side (HEAD) includes a serialVersionUID declaration, while the other side (a17acec0) has removed it or never had it. The serialVersionUID field is crucial for serialization in Java, ensuring version compatibility during deserialization.

Given that this is a subclass of NamedFacebookType, which likely implements Serializable, it makes sense to keep the serialVersionUID. Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java

  }

  public static class KeyedType extends NamedFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private String key;


```
