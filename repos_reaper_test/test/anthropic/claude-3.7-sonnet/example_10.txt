After analyzing the merge conflict, I can see both sides are trying to import different dependencies. The HEAD version is importing `org.spout.engine.entity.SpoutPlayer`, while the other branch is importing `org.spout.api.math.Vector3`. Since both imports seem to serve different purposes, I'll include both in the resolution.

```java
import org.spout.api.entity.Player;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Point;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Transform;
import org.spout.api.math.ReactConverter;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;

import org.spout.engine.entity.SpoutPlayer;
import org.spout.engine.world.SpoutRegion;
import org.spout.math.imaginary.Quaternion;
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.physics.body.MobileRigidBody;
import org.spout.physics.body.RigidBody;
```
