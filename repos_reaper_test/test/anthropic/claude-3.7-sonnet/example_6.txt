Looking at the merge conflict, I see there's a divergence in how certain team properties are written to the buffer depending on the protocol version. 

Let me carefully analyze what both sides are trying to do:

1. The HEAD version writes `nameTagVisibility` first, then conditionally writes `collisionRule` for 1.9+ protocols, and finally writes `color`.
2. The incoming version (80b3135a) only writes `collisionRule` with no conditional check for protocol version.

The correct resolution seems to be preserving the more detailed conditional logic from HEAD while ensuring `collisionRule` is written in the right place. Here's the resolved code:

```java
            writeString( prefix, buf );
            writeString( suffix, buf );
            buf.writeByte( friendlyFire );
            if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 )
            {
                writeString( nameTagVisibility, buf );
                if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_9 )
                {
                    writeString( collisionRule, buf);
                }
                buf.writeByte( color );
            }
        }
        if ( mode == 0 || mode == 3 || mode == 4 )
        {
            if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 )
```
