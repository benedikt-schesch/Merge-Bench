Looking at this merge conflict, I see the difference is in the type of texture being created. One side (HEAD) is using `BitmapTexture` while the other side (91801fd) is using `BitmapTextureAtlas`. This appears to be a class name change or update in the API.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

	@Override
	public void onLoadResources() {
		/* Load the font we are going to use. */
		FontFactory.setAssetBasePath("font/");
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(512, 512, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);
		this.mFont = FontFactory.createFromAsset(this.mFontTexture, this, "Plok.ttf", 32, true, Color.WHITE);

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mFontTexture);
		this.mEngine.getFontManager().loadFont(this.mFont);

```

I've chosen the `BitmapTextureAtlas` version because:
1. It appears to be from a newer commit (91801fd)
2. The rest of the code doesn't show any compatibility issues with this class
3. It's likely that the class was renamed from `BitmapTexture` to `BitmapTextureAtlas` in an API update
