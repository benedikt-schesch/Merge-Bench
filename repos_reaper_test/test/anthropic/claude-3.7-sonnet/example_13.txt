Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to set `this.plugin` to the meta plugin obtained from Spout's plugin manager, but they're doing it in slightly different ways:

1. The HEAD version directly calls `Spout.getPluginManager().getMetaPlugin()`
2. The incoming change first casts the plugin manager to `PluginManager` before calling `getMetaPlugin()`

The casting in the incoming change suggests that there might have been an API change where the `getPluginManager()` method now returns a more general interface that doesn't include the `getMetaPlugin()` method, requiring an explicit cast to access that functionality.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
	private DateFormat dateFormat;
	private List<Widget> lines = new ArrayList<Widget>();
	private float scroll = 0;

	public DevConsole(Font font) {
		this.plugin = ((PluginManager) Spout.getPluginManager()).getMetaPlugin();
		this.font = font;
		init();
	}
	
	public void clearConsole() {
```

I've chosen the incoming change as it's likely accounting for a more recent API change that requires the explicit cast to `PluginManager`.
