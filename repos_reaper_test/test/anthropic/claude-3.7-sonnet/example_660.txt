Looking at this merge conflict, I see that one side didn't add anything, while the other side added a line to initialize a `projectConfigurationManager` by getting it from `MavenPlugin`. This addition doesn't conflict with any other changes, so I'll resolve by keeping the added initialization.

```java
		buildService.setJdk(jdk);
		
		listener = new DummyAndroidBuildListener();

		registry.registerBuildListener(listener);
		projectConfigurationManager = MavenPlugin.getProjectConfigurationManager();
    }

	@Override
	protected void tearDown() throws Exception {
		listener.clear();
```
