Looking at the conflict, both sides are attempting to check if the application is running as a native image by checking a system property. The difference is in how they reference the property key and value:

- HEAD uses constants `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY` and `PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME` 
- The other branch uses the string literals directly: `"org.graalvm.nativeimage.imagecode"` and `"runtime"`

Since the constants are likely defined elsewhere in the code and would make the code more maintainable, I'll prefer the HEAD version that uses constants.

```java
    }

    public String toString() {
      // When running the application as a native image, append `-graalvm` to the
      // version.
      String imageCode = System.getProperty(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_KEY);
      if (imageCode != null && imageCode.equals(PROPERTY_IMAGE_CODE_VALUE_RUNTIME)){
        String[] tokens = versionString.split(" ");
        if (tokens.length > 0 && tokens[0].startsWith("gl-java")) {
          tokens[0] += "-graalvm";
          return Joiner.on(" ").join(tokens);
        }

```
