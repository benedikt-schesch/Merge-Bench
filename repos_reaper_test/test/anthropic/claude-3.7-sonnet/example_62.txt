The merge conflict appears to be about the formatting of the logger statement. One version spans multiple lines, while the other has the same content on a single line. Since the content is identical, and it's just a formatting difference, I'll choose the multi-line version for better readability.

```java

    synchronized (playedCards) {
      if (state == GameState.PLAYING || playersToRemove.size() == 0) {
        // not sure how much of this check is actually required
        if (players.size() < 3 || playedCards.size() < 2) {
          logger.info(String.format(
              "Resetting game %d due to insufficient players after removing %d idle players.",
              id, playersToRemove.size()));
          resetState(true);
        } else {
          judgingState();
        }
      }

```
