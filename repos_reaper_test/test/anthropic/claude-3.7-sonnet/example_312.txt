Looking at this merge conflict, it appears both sides are trying to set up API references but with different implementations. One side has `mApi` as a `Weibo` instance (labeled "new API"), while the other has both `mApi` as a `TwitterApi` and `nApi` as a `Weibo` (labeled "new API"). The second side also introduces a `mDb2` field.

Here's the resolved code, combining the intent of both sides:

```java
  
  public static final String TAG = "TwitterApplication";
  
  public static ImageManager mImageManager;
  public static TwitterDbAdapter mDb; 
  public static TwitterApi mApi;
  public static Weibo nApi; // new API
  public static Context mContext;
  public static DatabaseHelper mDb2; 

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();

```

I've preserved both API references from the second branch while keeping the `mContext` from the first branch, as they appear to serve different purposes. This approach maintains the functionality intended by both changes.
