Looking at this merge conflict, it appears one branch is using `mBitmapTexture` and the other is using `mBitmapTextureAtlas` for the SpriteBatch construction. This seems to be a change in the texture object being used. Let me resolve this based on the most likely intended change:

```java
				this.draw(faceSprite1);
				this.draw(faceSprite2);
			}
		};
		
		final SpriteBatch staticSpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, 2);
		staticSpriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, -50, 0, this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth(), this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight(), 2, 2);
		staticSpriteBatch.draw(this.mFaceTextureRegion, 50, 0, this.mFaceTextureRegion.getWidth(), this.mFaceTextureRegion.getHeight(), 45);
		staticSpriteBatch.submit();

		dynamicSpriteBatch.setPosition(centerX, centerY - 50);
```

I've chosen the newer version with `mBitmapTextureAtlas` as it likely represents a refactoring from a simple texture to a texture atlas, which is a common improvement in graphics programming to better organize multiple textures.
