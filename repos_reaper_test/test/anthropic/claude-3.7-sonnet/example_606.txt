Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

  }

  public static class MailingAddress extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * The mailing address ID.
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter

```

I've resolved the conflict by keeping the `private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;` line. This is a standard serialization ID that should be included in classes that implement Serializable (which is likely the case for a class extending AbstractFacebookType). Removing this could cause serialization compatibility issues, so it's safer to keep it.
