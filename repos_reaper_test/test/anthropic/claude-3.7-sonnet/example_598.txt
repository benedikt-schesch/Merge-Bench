Based on the merge conflict, one side (HEAD) has a `serialVersionUID` declaration, and the other side (a17acec0655b8058aaf4d336ba2a1352aa49e2fe) does not include this field.

Since `serialVersionUID` is important for Java serialization to maintain compatibility across versions, and removing it could potentially cause issues with deserialization, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the serialVersionUID declaration:

```java
   * 
   * @since 1.10.0
   */
  public static class PageRestaurantServices extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    @Facebook
    private Boolean catering;

```
