Looking at the merge conflict, both sides are trying to notify the `mShowcaseView` of an orientation change when it's not null. The only difference is that one side uses a single line (HEAD) and the other uses a block statement with braces (c923751...). Since both accomplish the same thing and the block style with braces is generally considered better practice for clarity, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the version with braces.

```java
        mWidgetRenderer.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);
        mSwitchRingPad.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);
        mSavePinger.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);
        mReviewDrawer.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);

        if (mShowcaseView != null) {
            mShowcaseView.notifyOrientationChanged(mOrientationCompensation);
        }
    }

    public void updateCapabilities() {
        // Populate the sidebar buttons a little later (so we have camera parameters)
        mHandler.post(new Runnable() {

```
