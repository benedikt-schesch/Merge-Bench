Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that both sides are asserting things about what appears to be a `GoogleJsonResponseException` object, but they're using different variable names and making slightly different assertions about the message field.

Here's my resolution:

```java
        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "403\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
  }

  public void testFrom_errorEmptyContentButWithJsonContentType() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport(null, Json.MEDIA_TYPE);
      HttpRequest request =
```

I resolved the conflict by keeping the HEAD version because:
1. It uses the correct variable name `responseException` that was declared earlier, not `ge`
2. It appears to be a more precise test with an exact expected message, rather than just checking if it starts with "403"
3. The code flow is more consistent with the variable naming in the surrounding context
