Based on the provided snippet, I can see that there's a merge conflict regarding the inclusion of a `serialVersionUID` field in the `DebugTokenError` class.

The HEAD branch includes the serialVersionUID declaration, which is good practice for serializable classes in Java to ensure version compatibility. The other commit (a17acec) removes this field.

Since the class extends `AbstractFacebookType`, which likely implements `Serializable`, maintaining the serialVersionUID is generally a good practice for proper serialization behavior. Therefore, I'll resolve by keeping the serialVersionUID declaration.

```java

  }

  class DebugTokenError extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Facebook
    private Integer code;

    @Facebook
    private String message;

```
