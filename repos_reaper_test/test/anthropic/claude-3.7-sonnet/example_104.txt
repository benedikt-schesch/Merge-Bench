I'll resolve this merge conflict focusing on the intent and semantics of both sides. Let me analyze:

This appears to be a Java class with assertion methods for shorts. The conflict is about formatting style in the `isNotEqualTo` method declaration:
- The HEAD version has no space between the parameter parenthesis and the opening brace
- The other version (61056d6) includes a space before the opening brace

Based on the context (the first method seems to follow the same style pattern as the second version with spaces), I'll resolve this:

```java
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

  public ShortAssert isNotEqualTo(short expected) {
    shorts.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

```
