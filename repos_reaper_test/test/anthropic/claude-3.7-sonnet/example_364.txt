Looking at the code snippet, I see two merge conflicts. 

The first conflict is in the `buildDeleteRequest` method. One side returns a `MockLowLevelHttpRequest()` with no arguments, while the other returns a `MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url)` which passes the URL parameter to the constructor.

The second conflict appears to be incomplete but is in the `buildGetRequest` method.

Since passing the URL parameter to the `MockLowLevelHttpRequest` constructor is more informative and likely intended to correctly set up the request object with its target URL, I'll resolve the first conflict by keeping the version that includes the URL parameter.

For the second conflict, since it's incomplete and I can't see both sides, I'll leave it as is.

```java
  public EnumSet<HttpMethod> supportedOptionalMethods =
      EnumSet.of(HttpMethod.HEAD, HttpMethod.PATCH);

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildDeleteRequest(String url) throws IOException {
    return new MockLowLevelHttpRequest(url);
  }

  @Override
  public LowLevelHttpRequest buildGetRequest(String url) throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
