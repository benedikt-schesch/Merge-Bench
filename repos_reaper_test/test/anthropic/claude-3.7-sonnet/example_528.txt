Looking at the merge conflict, I need to resolve the differences between the constant values for alarm-related commands. Both sides are defining constants for getting supported alarms and their reports, but with different names and values.

```java

    private static final int MAX_SUPPORTED_VERSION = 3;

    private static final int ALARM_GET = 0x04;
    private static final int ALARM_REPORT = 0x05;
    private static final int ALARM_SUPPORTED_GET = 0x06;
    private static final int ALARM_SUPPORTED_REPORT = 0x07;

    private final Map<AlarmType, Alarm> alarms = new HashMap<AlarmType, Alarm>();

    @XStreamOmitField
    private boolean initialiseDone = false;

```

I resolved the conflict by choosing the HEAD version because:
1. It uses a more consistent naming pattern (ALARM_SUPPORTED_GET) that matches other constants in the codebase
2. The values (0x06, 0x07) appear to follow a sequential pattern with the preceding constants (0x04, 0x05)
3. The alternate version appears to have shifted the values and renamed one constant, which could introduce compatibility issues
