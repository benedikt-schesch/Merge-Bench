Looking at the merge conflict, it appears that there's a change in the type of texture being used. One side is using `BitmapTexture` while the other is using `BitmapTextureAtlas`. This likely represents an API change or update in the engine being used.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
		return new Engine(new EngineOptions(true, ScreenOrientation.LANDSCAPE, new RatioResolutionPolicy(CAMERA_WIDTH, CAMERA_HEIGHT), this.mCamera));
	}

	@Override
	public void onLoadResources() {
		this.mFontTexture = new BitmapTextureAtlas(256, 256, TextureOptions.BILINEAR_PREMULTIPLYALPHA);

		this.mFont = new Font(this.mFontTexture, Typeface.create(Typeface.DEFAULT, Typeface.BOLD), 32, true, Color.BLACK);

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mFontTexture);
		this.mEngine.getFontManager().loadFont(this.mFont);
```

I've chosen the `BitmapTextureAtlas` implementation because it appears to be from a newer commit (as indicated by the commit hash), suggesting it's likely an updated class name or API change that replaced `BitmapTexture`.
