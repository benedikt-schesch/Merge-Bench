I'll analyze this merge conflict carefully.

Both sides of the merge are trying to set the text of `commitMessageTextView` using the commit message, but they're accessing the message through different paths:
- One side is using `commit.commit.message`
- The other side is using `commit.message` 

Looking at the context, we can see that the parameter is a `Commit` object that has a nested `commit` field. In the surrounding code, `commit.commit.message` is checked in the if condition, suggesting that this is the correct path to access the message.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

  @Override
  public void onResponse(Commit commit, boolean firstTime) {

    if (commit.commit != null && commit.commit.message != null) {
      commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.commit.message));
    }

    User author = commit.author;

    if (author != null) {

```
