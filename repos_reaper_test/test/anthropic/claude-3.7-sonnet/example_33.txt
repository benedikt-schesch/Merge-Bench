Looking at this merge conflict, I see that one side (HEAD) is importing `org.spout.math.imaginary.Quaternion`, while the other side (cc0703...) appears to have removed this import or never added it.

Since the context doesn't show any usage of the `Quaternion` class in the visible code, I'll resolve by keeping the import since it's safer to have an unused import than to remove one that might be needed.

```java
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Point;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Transform;
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.util.thread.annotation.SnapshotRead;
import org.spout.api.util.thread.annotation.Threadsafe;
import org.spout.math.imaginary.Quaternion;

import org.spout.physics.collision.shape.CollisionShape;

/**
 * Component that gives the owner the characteristics to be a part of a Scene. <p> A Scene consists of {@link Transform}s which represent the snapshot state, the live state, and the rendering state.
 * This component can be used to manipulate the object within the scene.
