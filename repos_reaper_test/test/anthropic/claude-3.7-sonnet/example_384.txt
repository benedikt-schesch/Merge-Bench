Looking at the merge conflict, I see a simple difference between HEAD and the incoming change from 0b628c40c6a74e31e3c63b0b545670b5fc2b68c0 - the only difference is an additional newline after the `mTextView.append(spannable);` statement.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
            mTextView.setText(mTextView.getEditableText().delete(0, mTextView.getText().toString().split("\n", 2)[0].length()+1));
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        } else {
            mTextView.append(spannable);
        }

        mTextView.setTextSize(mOptions.textSize);
        mTextView.append("\n");
    }

    @Override
```

I chose to keep the newline from the incoming change because it improves code readability by separating the logical sections (the if/else block from the subsequent operations).
