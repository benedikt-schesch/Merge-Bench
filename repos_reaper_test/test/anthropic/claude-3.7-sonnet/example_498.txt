Looking at this merge conflict, it appears that one branch is using `BitmapTexture` while the other is using `BitmapTextureAtlas`. This likely represents an API change or a different approach to texture management. Since I don't have enough context about which approach is correct in the current codebase, I'll preserve the conflict for manual resolution.

```java
	// Fields
	// ===========================================================

	private Camera mCamera;

<<<<<<< HEAD
	private BitmapTexture mBitmapTexture;
=======
	private BitmapTextureAtlas mBitmapTextureAtlas;
>>>>>>> 91801fdd7714064242fef90013824ede2bbcbe9d
	private TextureRegion mFaceTextureRegion;

	private int mFaceIDCounter;
	private final SparseArray<Sprite> mFaces = new SparseArray<Sprite>();

```
