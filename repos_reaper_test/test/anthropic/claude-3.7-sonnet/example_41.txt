Looking at this merge conflict, it appears to be a simple difference in formatting. Both sides of the merge have the same log message, but the HEAD version splits it across two lines while the 5adedd2 commit keeps it on a single line.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
      // this seems terrible
      if (players.size() == 0) {
        gameManager.destroyGame(id);
      }
      if (players.size() < 3 && state != GameState.LOBBY) {
        logger.info(String.format("Resetting game %d due to too few players after someone left.", id));
        resetState(true);
      } else if (wasJudge) {
        synchronized (roundTimerLock) {
          final SafeTimerTask task = new SafeTimerTask() {
            @Override
```

I've chosen the single-line version from the 5adedd2 commit since it's more compact and consistent with common Java formatting practices. The functional content is identical in both versions.
