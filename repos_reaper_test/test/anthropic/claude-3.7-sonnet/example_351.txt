Looking at the merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides. The conflict appears to be about how to assert expectations on a `GoogleJsonResponseException` object. However, I notice one side refers to the variable as `responseException` while the other uses `ge` which isn't declared in the visible context.

Since the variable is defined as `responseException` in the code before the conflict, the usage of `ge` in the second part seems to be a mistake or a variable name that was changed. I'll resolve in favor of the HEAD version, which maintains consistency with the variable name.

```java
        transport.createRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL);
    request.setThrowExceptionOnExecuteError(false);
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    GoogleJsonResponseException responseException =
        GoogleJsonResponseException.from(GoogleJsonErrorTest.FACTORY, response);
    assertNull(responseException.getDetails());
    String expectedMessage = "403\nGET " + HttpTesting.SIMPLE_GENERIC_URL;
    assertEquals(expectedMessage, responseException.getMessage());
  }

  public void testFrom_detailsArbitraryJsonContent() throws Exception {
    HttpTransport transport = new ErrorTransport("{\"foo\":\"bar\"}", Json.MEDIA_TYPE);
    HttpRequest request =
