Here's the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict fixed:

```java
   * The user's picture, if provided.
   * 
   * To force Facebook to fill the <code>picture</code> field you have to fetch the user with the
   * <code>fields=picture</code> parameter, otherwise the picture is <code>null</code>.
   * 
   * @return the user's picture as ProfilePictureSource object
   * @since 1.6.16
   */
  @Getter
  @Setter

```

I resolved the merge conflict by keeping the HEAD version which specifies the return type as "ProfilePictureSource object" rather than just "picture object". The HEAD version provides more specific type information, which is generally more helpful for documentation.
