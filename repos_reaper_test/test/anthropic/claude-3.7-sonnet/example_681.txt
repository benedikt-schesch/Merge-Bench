Looking at the merge conflict, both sides are attempting to display a warning message about missing principals during deployment, but they differ in terminology and how they join the list of missing principals.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
>>>>>>> 83418dbbb7fe923f2aef29aa4f23d01886e1b965
						+ "Consider adding these principals to your <a href=\"https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf\">pre-deploy.conf</a> and re-importing.";

				logger.info("\n###############################################################################\n"
						+ "\tWarning: " + title + "!\n"
						+ "\tThe following user(s) and/or group(s) are missing for resource access permissions or node ownership during deployment.\n"
						+ "\tBecause of these missing permissions/ownerships, the functionality is not identical to the export you just imported.\n\n"
						+ "\t" + missingPrincipals.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.joining("\n\t"))
						+ "\n\n\tConsider adding these principals to your 'pre-deploy.conf' (see https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts#pre-deployconf) and re-importing.\n"
						+ "###############################################################################"
				);
				publishWarningMessage(title, text);
			}
```
