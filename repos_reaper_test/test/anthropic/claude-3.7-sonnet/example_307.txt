I'll resolve the merge conflict. This conflict is about code formatting - specifically about spacing around the `catch` parentheses.

```java
	 */
	public static void createAndShowGUI() {
		Log.d(LOG_TAG, "set to system default LaF");
		try {
			UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
		} catch (Exception ex) {
			System.out.println("Cannot find system look and feel, setting to metal.");
		}
		Log.d(LOG_TAG, "createAndShowGUI");
		flingFrame = new FlingFrame();
		// change the default app icon; might not work for all platforms
```

The conflict was just about a space between `catch` and the opening parenthesis. I chose the version with the space as it's more common in Java style guides to have a space after keywords like `catch`.
