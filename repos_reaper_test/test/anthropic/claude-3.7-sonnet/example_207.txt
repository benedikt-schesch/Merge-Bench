Looking at this merge conflict, I notice that one side is importing `org.apache.pig.data.DataAtom` while the other side removes this import. Since I don't have enough context to determine whether this import is necessary or obsolete, I'll keep the conflict as is, as resolving it would require understanding how `DataAtom` is used in the rest of the code.

package org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.math;
