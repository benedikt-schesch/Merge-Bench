Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to load a texture using the `loadTexture` method, but they're passing different parameters. One side uses `this.mBitmapTexture` while the other uses `this.mBitmapTextureAtlas`. This suggests a potential renaming of the texture variable in the codebase.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
			this.mMusic.setLooping(true);
		} catch (final IOException e) {
			Debug.e(e);
		}

		this.mEngine.getTextureManager().loadTexture(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas);
	}

	@Override
	public Scene onLoadScene() {
		this.mEngine.registerUpdateHandler(new FPSLogger());
```

I've chosen `this.mBitmapTextureAtlas` because the change from the newer commit (91801fdd) likely represents an updated naming convention or refactoring to use a texture atlas instead of a simple texture.
