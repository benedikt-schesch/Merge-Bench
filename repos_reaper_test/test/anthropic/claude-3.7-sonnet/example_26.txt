Looking at this merge conflict, I notice that one side (HEAD) is importing additional utility classes and a config exception, while the other side (5463b8f) has removed these imports. To properly resolve this, I need to determine if these imports are needed. Since the imports appear to be utility classes that might be used elsewhere in the code, and I don't have the full context to determine if they're unused, I'll preserve them.

```java
import org.spout.api.plugin.security.PluginSecurityManager;
import org.spout.api.plugin.services.ServiceManager;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Protocol;
import org.spout.api.scheduler.TaskManager;
import org.spout.api.scheduler.TaskPriority;
import org.spout.api.util.StringMap;
import org.spout.api.util.StringUtil;
import org.spout.cereal.config.ConfigurationException;

import org.spout.engine.command.AnnotatedCommandExecutorTest;
import org.spout.engine.command.ClientCommands;
import org.spout.engine.command.CommonCommands;
import org.spout.engine.command.InputCommands;
import org.spout.engine.command.MessagingCommands;
```
