Looking at the merge conflict, it appears that one branch is trying to unregister a `libraryUpdateReceiver` in addition to the `videoUpdateReceiver` that's already in the code. Since both receivers should be unregistered when the component stops, I'll resolve by keeping both unregister blocks.

```java
        try {
            getActivity().unregisterReceiver(videoUpdateReceiver);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            // do nothing
        }
        try {
            getActivity().unregisterReceiver(libraryUpdateReceiver);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            // do nothing
        }
        super.onStop();
    }

    @Override
    public void onAddClicked(CharSequence user, CharSequence password,
