Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that one side added an additional conditional block checking if the `uriString.length()` is greater than `maxUriLength` with a slightly different warning message ("characters" instead of "bytes"), while the other side removed this code.

However, this is redundant with the identical condition that's already present in the code directly above the conflict. The conflict is actually a duplicate check with a slightly different error message.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                        if (maxUriLength > 0 && uriString.length() > maxUriLength){
                            if (verbose){
                                System.err.println("[WARNING] File " + newUrl + " creates a data URI larger than " + maxUriLength + " bytes. Skipping.");
                            }      
                            builder.append(url);
                        } else {

                            /*
                             * Determine what to do. Eventually, you should be able to
                             * have both a data URI and MHTML in the same file.
