Let me resolve these merge conflicts:

```java

  protected ShortAssert(Short actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ShortAssert.class, description);
  }

  public ShortAssert isEqualTo(short expected) {
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }


```

In this case, the only difference was a spacing issue - the incoming change (from commit 61056d6) adds a space between the closing parenthesis and the opening brace in the method declaration. I've adopted that style since it appears to be a formatting improvement.
