Looking at this merge conflict, it appears that the `790b69a0bd40e3ab536f9c6568748f981b3d525e` commit adds a new constructor for `CSSURLEmbedder` with four parameters, while the HEAD doesn't have this constructor.

Since this is adding a completely new constructor (not modifying an existing one), and there's no overlapping change or conflict in the actual implementation, I'll resolve it by keeping the new constructor.

```java
        this.options = options;
        this.maxUriLength = maxUriLength;
        this.maxImageSize = maxImageSize;
    }

    public CSSURLEmbedder(Reader in, int options, boolean verbose, int maxUriLength) throws IOException {
        this.code = readCode(in);
        this.verbose = verbose;
        this.options = options;
        this.maxUriLength = maxUriLength;
    }

    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Get/Set verbose flag
    //--------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    
    public boolean getVerbose(){
```
