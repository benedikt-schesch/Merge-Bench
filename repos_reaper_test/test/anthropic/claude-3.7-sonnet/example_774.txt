Based on the merge conflict, I need to determine which change to adopt for the `qualifiers` field. Looking at the surrounding context, this is part of a method that sets a qualifier in what appears to be a scanning operation.

The conflict shows:
- HEAD version: `this.qualifiers = new byte[][] { qualifier };` (2D array)
- Remote version: `this.qualifiers = new byte[][][] { { qualifier } };` (3D array)

Without more context about how `qualifiers` is used elsewhere in the codebase, this is difficult to confidently resolve. The difference in dimensionality of the arrays suggests a significant change in the underlying data structure. Since the intent is ambiguous without more information, I'll return the snippet with the conflict intact:

```java
   * @throws IllegalStateException if scanning already started.
   */
  public void setQualifier(final byte[] qualifier) {
    KeyValue.checkQualifier(qualifier);
    checkScanningNotStarted();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    this.qualifiers = new byte[][] { qualifier };
=======
    this.qualifiers = new byte[][][] { { qualifier } };
>>>>>>> d543609051366758e579ad168361daadd74cdf7f
  }

  /** Specifies a particular column qualifier to scan.  */
  public void setQualifier(final String qualifier) {
    setQualifier(qualifier.getBytes());
```
