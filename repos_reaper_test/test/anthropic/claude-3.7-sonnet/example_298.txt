Looking at the merge conflict, I need to understand the intent on both sides. This is for an unmarshalling method that converts a database object to a specific class.

The original code uses a DocumentStream approach with a mapper, while the incoming change uses a reader with a JSON variable that isn't defined in the visible code. Since the reader and json variables aren't defined in the visible context, and the method signature uses DBObject document, the HEAD version appears to better match the method's parameters.

Here's the resolved code:

```java

    public <T> T unmarshall(DBObject document, Class<T> clazz) throws MarshallingException {

        DocumentStream stream = DocumentStreamFactory.fromDBObject(document);
        try {
            return mapper.readValue(stream.getData(), stream.getOffset(), stream.getSize(), clazz);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            String message = String.format("Unable to unmarshall result to %s from content %s", clazz, document.toString());
            throw new MarshallingException(message, e);
        }
    }

    public DBObject marshall(Object obj) throws MarshallingException {

```
