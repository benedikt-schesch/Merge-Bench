Looking at the merge conflict, both sides are defining a test for the same functionality: checking that nothing is updated if classes aren't changed. The conflict involves differences in:

1. Method modifier: `void` vs `public void`
2. How the test verifies no exceptions: one uses `assertDoesNotThrow`, the other verifies no interactions with the `workspace` mock

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java

		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);		
	}

	@Test
	void shouldNotUpdateIfClassesAreNotChanged() throws CoreException {
		assertDoesNotThrow(() -> processor.processEvent(emptyEvent()));
		
		verifyNoInteractions(workspace);
	}

	@Test
	void shouldRespondToPostBuildEvents() {
		IResourceChangeEvent event = new ResourceChangeEvent(this, POST_BUILD, AUTO_BUILD, null);

```

I've chosen to:
1. Keep `void` over `public void` (aligns with other test methods)
2. Combine both assertions to verify both no exceptions and no interactions with workspace
3. Maintain the code style of the project
