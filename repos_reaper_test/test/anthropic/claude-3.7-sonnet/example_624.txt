Looking at the merge conflict, I can see that one branch wants to add a `serialVersionUID` field while the other branch removes it. Since this class is extending `AbstractFacebookType` which likely implements `Serializable`, it's generally good practice to include an explicit `serialVersionUID` for serializable classes. I'll resolve by keeping the serialVersionUID definition.

```java
    }
  }

  public static class Targeting extends AbstractFacebookType {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * @RestFB.GraphApi.Since 2.8
     */
    @Getter
    @Setter

```
