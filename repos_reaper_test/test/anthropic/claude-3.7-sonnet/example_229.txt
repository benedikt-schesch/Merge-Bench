Looking at this merge conflict, I see that both sides have added similar code, but there's a difference in how the temporary file is created. 

The HEAD version uses generic naming (`"test", "txt"`) while the other commit uses a more specific naming convention that includes the test name (`this.getName(), ".txt"`). The second approach is generally better for debugging since it makes it clear which test created the file.

Here's the resolution:

```java
    }

    @Test
    public void testBigGroupAll() throws Throwable {
        int LOOP_COUNT = 4*1024;
        File tmpFile = File.createTempFile(this.getName(), ".txt");
        PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(tmpFile));
        for(int i = 0; i < LOOP_COUNT; i++) {
            ps.println(i);
        }
        ps.close();
```
