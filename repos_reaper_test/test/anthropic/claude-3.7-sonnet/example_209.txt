Based on the merge conflict, it appears that one branch (HEAD) added a `log` method, while the other branch (from commit 1488b22) added an `isEnabled` method and also included the same `log` method.

Here's my resolution which preserves both methods since they serve different purposes:

```java
    public SocketImpl createSocketImpl() {
        return new SSHSocketImpl(session);

    }

    public boolean isEnabled(int arg0) {
        // Default to not logging anything
        return false;
    }

    public void log(int arg0, String arg1) {
        log.error(arg0 + ": " + arg1);
    }


```
