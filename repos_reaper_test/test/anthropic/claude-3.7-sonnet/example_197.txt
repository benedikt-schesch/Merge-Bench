I see a merge conflict in the code snippet around the `funcSpec` variable declaration. Let me analyze the conflict:

1. HEAD version: `String funcSpec;`
2. Incoming version (1488b22): `FuncSpec funcSpec;`

Looking at the surrounding code, it seems that `funcSpec` is used in `definedFunctions.get(alias)` and then passed to `instantiateFuncFromSpec()`. The conflict is about the type of `funcSpec` - whether it should be a `String` or a `FuncSpec` object.

Given that the subsequent code uses `funcSpec` in `instantiateFuncFromSpec()`, and the same method is also called with `alias` (which appears to be a String), it seems likely that the `FuncSpec` type is the correct one as part of a refactoring to make the type more specific.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
        }
        return resolveClassName(className);
    }
  
    public Object instantiateFuncFromAlias(String alias) throws IOException {
        FuncSpec funcSpec;
        if (definedFunctions != null && (funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias))!=null)
            return instantiateFuncFromSpec(funcSpec);
        else
            return instantiateFuncFromSpec(alias);
    }

```
