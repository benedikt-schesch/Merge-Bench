Looking at this merge conflict, the difference is minimal:

- The left side (`HEAD`) uses `new HashMap<GamePlayerInfo, Object>()` with explicit type parameters.
- The right side (from commit 5adedd24) uses `new HashMap<>()` with the diamond operator syntax, which was introduced in Java 7 and allows type inference.

Since the diamond operator `<>` is the more modern and preferred Java syntax (reducing verbosity while maintaining type safety), I'll resolve this by choosing the right side's version.

```java
   *
   * @param player The player for whom to get status.
   * @return Information for {@code player}: Name, score, status.
   */
  public Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object> getPlayerInfo(final Player player) {
    final Map<GamePlayerInfo, Object> playerInfo = new HashMap<>();
    // TODO make sure this can't happen in the first place
    if (player == null) {
      return playerInfo;
    }
    playerInfo.put(GamePlayerInfo.NAME, player.getUser().getNickname());
```
