Looking at the merge conflict, it appears the difference is which texture object is being used to initialize a `SpriteGroup`. One side is using `this.mBitmapTexture` while the other is using `this.mBitmapTextureAtlas`. Based on the naming convention, it seems like there might have been a change in how textures are managed, with a transition from a simple texture to a texture atlas.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
				new DelayModifier(2),
				new AlphaModifier(1.5f, 1, 0),
				new AlphaModifier(1.5f, 0, 1)
		);

		final SpriteGroup spriteGroup = new SpriteGroup(this.mBitmapTextureAtlas, SPRITE_COUNT);
		for(int i = 0; i < SPRITE_COUNT; i++) {
			final Sprite face = new Sprite((CAMERA_WIDTH - 32) * this.mRandom.nextFloat(), (CAMERA_HEIGHT - 32) * this.mRandom.nextFloat(), this.mFaceTextureRegion);
			face.registerEntityModifier(faceEntityModifier.clone());

			spriteGroup.attachChild(face);
```

I chose `this.mBitmapTextureAtlas` as it seems to be part of a newer update (from the branch being merged in), and texture atlases are generally preferable for sprite management in game engines as they offer performance benefits over individual textures.
