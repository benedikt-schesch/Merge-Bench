Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that it's a disagreement about which logging library to use: `log4j.Logger` (in the incoming changes) versus `logging.log4j.Logger` (in the current HEAD).

The HEAD version is using the newer Log4j 2.x API with the `org.apache.logging.log4j` package, while the incoming change is using the older Log4j 1.x API with `org.apache.log4j`.

Since Log4j 2.x is the more current version with security improvements, I'll resolve in favor of the HEAD version:

```java
import net.socialgamer.cah.RequestWrapper;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.ConnectedUsers;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.QueuedMessage;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.QueuedMessage.MessageType;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.User;

import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpSession;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
