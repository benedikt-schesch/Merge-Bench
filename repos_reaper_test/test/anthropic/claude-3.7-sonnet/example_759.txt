I'll resolve this merge conflict by considering the intent of both sides. It appears to be a simple difference in a sleep duration within a test or example.

```java
            });
        }
        mapReference.set(mapBuilder.createPersistedTo(mapFile));
        try (ExternalMapQueryContext<Integer, Integer, ?> c = mapReference.get().queryContext(KEY)) {
            c.writeLock().lock();
            Thread.sleep(8_000);
        }
    }

    private static ChronicleMapBuilder<Integer, Integer> createMapBuilder() {
        return ChronicleMapBuilder

```

I chose the newer change (8,000 milliseconds) as it appears to be an intentional reduction in the sleep duration from 30 seconds to 8 seconds, which likely improves test execution time while still serving the same testing purpose.
