Looking at the merge conflict, I need to decide whether to keep the `randomizeFileLocalizer()` method or remove it.

The method seems to be setting a random seed in the `FileLocalizer` class, which is likely used for testing or ensuring deterministic behavior when localizing files. Since the "HEAD" version explicitly adds this functionality and the other version removes it, I'll preserve the method as this appears to be an intentional addition rather than something that should be removed.

```java
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public void randomizeFileLocalizer(){
        FileLocalizer.setR(new Random());
    }

    /**
     * Used to get the compiled plan
     * @return map reduce plan built by the compiler
     */
    public MROperPlan getMRPlan() {

```
