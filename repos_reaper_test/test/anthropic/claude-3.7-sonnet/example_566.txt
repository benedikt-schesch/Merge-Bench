After analyzing the merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent: asserting that the variable `counter` equals the value `18`. The difference is only in the assertion style being used:

- One side uses `assertThat(counter).isEqualTo(18)`, which appears to be using a fluent assertion library (likely AssertJ).
- The other side uses `assertEquals(18, counter)`, which uses a more traditional assertion style (likely JUnit).

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```java
      for (FacebookType type : page) {
        counter++;
      }
    }

    assertEquals(18, counter);
  }

  @Test
  public void checkIterator_snapshot() {
    Connection<FacebookType> connection = create3PageConnection();

```

I've chosen to use the `assertEquals(18, counter)` approach as it appears to be from the newer commit and is a more common JUnit style assertion pattern.
