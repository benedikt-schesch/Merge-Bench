Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) is defining a variable to get an RPC from `rpcs_inflight` using the `rpcid`, while the other side (d5436...) has removed this line completely. 

Given the surrounding context, the `rpc` variable appears to be used in the `deserializeException` method call immediately following this conflict. Since removing this line would likely cause a compilation error (as `rpc` is used later), and there doesn't seem to be an alternative way to obtain the `rpc` object in the nearby code, I'll resolve this by keeping the line that defines the `rpc` variable.

```java
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        LOG.error("WTF?  RPC #" + rpcid + ": ", e);
      }
    }

    final HBaseRpc rpc = rpcs_inflight.get(rpcid);
    if ((flags & HBaseRpc.RPC_ERROR) != 0) {
      return deserializeException(buf, rpc);
    }
    try {

```
