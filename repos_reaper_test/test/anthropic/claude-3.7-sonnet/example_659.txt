Looking at this merge conflict, it appears that the base version doesn't have a declaration for `projectConfigurationManager`, while the incoming change (from commit b782a4b) is adding this field declaration. Since this is a simple addition with no conflicting changes to the same line, I'll resolve it by including the new field declaration.

```java
	@Inject
	private BuildListenerRegistry registry;

	protected AndroidBuildService buildService;

	private IProjectConfigurationManager projectConfigurationManager;

	@Override
	@SuppressWarnings("restriction")
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
	    super.setUp();

```
