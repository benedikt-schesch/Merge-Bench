Looking at this merge conflict, it seems that the version from HEAD includes code to handle a case where the json generator doesn't support certain operations, while the incoming change from commit bdcc9aaa22f9470ce4d424736aabbc49c4857931 doesn't have this condition.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```java
                jsonGenerator.writeStartObject();
                jsonGenerator.writeFieldName("$numberDecimal");
                jsonGenerator.writeString(decimal.bigDecimalValue().toString());
                jsonGenerator.writeEndObject();
            } else {
                handleUnsupportedGenerator(jsonGenerator);
            }
        }
    }

```
