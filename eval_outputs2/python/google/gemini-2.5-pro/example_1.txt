The intent of both sides of this merge conflict appears to be the addition of a module to a list. `HEAD` is adding a `Mapper` module, while the incoming change is adding a `Matcher` module. Without further context, it is impossible to know if one was a rename of the other, or if they are two distinct modules that should both be included. Therefore, the conflict is ambiguous and cannot be resolved automatically.

```python
        from plugin.modules.scheduler.main import Scheduler
        from plugin.modules.sessions.main import Sessions
        from plugin.modules.upgrade.main import Upgrade

        return [
<<<<<<< HEAD
            Mapper,
=======
            Matcher,

            Scheduler,
            Sessions,
            Upgrade
        ]
