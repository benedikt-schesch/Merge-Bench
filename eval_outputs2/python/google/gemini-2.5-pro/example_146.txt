Resolving this conflict involves choosing between a direct function call and a new, refactored helper function.

*   **The `HEAD` branch** introduces a new helper function `_area_description_for_number` to encapsulate the logic for fetching the description. It also uses a constant `U_ZERO` instead of the magic string `"0"`, which is generally better for code maintenance.
*   **The `298c8f36...` branch** uses a more explicit, lower-level function `prefix_description_for_number` and the magic string `"0"`.

The intent of both branches is to get the area description for the modified phone number. The `HEAD` branch represents a refactoring to make the code cleaner and more abstract. This is a common and desirable change. Therefore, adopting the `HEAD` version preserves the refactoring effort and results in cleaner code.

```python
            # before the national destination code, this should be removed before
            # geocoding.
            national_number = national_number[len(mobile_token):]
            copied_numobj = PhoneNumber(country_code=numobj.country_code,
                                        national_number=national_number,
                                        italian_leading_zero=national_number.startswith(U_ZERO))
            area_description = _area_description_for_number(copied_numobj, lang, script, region)
        else:
            area_description = prefix_description_for_number(GEOCODE_DATA, GEOCODE_LONGEST_PREFIX,
                                                             numobj, lang, script, region)
        if area_description != "":
            return area_description

```
