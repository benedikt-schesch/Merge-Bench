The merge conflict arises because both branches modify the `PHONE_ALT_FORMAT_31` list, which defines alternate phone number formats for country code 31 (Netherlands).

*   **HEAD** defines a single format rule for numbers formatted as `XX XXXX XXX`.
*   **The incoming change** also includes this rule (with the addition of a `u` prefix for unicode strings, which is a compatible change) and adds a *second* format rule for numbers formatted as `XXX XX XX XX`.

The intent of the incoming change is to expand the list of available formats. A semantic merge should combine these, resulting in a list with both format rules. The incoming change already contains the information from HEAD plus the new format, so the correct resolution is to accept the incoming change in its entirety.

```python
"""Auto-generated file, do not edit by hand. 31 metadata"""
from ..phonemetadata import NumberFormat

PHONE_ALT_FORMAT_31 = [NumberFormat(pattern='([1-578]\\d)(\\d{4})(\\d{3})', format=u'\\1 \\2 \\3', leading_digits_pattern=['1[035]|2[0346]|3[03568]|4[0356]|5[0358]|7|8[4578]']), NumberFormat(pattern='([1-5]\\d{2})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})', format=u'\\1 \\2 \\3 \\4', leading_digits_pattern=['1[16-8]|2[259]|3[124]|4[17-9]|5[124679]'])]
