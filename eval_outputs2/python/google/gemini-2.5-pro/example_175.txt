This merge conflict involves two separate changes: one fixes a bug in an exception message, and the other adds a necessary line of code to read the packet's payload.

- **HEAD:** Introduces the line `d = self.recv(size-4)` to read the rest of the packet data after the header has been validated. However, its version of the `raise Exception` line uses incorrect variable names (`id`, `packetid`) in the error message.
- **Incoming Change (265b357...):** Corrects the `raise Exception` line to use the proper variables (`pid`, `self.packetid`) which match the check in the `if` condition. However, it is missing the new `d = self.recv(size-4)` line.

The correct resolution is to combine both intents: use the corrected exception message from the incoming change and include the new line of code from HEAD that reads the payload. This new line logically belongs after the `if` block that validates the header.

```python
            raise r
        h, d = r
        rcmd, size, pid = unpack("III", h)
        if rcmd != cmd+1 or pid != self.packetid or size <= 4:
            self.close()
            raise Exception("incorrect answer (%s!=%s, %s!=%s, %d<=4", 
                rcmd, cmd+1, pid, self.packetid, size)
        d = self.recv(size-4)
        if len(d) == 1 and ord(d[0]) != 0:
            raise Error(ord(d[0]))
        return d
