An analysis of the conflict reveals two different approaches to creating a version-agnostic MD5 hashing utility.

*   **The `HEAD` branch** introduces a variable named `hashFactory`. In the `try` block, it is assigned `hashlib.md5`. In the `except` block, it is assigned the `md5` module itself. This is likely a bug, as the intent was probably to assign `md5.new`, creating an inconsistency in how the factory would be used (`hashFactory()` vs. `hashFactory.new()`).
*   **The `b9658a26...` branch** opts for a more robust compatibility layer. It creates a `new` function and a `digest_size` constant, mirroring the API of the old `md5` module. This provides a consistent interface regardless of which underlying library is imported.

The most semantic resolution is to adopt the more complete and correct approach from the `b9658a26...` branch. We can complete its logic by adding the corresponding implementation in the `except` block, ensuring that `new` and `digest_size` are correctly aliased from the `md5` module when `hashlib` is not available. This combines the best of both intents: using the modern `hashlib` when possible while providing a consistent, backward-compatible API.

```python

try:
    # The md5 module is deprecated in Python 2.6, so use hashlib when possible.
    import hashlib

    def new(data=b("")):
         return hashlib.md5(data)
    digest_size = new().digest_size

except ImportError:
    import md5
    new = md5.new
    digest_size = md5.digest_size

```
