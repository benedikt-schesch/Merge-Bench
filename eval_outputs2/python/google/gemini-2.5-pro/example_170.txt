An expert in semantic merge conflict resolution would analyze the intent behind both conflicting changes.

*   **The `try` block's intent**: The code in the `try` block (from branch `b9658a26...`) uses the modern `hashlib` library (aliased as `new`). It dynamically retrieves the `digest_size` from a new hash instance, which is the preferred and modern approach.

*   **The `except` block's intent**: This block serves as a fallback for older Python versions that do not have `hashlib`. Both sides import the legacy `md5` module.
    *   **HEAD's intent**: To provide a `hashFactory` alias for the `md5` module for later use and to hardcode the known `digest_size` for MD5, which is 16. This is simple and robust.
    *   **b9658a26...**'s intent: To dynamically get the `digest_size` from the legacy module and then clean up the namespace by deleting the imported module. However, this implementation is buggy (it references a non-existent `digestsize` variable) and its goal of cleaning up the namespace would prevent other parts of the code from using the imported `md5` module, which contradicts HEAD's intent to create a `hashFactory`.

**Resolution:**
The most sensible resolution is to combine the modern approach from the `try` block with the safer and more functional fallback from the `HEAD` branch. The `HEAD` branch provides a working `hashFactory` and correctly identifies the digest size, which is likely the overall goal of this code block. The other branch's fallback is flawed and incomplete.

```python
    digest_size = new().digest_size

except ImportError:
    import md5
    hashFactory = md5

    digest_size = 16

```
