An expert in semantic merge conflict resolution would analyze the intent behind the changes on both sides of the conflict.

*   **`HEAD`'s Intent**: The code in `HEAD` has a docstring that starts with a lowercase 't' in 'Test'. It's also missing the body of the `except` block. This deletion is almost certainly a mistake, as an empty `except` block in a test that is explicitly designed to catch and validate an exception renders the test useless.
*   **`1fcf849f...`'s Intent**: This side capitalizes the first letter of the docstring, which is a common Python convention and a minor stylistic improvement.
*   **Combined Intent**: The overall goal of this function is to test that providing a `Number` with both an invalid precision and an invalid scale raises a `MultipleInvalid` exception containing two specific errors.

A semantic resolution should combine the stylistic improvement from one side with the logical correctness that was lost on the other side. The test must contain assertions to be meaningful. Based on the schema (`precision=6`, `scale=2`) and the input (`'123456.712'`), it is expected to raise two errors: one for the scale (3 > 2) and one for the precision (9 > 6). The assertions should reflect this. The `try...except...else` pattern is a common way to test for exceptions, where the `else` block asserts failure if no exception was raised.

```python
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise Invalid for String"


def test_number_validation_with_invalid_precision_invalid_scale():
    """Test with Number with invalid precision and scale"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(precision=6, scale=2)})
    try:
        schema({"number": '123456.712'})
    except MultipleInvalid as e:
        assert len(e.errors) == 2
        assert 'invalid scale' in str(e.errors[0])
        assert 'invalid precision' in str(e.errors[1])
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise MultipleInvalid for Number"

```
