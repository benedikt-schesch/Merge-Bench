This merge conflict arises from two different approaches to defining the `csv` function.

*   **The `HEAD` branch** defines `csv(querier, ...)`, intending for it to be a formatting function that receives a pre-populated `ScholarQuerier` object.
*   **The incoming branch `c5579c42...`** redefines `csv` to be a self-contained function that takes query parameters (`query`, `author`, `count`, etc.), creates its own `ScholarQuerier` object, and executes the query internally.

However, the code just above the conflict (the `txt` printer logic, also from the incoming branch) relies on a pre-existing `querier` object. To maintain a consistent design where querying is separate from formatting, the `HEAD` version is the more logical choice. This approach promotes code reuse, as a single query can be run once and then passed to multiple formatters (like the `txt` printer and the `csv` function).

The resolved code adopts the `HEAD` version's function signature, making it consistent with the surrounding code's pattern.

```python
>>>>>>> c5579c42facf5b55b3bcf7db98277b5504ffaeb2
    articles = querier.articles
    for art in articles:
        print(art.as_txt() + '\n')

def csv(querier, header=False, sep='|'):
    articles = querier.articles
    for art in articles:
        result = art.as_csv(header=header, sep=sep)
        print(encode(result))
        header = False

```
