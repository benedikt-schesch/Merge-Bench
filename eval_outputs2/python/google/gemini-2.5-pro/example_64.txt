This is a stylistic conflict where one side has formatted the function signature to be on a single line, and the other has formatted it to span multiple lines. The multi-line formatting is often preferred for readability, especially for longer signatures, and is a common output of code formatters like `black`.

The semantic intent is identical in both cases. Adopting the multi-line format improves readability and aligns with modern Python style guides.

```python
    ...                       Replace('hello', 'goodbye')))
    >>> validate('you say hello')
    'I say goodbye'
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        pattern: typing.Union[re.Pattern, str],
        substitution: str,
        msg: typing.Optional[str] = None,
    ) -> None:
        if isinstance(pattern, basestring):
            pattern = re.compile(pattern)
        self.pattern = pattern
        self.substitution = substitution
        self.msg = msg

```
