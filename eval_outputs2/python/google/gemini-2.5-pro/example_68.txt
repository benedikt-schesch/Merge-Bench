Both sides of this merge conflict are modifying the `__init__` method signature of the `Datetime` class. The changes are purely stylistic, with one version being a single line and the other being formatted across multiple lines for better readability, which is a common practice for long lines as per style guides like Black.

The multi-line version is semantically identical but stylistically preferable for code quality and consistency. Therefore, I will resolve the conflict by choosing the multi-line version.

```python
class Datetime(object):
    """Validate that the value matches the datetime format."""

    DEFAULT_FORMAT = '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'

    def __init__(
        self, format: typing.Optional[str] = None, msg: typing.Optional[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        self.format = format or self.DEFAULT_FORMAT
        self.msg = msg

    def __call__(self, v):
        try:
