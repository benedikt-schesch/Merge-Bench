I am unable to resolve this conflict as the intent is ambiguous. The `try...except` block is incomplete, and what should happen when the `MultipleInvalid` exception is caught is unclear from the provided context. Therefore, I am returning the snippet with the conflict markers unresolved.

```python
    out_ = schema({"number": '123456789012.00'})
    assert float(out_.get("number")) == 123456789012.00


def test_number_when_precision_none_n_invalid_scale_yield_decimal_true():

    schema = Schema({"number": Number(scale=2, yield_decimal=True)})
    try:
        schema({"number": '12345678901.234'})
    except MultipleInvalid as e:
