The semantic intent of both branches is to add phone number metadata. The `HEAD` branch adds a `number_format` entry. The other branch also adds the same `number_format` entry (with a minor, non-functional syntax difference of a `u` prefix for the string) and additionally sets `mobile_number_portable_region` to `True`.

The correct resolution is to combine these additions. We will include the `number_format` and also the `mobile_number_portable_region` flag. For consistency with the surrounding code, which doesn't use the `u` prefix for strings, we'll adopt the string format from the `HEAD` branch.

```python
    voip=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    pager=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    uan=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='51\\d{7}', possible_number_pattern='\\d{9}', example_number='511234567'),
    voicemail=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    no_international_dialling=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    number_format=[NumberFormat(pattern='([5-9]\\d{2})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})', format='\\1 \\2 \\3 \\4', leading_digits_pattern=['[568]|[79][0-8]'])],
    mobile_number_portable_region=True)

```
