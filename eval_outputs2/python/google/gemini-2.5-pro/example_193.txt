An analysis of the conflict reveals two independent, additive changes:

*   The `HEAD` branch's intent is to introduce logging into the module by creating a `logger` instance.
*   The other branch (`c7197d92...`) intends to add two new configuration options, `CONTEXT_FUNCTION` and `ALLOW_OPENID_SIGNUPS`, which are read from the Django settings.

Both changes are desirable and do not interfere with each other. The correct resolution is to combine them. For readability and to follow common Python conventions, related constants (especially those read from settings) are grouped together. The logger definition is also a module-level constant. The merge below combines these additions, grouping the settings-related constants together, followed by the logger definition, which preserves the intent and functionality of both branches.

```python
    'socialregistration.forms.UserForm')

INITAL_DATA_FUNCTION = getattr(settings, 'SOCIALREGISTRATION_INITIAL_DATA_FUNCTION',
    None)

CONTEXT_FUNCTION = getattr(settings, 'SOCIALREGISTRATION_SETUP_CONTEXT_FUNCTION',
    None)
ALLOW_OPENID_SIGNUPS = getattr(settings, 'SOCIALREGISTRATION_ALLOW_OPENID_SIGNUPS',
    True)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class Setup(SocialRegistration, View):
    """
    Setup view to create new Django users from third party APIs.
    """

```
