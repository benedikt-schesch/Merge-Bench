An analysis of the conflict reveals the following:

*   **HEAD** introduces a check for `font_type` being `"afm"` or `""`. It processes Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) files. The case for `""` seems incomplete as it would fall through without an `else` block.
*   **b789233592834f4078dd5d9b5c52bebe2f28ccbb** introduces a check for a `suffix` being `"afm"` or `"pfb"`. This version handles both parts of a Type 1 font: the metrics (`.afm`) and the font outline data (`.pfb`). If it finds an `.afm` file, it correctly looks for the corresponding `.pfb` file. If it finds a `.pfb` file directly, it uses it.

The intent of both branches is to handle Type 1 fonts. The incoming branch (`b789...`) is more complete and robust. It handles both required file types (`.afm` and `.pfb`) and uses a more descriptive variable `suffix`, which likely refers to the file extension. Therefore, the logic from the incoming branch is the correct resolution.

```python
                                addMapping(fontName, bold, italic, fullFontName)

                    # Register "normal" name and the place holder for style
                    self.registerFont(fontName, [*fontAlias, fullFontName])

            elif suffix in {"afm", "pfb"}:
                if suffix == "afm":
                    afm = file.getNamedFile()
                    tfile = pisaFileObject(baseName + ".pfb", basepath=file.basepath)
                    pfb = tfile.getNamedFile()
                else:
                    pfb = file.getNamedFile()

```
