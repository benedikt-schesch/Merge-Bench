An expert in semantic merge conflict resolution would analyze the intent behind the changes on both sides.

*   **`HEAD`'s Intent:** To explicitly import a comprehensive list of exception types from `voluptuous.error` and several key components from `voluptuous.schema_builder`. This is likely part of a feature addition or refactoring related to the `voluptuous` library.
*   **`1fcf849f...`'s Intent:** To add the standard `datetime` module for use in the file and to add a `# fmt: off` directive. This directive tells code formatters (like `black`) to ignore the following block, suggesting a deliberate, manual arrangement of imports.

**Resolution:**
The correct resolution is to combine both intents. The code needs all the specified imports, and the desire to manually control the import formatting should be respected. A standard convention (PEP 8) is to group imports: standard library first, then third-party libraries. This resolution follows that convention while incorporating all changes.

1.  Place the `# fmt: off` directive at the top, as intended by the branch.
2.  Add the `import datetime` from the branch.
3.  Add the `voluptuous` imports from `HEAD`.
4.  Keep the surrounding context unchanged.

This merge preserves the functionality and formatting instructions from both branches in a clean and conventional way.

```python
# fmt: off
import datetime

from voluptuous.error import (MultipleInvalid, CoerceInvalid, TrueInvalid, FalseInvalid, BooleanInvalid, Invalid,
                              AnyInvalid, AllInvalid, MatchInvalid, UrlInvalid, EmailInvalid, FileInvalid, DirInvalid,
                              RangeInvalid, PathInvalid, ExactSequenceInvalid, LengthInvalid, DatetimeInvalid,
                              DateInvalid, InInvalid, TypeInvalid, NotInInvalid, ContainsInvalid, NotEnoughValid,
                              TooManyValid)
