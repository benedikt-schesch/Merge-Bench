This merge conflict represents a divergence in the function's fundamental design.

*   **The `HEAD` branch** treats the function as a **generator**. In the case of an `AttributeError`, it either exits silently (`return`) for a specific URL or re-raises the exception (`raise e`). This is consistent with the `yield` statement present later in the code.

*   **The `d264377...` branch** treats the function as a **regular function that returns a pair of lists**. It returns empty lists (`[], []`) for the specific URL and uses a custom error-handling method (`self._error`) for other errors, which presumably also returns two lists or raises a custom exception. This branch comes from `contrib/weibo/parsers.py`, suggesting it's a contribution or refactoring being merged into the main application. This new implementation is more explicit about its return type and encapsulates error handling, which is generally an improvement.

The core of the conflict is whether the function should be a generator or return lists. The `d264377...` branch represents a deliberate refactoring to improve the function's contract and error handling. The most likely scenario is that this refactoring is the desired change, and the `yield` statement remaining in the merged code is an oversight that the developer would fix after resolving the conflict.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the more mature and intentional changes from the `d264377...` branch.

```python
            ul = html.find(attrs={'class': 'cnfList', 'node-type': 'userListBox'})
            if ul is None:
                ul = html.find(attrs={'class': 'follow_list', 'node-type': 'userListBox'})
        except AttributeError, e:
            if br.geturl().startswith('http://e.weibo.com'):
                return [], []
            return self._error(url, e)
        
        if ul is None:
            if is_follow is True:
                if is_new_mode:
                    yield 'http://weibo.com/%s/follow?relate=fans' % self.uid
