An expert semantic merge resolution involves understanding the intent of the changes from both branches and combining them in a way that is functionally correct, clean, and idiomatic for the language.

-   **HEAD's Intent:** To import plugins from `needle` and `nose` for testing purposes and to define a `baseline_filename` variable, likely for a visual regression test.
-   **Incoming's Intent:** To import the standard `sys` module, likely for system-level interactions.

The two sets of changes are not functionally in conflict. `HEAD` is adding testing-specific code, while the incoming change is adding a general-purpose system library. The correct resolution is to incorporate both changes.

For Pyhon, the best practice (as defined in PEP 8) is to group imports, ordering them as follows:
1.  Standard library imports (like `sys` and `os`).
2.  Related third-party imports (like `needle` and `nose`).

The resolved code combines the imports from both branches and applies this standard Python convention for clarity and maintainability. The `baseline_filename` variable from `HEAD` is also included, preserving the logical separation from the import block with blank lines.

```python
import sys
import os

from needle.plugin import NeedleCapturePlugin, SaveBaselinePlugin
from nose.plugins import PluginTester


baseline_filename = 'screenshots/baseline/red_box.png'

```
