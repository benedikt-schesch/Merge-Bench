This merge conflict involves a test method for importing an RSA private key from a PEM-formatted string.

-   The `HEAD` branch has a test named `testImportKey3` which uses the deprecated `self.failUnless` to assert the key has private components.
-   The incoming branch (`6fedd...`) renames the test to `testImportKey3unicode`, uses a `b()` wrapper function (a common pattern for Python 2/3 compatibility to ensure a byte string is passed), calls `RSA.importKey` directly, and uses a more modern `self.assertEqual(..., True)` assertion.

The semantic intent of the incoming branch is to make the test compatible with Python 3, where cryptographic functions require byte strings instead of unicode strings. The name change is likely secondary to this main goal. The call `self.rsa.importKey` (from HEAD) is consistent with the preceding test, suggesting `self.rsa` is an alias for the `RSA` module.

The best resolution is to combine these intents:
1.  Keep the original test name `testImportKey3` from `HEAD` for consistency.
2.  Incorporate the `b()` wrapper from the incoming branch, which is the crucial fix for Python 3 compatibility.
3.  Use the `self.rsa.importKey` call style for consistency with the surrounding code.
4.  Adopt the more modern `assertEqual` assertion from the incoming branch.

This approach applies the necessary compatibility fix while maintaining the original structure and naming of the test suite.

```python
        key = self.rsa.importKey(self.rsaPublicKeyDER)
        self.failIf(key.has_private())
        self.assertEqual(key.n, self.n)
        self.assertEqual(key.e, self.e)

    def testImportKey3(self):
        key = self.rsa.importKey(b(self.rsaKeyPEM))
        self.assertEqual(key.has_private(), True)
        self.assertEqual(key.n, self.n)
        self.assertEqual(key.e, self.e)
        self.assertEqual(key.d, self.d)
        self.assertEqual(key.p, self.p)
        self.assertEqual(key.q, self.q)
