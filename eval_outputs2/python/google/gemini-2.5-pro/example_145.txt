An analysis of the two branches indicates that they are both adding a new build script name to a list of scripts that should trigger a specific code path to handle a circular dependency during the build process.

*   The `HEAD` branch adds the script `buildgeocodingdata.py` and uses a Python 3-style `prnt` function.
*   The `298c8f3...` branch adds the script `buildprefixdata.py` and uses a Python 2-style `print` statement.

The semantic intent is to allow the overall build process to succeed even a script is added. The correct resolution is to combine the conditions by including both new script names. Additionally, adopting the Python 3-compatible `prnt` function from the `HEAD` branch is the more forward-looking choice.

```python
    # The generation process imports this module, creating a circular
    # dependency.  The hack below works around this.
    import os
    import sys
    if (os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildmetadatafromxml.py" or
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildgeocodingdata.py" or
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildprefixdata.py"):
        prnt("Failed to import generated data (but OK as during autogeneration)", file=sys.stderr)
        GEOCODE_DATA = {'1': {'en': u('United States')}}
        GEOCODE_LONGEST_PREFIX = 1
        LOCALE_DATA = {'US': {'en': u('United States')}}
    else:
        raise
