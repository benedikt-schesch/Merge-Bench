The two sides of this merge conflict are semantically identical. Both branches intend to raise a `RangeInvalid` exception with the same message when a `TypeError` is caught. The only difference is in the code formatting (a single line versus a multi-line statement). Since the functionality is the same, we can resolve the conflict by choosing one of the two versions.

```python

            return v

        # Objects that have no length e.g. None or strings will raise TypeError
        except TypeError:
            raise RangeInvalid(
                self.msg or 'invalid value or type')

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Length(min=%s, max=%s)' % (self.min, self.max)
