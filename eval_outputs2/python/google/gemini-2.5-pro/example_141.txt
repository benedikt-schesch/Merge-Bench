An analysis of the conflict reveals that both branches are modifying the `PHONE_ALT_FORMAT_359` list, which contains alternative formatting rules for Bulgarian phone numbers.

-   **HEAD**: This branch adds a single formatting rule for 9-digit numbers starting with `48`, `87`-`89`, `90`, or `98`. The format is `XXX XXX XXX`.
-   **`0336e19...`**: This branch is more comprehensive. It includes the exact same rule as `HEAD` and adds two more:
    1.  A format for numbers starting with `2` (likely Sofia landlines): `X XXX XX XX`.
    2.  An additional format for the same 9-digit numbers covered in `HEAD`: `XXX XX XX XX`.

The semantic intent of the `0336e19...` branch is to provide a more complete set of alternative formatting rules. Since it contains the rule from `HEAD` and adds others, the correct resolution is to accept the more comprehensive version from the `0336e19...` branch. This merge incorporates the work from both branches.
