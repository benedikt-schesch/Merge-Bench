The semantic intent of both branches is to add a build script's filename to a list of exceptions that are allowed to fail an import during the build process, preventing a circular dependency.

*   The `HEAD` branch adds `buildgeocodingdata.py` and attempts to use a Python 3-style print function (with a typo, `prnt`).
*   The `298c8f361a29b79085d5f926a70e863e056a33a5` branch adds `buildprefixdata.py` and uses a Python 2-style print statement.

A proper resolution combines these two intents by adding both filenames to the condition. It also standardizes on the more modern Python 3 `print` function syntax and corrects the typo from the `HEAD` branch.

```python
    # The generation process imports this module, creating a circular
    # dependency.  The hack below works around this.
    import os
    import sys
    if (os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildmetadatafromxml.py" or
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildgeocodingdata.py" or
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildprefixdata.py"):
        print("Failed to import generated data (but OK as during autogeneration)", file=sys.stderr)
        _ALT_NUMBER_FORMATS = {}
    else:
        raise
