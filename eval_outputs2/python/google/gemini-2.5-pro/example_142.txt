An analysis of the conflict reveals that both branches are attempting to define an alternate phone number format for the country code 62 (Indonesia).

*   The `HEAD` branch defines a pattern `(\\d{2})(\\d{4})(\\d{4})` which is intended for 10-digit numbers, grouped as 2-4-4.
*   The `0336e191...` branch defines a pattern `(\\d{2})(\\d{3,4})(\\d{4})` which is more flexible, handling both 9-digit (2-3-4) and 10-digit (2-4-4) numbers. This is a clear improvement as it supports more variations of Indonesian landline numbers.

The change in the `0336e191...` branch appears to be an intentional and more comprehensive update to the formatting rule. Therefore, the most logical resolution is to accept the version from that branch, as it encompasses and improves upon the intent of the `HEAD` branch.

```python
"""Auto-generated file, do not edit by hand. 62 metadata"""
from ..phonemetadata import NumberFormat

PHONE_ALT_FORMAT_62 = [NumberFormat(pattern='(\\d{2})(\\d{3,4})(\\d{4})', format=u'\\1 \\2', leading_digits_pattern=['2[124]|[36]1'])]
