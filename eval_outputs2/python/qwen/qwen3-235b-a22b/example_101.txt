In this case, the merge conflict is centered around a single line where the `HEAD` branch adds an `import coverage` statement, while the conflicting branch (referenced by hash `d5fc415e7e1577bce484d7d024020d40cebe81de`) leaves the line empty. This type of scenario is common in merges when one side adds functionality relying on a new import, and the other branch does not modify that particular line.

### Semantic Intent Analysis

- The **`import coverage`** line introduces the `coverage` module, which is typically used for monitoring test coverage in Python projects.
- The `prepare_config()` function is introduced immediately after this block of imports, implying that this setup may involve tests or profiling code that depends on `coverage`.
- Since the `HEAD` branch explicitly added this import, it's safe to assume that some logic within this branch is intended to use the `coverage` module.
- The other branch simply left it blank (indicating no modification, or perhaps a different intended structure). But importantly, this branch does **not actively remove** or alter the line.

---

### Decision

Given the standard import order and structure in Python, **including the `coverage` import** ensures the code added in the `HEAD` branch functions as intended. Moreover, since there's no conflicting import or logic indicating why this should be removed (or what might conflict), retaining the `import coverage` statement aligns with the semantic intent of the contributing code from the `HEAD` branch.

There is no ambiguity provided that the inclusion of `coverage` is intentional and doesn't clash with other functionality in the other side of the merge.

### Final Resolved Snippet

Here is the snippet with the semantic conflict resolved:

```python
try:
    from cStringIO import StringIO
except ImportError:
    from io import StringIO
from contextlib import contextmanager
import coverage
from functools import reduce


def prepare_config():
    """This function, used before importing ivre.db, will make IVRE
```
