The merge conflict in the provided code arises from two different branches modifying the same section of the file. One branch introduced a `logger`, while the other introduced two configuration settings: `CONTEXT_FUNCTION` and `ALLOW_OPENID_SIGNUPS`. These are all valid and non-overlapping changes.

---

**Semantic Analysis and Resolution Strategy:**

- `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
  - This is typically used for logging within the module and is important for debugging or auditing.
  
- `CONTEXT_FUNCTION = getattr(...)`
  - This is used to define an optional function that provides additional context for setting up a user.
  
- `ALLOW_OPENID_SIGNUPS = getattr(...)`
  - This controls whether new users are allowed to sign up via OpenID.

These three items have clear, independent purposes and should not override each other. Merging them means including **all three**, preserving the original formatting and spacing exactly as they were provided, and ensuring that no logic is lost.

Here is the **fully resolved merge conflict**, with all semantic changes applied, and the original context strictly preserved:

```python
    'socialregistration.forms.UserForm')

INITAL_DATA_FUNCTION = getattr(settings, 'SOCIALREGISTRATION_INITIAL_DATA_FUNCTION',
    None)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

CONTEXT_FUNCTION = getattr(settings, 'SOCIALREGISTRATION_SETUP_CONTEXT_FUNCTION',
    None)

ALLOW_OPENID_SIGNUPS = getattr(settings, 'SOCIALREGISTRATION_ALLOW_OPENID_SIGNUPS',
    True)

class Setup(SocialRegistration, View):
    """
    Setup view to create new Django users from third party APIs.
    """
```
