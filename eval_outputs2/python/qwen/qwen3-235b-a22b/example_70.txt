Hereâ€™s the full snippet with the conflict resolved, preserving the surrounding context and spacing exactly as provided:

```python


class NotIn(object):
    """Validate that a value is not in a collection."""

    def __init__(
        self, container: typing.Iterable, msg: typing.Optional[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        self.container = container
        self.msg = msg

    def __call__(self, v):
        try:

```

### Resolution Notes

- The only difference between the two sides of the merge conflict was a formatting choice: whether to represent the parameters of the `__init__` method inline (as in `HEAD`) or split them across multiple lines (as in the other branch).
- The **semantics** of both sides are absolutely identical: the method initializes an instance with `container` and an optional `msg`, storing them as instance attributes.
- The primary consideration in resolving this conflict is **readability** and **code maintainability**. The multi-line version improves readability and makes diffs cleaner, which is often preferred in larger codebases.
- Despite no semantic ambiguity, a formatting choice like this often reflects a code style convention within a team or project. Since the multi-line definition is more readable and does not affect code behavior, it was selected as the resolved version.
- The spacing and indentation of all other lines, as well as the surrounding context, were preserved per the instruction.
