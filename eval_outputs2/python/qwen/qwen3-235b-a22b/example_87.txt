```python
                'host': host,
                'pid':pid,
                'w':str(w)
            }
            item['queue'] = w.job().get('queue')
            if 'queue' in data:
                item['data'] = True
                item['code'] = data['payload']['class']
                item['runat'] = str(datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(float(data['run_at'])))
            else:
                item['data'] = False

```

The semantic merge conflict is resolved by choosing `if 'queue' in data:` as the modern and preferred Python idiom for checking dictionary key existence. The `has_key()` method was deprecated in Python 2.7 and removed in Python 3.x, while the `in` operator works consistently in both Python 2 and Python 3. Both conditions express the same intent (checking for a key in the dictionary), but the `in` operator remains the preferred and future-proof solution.
