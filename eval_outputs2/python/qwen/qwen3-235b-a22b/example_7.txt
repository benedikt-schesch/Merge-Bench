The merge conflict reflects differing approaches to specifying the right spacing value in a layout. The `HEAD` version uses a variable `right_spacer`, implying a preference for maintainability or consistency with other parts of the code that may also refer to this variable. The alternate branch introduces a hardcoded value of `10`, which could indicate an explicit intent to define the margin or a simplification.

Without further context about whether `right_spacer` is guaranteed to equal `10` or whether it may vary (or change in a future refactor), the semantic intent behind the choice is ambiguous.

Given the instructions to return the exact conflicting snippet if the resolution is unclear, here is the original code snippet with the unresolved conflict preserved:

```python
            return

        button = ProgressButton(self, -1, label)
        button.Bind(wx.EVT_LEFT_UP, handler)
        self.AddEvents(button)
<<<<<<< HEAD
        self.buttonSizer.Add(button, 0, wx.ALIGN_CENTER_VERTICAL|wx.RIGHT, right_spacer)
=======
        self.buttonSizer.Add(button, 0, wx.ALIGN_CENTER_VERTICAL | wx.RIGHT, 10)
>>>>>>> d523b6a054acb6d09befd78a9bc3897d48454bcd
        self.Layout()
        self.ShowSelected()
        return button

    def ShowSelected(self):
