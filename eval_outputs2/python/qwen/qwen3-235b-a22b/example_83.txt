The merge conflict occurs in a comment line describing the purpose of subsequent code that modifies file content. The difference lies only in the leading whitespace — spaces (in the `HEAD`) versus a tab (in the other commit). Since the surrounding code consistently uses spaces for indentation (as seen in the previous lines), maintaining consistency with Python best practices (which recommend using 4 spaces for indentation) is crucial here to avoid potential `IndentationError`.

The intent from both branches appears identical — indicating that a domain replacement logic will follow this comment if `--new-domain` is specified. Therefore, the correct resolution is to use the `HEAD` version’s indentation style to preserve consistency and correctness with respect to Python syntax and project conventions.

Here is the full, resolved snippet with the conflict removed and the code preserved exactly as required:

```python
                print "fixing links in ", filepath
                newtext = fixLinks(filetext, parser)
                with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
                    f.write(newtext)

        # fix all localhost references, if new domain given
        if arguments['--new-domain']:
            filetypes = ['*.html', '*.xml', '*.xsl', 'robots.txt']
            for root, dirs, filenames in os.walk(static_path):
                for extension in filetypes:
                    for filename in fnmatch.filter(filenames, extension):
```
