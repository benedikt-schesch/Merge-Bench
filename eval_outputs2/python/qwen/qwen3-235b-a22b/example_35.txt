To resolve the merge conflict in the provided test code, we need to examine the **syntax and behavior** of the `pytest.raises` context manager, which is typically used to assert that a block of code raises an expected exception.

---

### Original (HEAD) Version (with conflict):
```python
with raises(Invalid):
    schema([1, 2, 3])
except Invalid:
    assert True
else:
    assert False, "Did not raise Invalid"
```

This code **tries** to assert that the schema raises an `Invalid` exception when passed an invalid input, but it **misuses exception handling** by placing an `except` block immediately after the `with` block. This is **invalid Python syntax**—you cannot have an `except` directly follow a `with` without a preceding `try`.

Using `pytest.raises` correctly requires that the exception handling is already built into the context manager. If the code inside the `with` block does not raise the expected exception, a failure is triggered automatically. Therefore, there’s no need to manually catch the exception via `except`.

---

### Merging Version (from commit `1fcf849...`)
In the merging branch, the `except` and `else` blocks were **deleted**, resulting in the cleaner:
```python
with raises(Invalid):
    schema([1, 2, 3])
```

This represents a **correct use** of `pytest.raises`, and this is consistent with best practices.

---

### Conclusion

The correct semantic resolution is to remove the invalid `except` and `else` blocks. The intention of both parties appears to be verifying that the schema raises an `Invalid` exception when given three items. The merging version achieves that goal more correctly.

### Final Resolved Code Snippet

```python
def test_exact_sequence():
    schema = Schema(ExactSequence([int, int]))
    with raises(Invalid):
        schema([1, 2, 3])
    assert schema([1, 2]) == [1, 2]


def test_required():
    """Verify that Required works."""
