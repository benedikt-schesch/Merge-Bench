The merge conflict lies between two versions of the `install_proxy` function, where one intends to install the proxy and the other modifies supervisor configuration and prints a message unrelated to installing the proxy.

The original function name `install_proxy` and its docstring clearly convey the intent to install Cozy Proxy. The HEAD version directly aligns with this intent using `sudo('cozy-monitor install proxy')` followed by a confirmation print statement. Conversely, the other version performs a supervisor configuration update and prints a message about Redis being uninstalled — which is completely unrelated to the task of installing the proxy.

Given the semantics and the clear intent behind `install_proxy`, the HEAD version alone reflects the purpose and appropriate implementation of this function. There’s no alignment between the alternate implementation and the function's declared intent — the alternate version could be incorrect or related to an unrelated function.

Accordingly, the correct resolution of the conflict is to retain the contents from the HEAD version and discard the unrelated changes.

```python
@task
def install_proxy():
    """
    Install Cozy Proxy
    """
    sudo('cozy-monitor install proxy')
    print(green("Proxy successfully installed"))

@task
def install_apps():
    """
    Install Cozy Notes and Cozy Todos

```
