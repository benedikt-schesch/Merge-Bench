The provided merge conflict is purely stylistic, revolving around line breaks within a function signature, but retains the same semantic meaning between both versions. Both branches define a `__init__` method with identical parameters and logic within the method body.

Since the functional intent is clearly aligned and the only difference is formatting, resolving this conflict safely can be done by selecting the version that improves readabilityâ€”especially useful if parameters are long or multiple, as broken across lines. In this case, the version from the remote commit offers better clarity with each parameter on its own line.

Here is the resolved snippet, fully preserving the surrounding context:

```python
    ['hourly_report', 10, [], []]
    >>> validate(('hourly_report', 10, [], []))
    ('hourly_report', 10, [], [])
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        validators: typing.Iterable[Schemable],
        msg: typing.Optional[str] = None,
        **kwargs,
    ) -> None:
        self.validators = validators
        self.msg = msg
        self._schemas = [Schema(val, **kwargs) for val in validators]

    def __call__(self, v):
