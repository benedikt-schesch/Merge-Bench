The merge conflict was a difference in dictionary syntax (single-line vs multi-line positional notation). Both variations are semantically equivalent: both specify the same `'disabled'` attribute on a `TextInput` field. Since the intent and runtime functionality are the same, it's safe to preserve the multi-line format with a trailing commaâ€”a common style choice in codebases using structured formatting or linters that prefer trailing commas.

Here is the resolved code with the full context preserved as requested:

```python
        help_text=u'This is the standard text input',
    )
    disabled = forms.CharField(
        max_length=100,
        help_text=u'I am read only',
        widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={
            'disabled': 'disabled',
        })
    )
    content = forms.ChoiceField(
        choices=(
            ("text", "Plain text"),
            ("html", "HTML"),
```
