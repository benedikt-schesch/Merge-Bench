The function signature conflict involves a change in a function parameter's default value: `hashtag=None` vs. `hashtag=''`.

Examining the purpose of the `paginate` function, `hashtag` is likely used to construct navigation links with anchor points. The default value choice, `None` versus an empty string, carries semantic distinctions:

- `None` as a default typically implies "not provided" â€” possibly excluded from output or specially handled.
- An empty string `''` implies "an anchor that does nothing", and depending on HTML behavior, could produce visible `#` in URLs without further checks.

Without view into the function's internal handling of `hashtag`, it's impossible to determine whether one is functionally equivalent or superior to the other in context. Furthermore, changing from `None` to `''` could subtly break code that expects a `None` check, and vice versa.

Since the functional intent of either change cannot be semantically validated with only this minimal context, and since this choice could impact behavior, the correct resolution in this case is to preserve both versions of the conflict and defer further resolution to a reviewer or the development team.

```python
            context[key] = page_obj.object_list
        context['paginator'] = paginator
        context['page_obj'] = page_obj
        return u''
