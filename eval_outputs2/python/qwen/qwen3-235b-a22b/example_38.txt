The merge conflict presented is in the form of a docstring for a test case, documenting a GitHub pull request. The content in question is the URL to the PR (`https://github.com/alecthomas/voluptuous/pull/434`). The only difference is in the formatting of the link:

- One side uses angle brackets around the URL (`<https://...>`), often used in Markdown to indicate a URL as-is without hyperlinking.
- The other side uses the raw string without special syntax.

Semantically and functionally, **both versions convey the exact same piece of information**—a reference to a GitHub PR. The test code itself (including all logic and assertions) is unaffected by the contents of its docstring.

In Python projects, docstrings often include references in plain URLs or issue numbers (e.g., `#434`) without the need for Markdown syntax. Additionally, there's no indication from the surrounding context that this URL is part of any documentation engine or linter rule that requires formatting.

Since the only difference is in minor stylistic formatting and there is no disambiguating context or comment from developers about preferred style, **the both options are semantically equivalent and there is no clear intent driving resolution**.

✅ Therefore, as the intention behind the code remains ambiguous, and both versions fulfill the same purpose equally well, the correct action is to return the code snippet in its conflicted form.

        assert False, "Did not raise correct Invalid"
