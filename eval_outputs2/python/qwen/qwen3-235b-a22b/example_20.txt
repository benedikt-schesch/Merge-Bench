The merge conflict involves adding a `# fmt: off` directive in one branch and not in the other. Given that the purpose of `# fmt: off` is typically to disable code formatting tools (e.g., Black) locally, the intent is to preserve the following code's formatting as manually adjusted.

However, since the provided code ends just after this line and does not show what formatting would be preserved, the impact or necessity of `# fmt: off` cannot be evaluated with certainty. Without further context or code illustrating formatting sensitivities, keeping the merge conflict markers is appropriate, allowing the developer to evaluate and resolve based on the formatting rules and intentions for the codebase.
