The merge conflict in this code involves two separate but related changes that must be combined to achieve the full intended behavior of the code. Let's analyze each part and then provide the resolution.

### ðŸ§  **Analysis of the Merge Conflict**

1. **Print Statement Conflict**:
   - `HEAD` version uses `print(s)`, which is valid Python 3 syntax.
   - Incoming change uses `print s`, valid Python 2 syntax.
   - Since `print(s)` from `HEAD` aligns with modern Python standards (assuming a Python 3-only codebase), it should be preserved.

2. **Intent Behind the Code**:
   - Both versions agree on printing the summary after gathering it in a loop.
   - The incoming change adds the `exit_code` logic that sets and sends an appropriate exit status based on `tests_pass`. This functionality is essential for controlling the script's behavior upon completion and should be included.

---

### ðŸ§© **Merged Intent**

The goal is to:
- Print the summary.
- Exit the program with code `0` if tests pass, else `1`.

Therefore, the merged code should:
- Retain the Python 3 compatible `print(s)` inside the loop.
- Include the `exit_code` assignment and `sys.exit(exit_code)` after the loop.

### âœ… **Resolved Code Snippet**

Here is the **fully resolved** snippet in the markdown format as requested, with the conflict markers removed and the code properly merged:

```python
>>>>>>> 99c62cf1a302570fa18cbf8ccb9c451c1bdb58d4
            summary.append(s)

print('\nSummary:')
for s in summary:
    print(s)
exit_code = 0 if tests_pass else 1
sys.exit(exit_code)
>>>>>>> 99c62cf1a302570fa18cbf8ccb9c451c1bdb58d4
```

Note: The outer `>>>>>>>` markers appear to be redundant or a result of duplicate conflict markers in the input. Since the instruction says to preserve the **context as is**, they are retained except for resolving the actual conflict inside.
