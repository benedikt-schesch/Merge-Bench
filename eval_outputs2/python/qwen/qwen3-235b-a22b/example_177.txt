The merge conflict arises between two version number declarations. To resolve, we must align with the stated policy that the version should reflect the `<next release version>.dev`. Since `2.9.0.dev` is numerically newer than `2.8.25.dev`, it reflects a more up-to-date version of the software that aligns with the expected "next release" in the projectâ€™s development lifecycle.

The semantic intent of the `__version__` field is to indicate the current development state for the forthcoming release, with `.dev` marking it as a placeholder for pre-release development activity. Given this, **resolving in favor of `2.9.0.dev`** is appropriate as it reflects a forward-moving release strategy.

Here is the resolved code snippet:

```python

The version should always be set to the <next release version>.dev
The jenkins release job will automatically strip the .dev for release,
and update the version again for continued development.
"""
__version__ = '2.9.0.dev'

```
