The merge conflict resides in the intended version number that should be assigned to `__version__`. Here's a breakdown of the two proposed versions:

- **HEAD**: `__version__ = '2.2a1'` suggests an alpha release of version 2.2, likely reflecting forward progress in development toward a new minor version with potential new features or breaking changes.

- **Other branch**: `__version__ = '2.1.2a1'` indicates an alpha build for a patch version 2.1.2, typically aligned with a maintenance or bug-fix branch for an existing stable minor version.

---

Given semantic versioning implications and absence of further context about which direction represents the correct release branch intent (feature development vs. stabilization patch), this decision should involve a human judgment call rather than automated resolution.

Therefore, the correct step is to retain the original merge conflict markers to indicate the unresolved issue.
