I'll resolve this semantic merge conflict by preserving both the detailed help text from HEAD and the new field from the other branch. Here's the resolved version:

```python
    return {
        'exclusive_subpages': forms.BooleanField(
            label=capfirst(_('exclusive subpages')),
            required=False,
            initial=form.instance.parameters.get('exclusive_subpages', False),
            help_text=_(
                'Exclude everything other than the application\'s content'
                ' when rendering subpages.'),
        ),
        'custom_field': forms.CharField(),
    }


Page.create_content_type(
    ApplicationContent,
```

Resolution reasoning:
1. Kept the more descriptive help text from HEAD branch for 'exclusive_subpages'
2. Added the new 'custom_field' from the other branch
3. Maintained proper dictionary structure with comma separation between fields
4. Preserved all context outside the conflict markers

The solution combines both changes semantically:
- The improved help text explains the functionality better
- The new custom_field adds functionality without affecting existing fields
- Both changes are compatible and serve different purposes
