            "APPNAME": ABE_APPNAME,
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. Both `no_update` (from HEAD) and `logging` (from other branch) are new keys added in the same position
2. Since they represent independent configuration options and don't conflict semantically:
   - `no_update` likely controls update behavior
   - `logging` likely controls logging behavior
3. Both can coexist in the configuration dictionary
4. Order doesn't affect functionality (Python dicts preserve insertion order), so we maintain:
   - HEAD's `no_update` first (as it appeared in current branch)
   - Followed by other branch's `logging` (as it appeared in incoming branch)
5. All original spacing and formatting is preserved
