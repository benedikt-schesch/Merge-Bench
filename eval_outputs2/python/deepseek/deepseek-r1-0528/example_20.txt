The conflict arises because one branch adds the `# fmt: off` directive while the other branch doesn't have it. Since the comment only affects code formatting tools and doesn't change runtime behavior, but its presence/absence could impact developer workflows and style consistency, the resolution is ambiguous without knowing the project's formatting policies. 

In this situation, I'll preserve the conflict markers since the semantic intent isn't clear (whether the project wants formatting disabled globally). Developers need to decide which approach aligns with their style guide.

```python
