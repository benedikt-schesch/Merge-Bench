The merge conflict in the provided code snippet appears to be purely stylistic, involving an intentional addition of a blank line by one branch versus no blank line in the other branch. Since blank lines have no semantic impact on code execution and both versions are syntactically correct, the conflict retains identical behavior in either resolution. 

Since the requirement emphasizes returning the original snippet when intent is ambiguous, and there's no semantic motivation to favor one styling choice over the other, the conflict is preserved as-is.

```python
    assert extended.schema == {'a': {'b': str, 'c': float, 'e': int}, 'd': str}


def test_schema_extend_handles_schema_subclass():
    """Verify that Schema.extend handles a subclass of Schema"""
