I've analyzed the merge conflict in the `save` method. The key differences are:
1. Connection retrieval method: `get_connection` vs `connections.get_connection`
2. Return behavior: void call vs returning the result

After considering the semantics:
- The connection method change appears to be a refactoring to use a connections manager
- The return value addition provides useful feedback to callers
- These changes are compatible and complementary

Here's the resolved version preserving all context:

```python
        if self.order is not None:
            d['order'] = self.order
        return d

    def save(self, using=None):
        es = connections.get_connection(using or self._index._using)
        return es.indices.put_template(name=self._template_name, body=self.to_dict())

class Index(object):
    def __init__(self, name, using='default'):
        """
        :arg name: name of the index
```
