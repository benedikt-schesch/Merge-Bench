I've analyzed the semantic merge conflict between the two versions of the `prepend` method. Here's the resolution:

1. Type Annotation: `typing.List[typing.Hashable]` is more flexible and inclusive than `typing.List[str]` since hashable types include strings, numbers, and tuples. This maintains compatibility with both branches.

2. Attribute Assignment: The context shows the class uses `self.path` (in `__str__` method and original assignment). The other branch's `self._path` appears to be an incomplete refactor since it still references `self.path` in the assignment. Using `self.path` maintains consistency.

Here's the resolved code with full context preserved:

```python
        output = Exception.__str__(self)
        if self.error_type:
            output += ' for ' + self.error_type
        return output + path

    def prepend(self, path: typing.List[typing.Hashable]) -> None:
        self.path = path + self.path

class MultipleInvalid(Invalid):
    def __init__(self, errors: typing.Optional[typing.List[Invalid]] = None) -> None:
        self.errors = errors[:] if errors else []
```

Key resolution points:
- Combined the more general type annotation (`typing.Hashable`)
- Kept the attribute name as `self.path` for consistency
- Preserved all surrounding context exactly
- Maintained original spacing and formatting

This resolution:
✅ Maintains compatibility with both branches
✅ Keeps type flexibility while preserving string functionality
✅ Maintains attribute consistency throughout the class
✅ Avoids introducing new inconsistencies from partial refactors
