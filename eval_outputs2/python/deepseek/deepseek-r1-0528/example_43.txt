```python

    assert float(out_.get("number")) == 1234.00


def test_number_when_precision_scale_none_yield_decimal_true():
    """Test with Number with no precision and scale"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(yield_decimal=True)})

    assert out_.get("number") == 12345678901234



```

The conflict was merely stylistic - a spacing difference in the docstring. Both versions express identical semantic intent regarding the functionality being tested. 

Resolved by selecting the version without the extra space after `"""` as it aligns with standard Python docstring conventions (PEP 8). The conflict resolution preserves:
1. The test name and purpose
2. Schema instantiation
3. Test assertions 
4. All surrounding context and formatting

The merge captures both sets of changes since they express the same test functionality - the only difference was docstring formatting.
