The conflict arises from two different approaches to testing exception handling. The receiving branch (HEAD) uses try-except logic to assert the exception message, while the incoming branch uses `pytest.raises` context manager to check the number of errors. The correct resolution combines the strengths of both approaches:

1. Keeps `pytest.raises` context manager to verify exception type and message pattern
2. Adds explicit check for error count from incoming branch
3. Removes redundant try-except block which was incorrect outside context manager

Resolved code maintains pytest best practices while validating both error message pattern and error count:

```python
    schema(frozenset(['abc']))
    schema(frozenset([42, 'abc']))

    with pytest.raises(MultipleInvalid, match="invalid value in frozenset") as ctx:
        schema(frozenset([None]))
    assert len(ctx.value.errors) == 1

def test_lower_util_handles_various_inputs():
    assert Lower(3) == "3"
    assert Lower(u"3") == u"3"
```
