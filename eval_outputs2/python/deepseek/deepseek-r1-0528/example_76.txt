The conflict arises from differing type annotations for the `path` parameter in the `_run` method. Both branches are attempting to define the same method, but with different type specifications for the `path` argument. 

After analyzing the intent:
1. The HEAD branch specifies `path` as `typing.List[str]` (list of strings)
2. The other branch specifies `path` as `typing.List[typing.Hashable]` (list of hashable objects)

The `typing.Hashable` version is more flexible since:
- Strings are hashable, so it's backward-compatible
- It allows other hashable types (like integers) in the path
- This better matches typical validation path usage where paths might contain mixed types (string keys and integer indices)

Resolution:
Keep the more flexible `typing.Hashable` annotation while preserving the identical method body from both branches.

Resolved code:
```python
            schema.required = self.required
            self._compiled.append(schema._compile(v))
        schema.required = old_required
        return self._run

    def _run(self, path: typing.List[typing.Hashable], value):
        if self.discriminant is not None:
            self._compiled = [
                self.schema._compile(v)
                for v in self.discriminant(value, self.validators)
            ]

```
