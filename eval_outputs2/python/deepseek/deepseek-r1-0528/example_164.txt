The conflict arises from different approaches to handling the `externKey` parameter. The HEAD branch unconditionally converts `externKey` and `passphrase` to bytes, while the other branch conditionally converts only PEM-formatted unicode keys. The resolution preserves both intents by:

1. Keeping the passphrase conversion from HEAD
2. First converting unicode PEM keys using the other branch's method
3. Then converting any remaining non-bytes keys using HEAD's `tobytes` method
4. Maintaining all existing comments and spacing

This ensures:
- PEM keys are properly handled with ASCII encoding
- Non-PEM keys get bytes conversion
- Passphrase is always converted when present
- The subsequent PEM check works reliably

Resolved code:
```python
        :Type passphrase: string
        
        :Raise ValueError/IndexError/TypeError:
            When the given key cannot be parsed (possibly because the pass phrase is wrong).
        """
        if passphrase is not None:
            passphrase = tobytes(passphrase)

        if isinstance(externKey, unicode) and externKey.startswith("-----"):
            # Convert unicode to bytes for PEM encoded keys
            externKey = externKey.encode('ascii')
        elif not isinstance(externKey, bytes):
            externKey = tobytes(externKey)

        if externKey.startswith(b('-----')):
                # This is probably a PEM encoded key
                lines = externKey.replace(b(" "),b('')).split()
                keyobj = None
```
