The conflict arises from differences in formatting the `RangeInvalid` exception message. Both sides intend to raise an exception with the same message when a type error occurs, but use different formatting styles for the parentheses.

After analyzing:
1. The semantic intent is identical - both want to raise an exception with a customizable error message
2. The formatting difference is purely stylistic
3. The version with the parenthesis on a new line provides better consistency with the surrounding code's multi-line formatting style
4. The resolution maintains the exact error message text while improving readability

Resolved version:

```python
            return v

        # Objects that lack a partial ordering, e.g. None or strings will raise TypeError
        except TypeError:
            raise RangeInvalid(
                self.msg or 'invalid value or type (must have a partial ordering)'
            )

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Range(min=%r, max=%r, min_included=%r, max_included=%r, msg=%r)' % (
            self.min,
            self.max,
```
