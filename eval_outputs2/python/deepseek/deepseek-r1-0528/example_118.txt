I'll resolve this conflict by merging both import statements to include all profile models. Here's the corrected snippet:

```python
import simplejson as json
from rest_framework.renderers import JSONRenderer
from rest_framework.parsers import JSONParser

# Models
from hackathon.models import Snippet, Profile, InstagramProfile, TwitterProfile, MeetupToken, GithubProfile, LinkedinProfile, FacebookProfile, GoogleProfile, TumblrProfile
from hackathon.serializers import SnippetSerializer
from hackathon.forms import UserForm


profile_track = None

```

### Resolution Explanation:
1. **Semantic Analysis**: Both branches are adding new profile types to the import statement:
   - HEAD branch adds `GoogleProfile`
   - Other branch adds `TumblrProfile`
   
2. **Non-conflicting Changes**: These are complementary additions rather than conflicting changes since they:
   - Serve different platforms (Google vs Tumblr)
   - Don't modify existing imports
   - Don't affect the same logical component

3. **Merge Strategy**: Combine both new imports while preserving:
   - Alphabetical order (maintained naturally as `GoogleProfile` comes before `TumblrProfile`)
   - All existing models from both branches
   - Original formatting and spacing

The resulting import includes all profile types from both branches, maintaining full functionality from both sides of the merge.
