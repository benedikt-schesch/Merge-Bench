```python
        return 'tvmaze_id'


@event('plugin.register')
def register_plugin():
    plugin.register(PluginTVMazeLookup, 'tvmaze_lookup', api_ver=3, groups=['series_metainfo'])

```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. **API Version Upgrade:** The incoming change (`api_ver=3`) supersedes the HEAD version (`api_ver=2`), indicating an intentional plugin API upgrade.
2. **Additional Metadata:** The incoming change adds `groups=['series_metainfo']` which provides valuable context about the plugin's purpose without conflicting with existing functionality.
3. **Semantic Compatibility:** The added `groups` parameter is backward-compatible and doesn't alter the core registration behavior, making it safe to include.

The resolution preserves both the API upgrade and enhanced plugin metadata from the incoming change while removing the outdated API version.
