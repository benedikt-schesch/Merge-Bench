The conflict arises from a difference in function signature formatting. The semantics are identical; one version uses a single line while the other splits the signature for readability.

Given both versions achieve the same functionality and there are no semantic differences, the resolution chooses the multi-line format for improved readability. Here's the resolved version:

```python
        return value
    return lambda: value


@contextmanager
def raises(
    exc, msg: typing.Optional[str] = None, regex: typing.Optional[re.Pattern] = None
) -> Generator[None, None, None]:
    try:
        yield
    except exc as e:
        if msg is not None:
            assert str(e) == msg, '%r != %r' % (str(e), msg)

```
