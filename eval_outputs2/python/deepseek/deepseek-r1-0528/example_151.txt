The conflict involves a difference in print syntax and additional exit code logic. The HEAD branch uses Python 3's `print()` function syntax, while the other branch uses Python 2's `print` statement. More critically, the other branch adds exit code logic that would cause the program to exit inside the summary loop - a likely bug since it would terminate after the first iteration rather than processing all summaries.

Since the intent of the exit code logic (proper program termination) conflicts with the loop structure, and we lack context about `tests_pass` variable existence or overall program flow, the conflict cannot be safely resolved automatically. The original conflict is preserved below:

```python
>>>>>>> 99c62cf1a302570fa18cbf8ccb9c451c1bdb58d4
            summary.append(s)

print('\nSummary:')
for s in summary:
<<<<<<< HEAD
    print(s)
=======
    print s
    exit_code = 0 if tests_pass else 1
    sys.exit(exit_code)
>>>>>>> 99c62cf1a302570fa18cbf8ccb9c451c1bdb58d4

```
