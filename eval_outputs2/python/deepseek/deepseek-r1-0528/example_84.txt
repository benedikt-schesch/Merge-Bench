Based on the provided code snippet, I've analyzed the merge conflict:

1. The conflict occurs in the import section and variable declaration
2. Both sides add different imports:
   - HEAD adds needle and nose imports
   - Other branch adds sys import
3. Both branches include `import os` after the conflict markers
4. The second conflict block is incomplete (only shows HEAD version) so it must be preserved as unresolved

Here's the resolved snippet with the first conflict resolved and the second conflict preserved:

```python
import sys
from needle.plugin import NeedleCapturePlugin, SaveBaselinePlugin
from nose.plugins import PluginTester
import os

<<<<<<< HEAD

baseline_filename = 'screenshots/baseline/red_box.png'

```

Resolution rationale:
1. Combined imports from both branches since they're not mutually exclusive
2. Kept standard library imports (`sys`) first, then third-party imports
3. Preserved the common `import os` statement
4. Left the second conflict unresolved due to missing other branch information
5. Maintained original spacing and formatting throughout
