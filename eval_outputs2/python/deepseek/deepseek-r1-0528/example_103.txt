The conflict arises from different approaches to running tests and cleanup. The HEAD branch uses a specific test runner with coverage reporting and directory cleanup, while the other branch uses the simpler `unittest.main()` approach. 

The resolution combines both intents by:
1. Using `unittest.main(exit=False)` to run tests (preserving the other branch's approach)
 coverage coverage reporting and directory cleanup (preserving HEAD functionality)
3. Using `exit=False` allows post-test actions to execute

Here's the resolved code:

```python
    import ivre.utils
    import ivre.mathutils
    import ivre.passive
    if not hasattr(IvreTests, "assertItemsEqual"):
        IvreTests.assertItemsEqual = IvreTests.assertCountEqual
    unittest.main(verbosity=2, exit=False)
    coverage_report()
    ivre.utils.cleandir("bin")
```
