I'll resolve this conflict by analyzing both versions. The conflict is about how to format the `widget` attribute for the disabled form field. Both versions are functionally identical but differ in formatting style.

The key points:
1. Both versions set the `disabled` attribute in the widget
2. The only difference is code formatting (one-line vs multi-line)
3. The surrounding code uses multi-line formatting for complex parameters
4. The multi-line version with trailing comma is more consistent with the project's style

Resolved code:
```python
        help_text=u'This is the standard text input',
    )
    disabled = forms.CharField(
        max_length=100,
        help_text=u'I am read only',
        widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={
            'disabled': 'disabled',
        })
    )
    content = forms.ChoiceField(
        choices=(
            ("text", "Plain text"),
            ("html", "HTML"),
```

I chose the multi-line version because:
1. It matches the multi-line style used in the `content` field below
2. The trailing comma makes future attribute additions cleaner
3. It maintains consistency with Django form declaration best practices
4. Both versions are semantically identical, so we prioritize code style consistency
