```python
            return lambda p, v: self._compiled(p, v)
        elif hasattr(schema, "__voluptuous_compile__"):
            return schema.__voluptuous_compile__(self)
        if isinstance(schema, Object):
            return self._compile_object(schema)
        if isinstance(schema, collections.abc.Mapping):
            return self._compile_dict(schema)
        elif isinstance(schema, list):
            return self._compile_list(schema)
        elif isinstance(schema, tuple):
            return self._compile_tuple(schema)
```

The resolution adopts the standard ABC from `collections.abc` for mapping checks which:
1. Follows Python's best practices for type checking
2. Maintains consistency with Python's collections hierarchy 
3. Provides broader compatibility with mapping-like objects
4. Aligns with common patterns in modern Python code

The change from a private `_Mapping` to the standard library's ABC suggests this was an intentional refactoring to improve type safety and maintainability. Since tests would likely require standard interface implementations rather than internal types, this should maintain existing functionality while improving interoperability.
