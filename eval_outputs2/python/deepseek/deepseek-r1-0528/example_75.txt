Based on the semantic analysis, I'll resolve this conflict by selecting the more readable multi-line version from the >>>>>>> branch. Here's the resolved snippet:

```python
    Special class to use as a parent class for validators using sub-validators.
    This class provides the `__voluptuous_compile__` method so the
    sub-validators are compiled by the parent `Schema`.
    """

    def __init__(
        self, *validators, msg=None, required=False, discriminant=None, **kwargs
    ) -> None:
        self.validators = validators
        self.msg = msg
        self.required = required
        self.discriminant = discriminant


```

### Resolution Explanation:
1. **Preserves identical functionality**: Both versions are semantically equivalent
2. **Improves readability**: The multi-line format better accommodates:
   - Multiple parameters
   - Type hinting (`-> None`)
   - Easier code maintenance
3. **Maintains consistent indentation**: The 4-space indentation matches surrounding code
4. **Resolves conflict without changing behavior**: Same parameters and initialization logic are preserved

The multi-line version has clear advantages for readability while maintaining identical functionality to the single-line version.
