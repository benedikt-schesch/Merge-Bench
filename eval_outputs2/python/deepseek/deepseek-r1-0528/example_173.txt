I've analyzed the merge conflict and resolved it by combining the changes from both branches. The conflict occurs in the import statements section. Here's the resolution:

1. Preserved the Python 2.1 compatibility import from the feature branch
2. Kept the GCD import from the HEAD branch since it's needed for RSA operations
3. Maintained the original spacing and context

```python

__all__ = ['rsa_construct']

import sys

if sys.version_info[0] == 2 and sys.version_info[1] == 1:
    from Crypto.Util.py21compat import *
from Crypto.Util.number import size, inverse, GCD

class error(Exception):
    pass

class _RSAKey(object):
