The conflict involves the `__version__` assignment, where both branches set it to a `.dev` suffix per the context instructions. However, the specific versions (`2.9.0.dev` vs `2.8.25.dev`) differ, and the intent is ambiguous without knowing the correct next release version. Since we cannot determine whether the higher version or the version from the other branch should take precedence, the conflict remains unresolved. 

```python

The version should always be set to the <next release version>.dev
The jenkins release job will automatically strip the .dev for release,
and update the version again for continued development.
