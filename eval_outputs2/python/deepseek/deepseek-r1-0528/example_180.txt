Here's the resolved snippet with the conflict addressed based on semantic intent. Both imports are preserved since they appear to serve different purposes (`get_connection` likely retrieves a connection, while `connections` might manage connection pools or configurations). The combined import maintains functionality from both branches:

```python
from . import analysis
from .connections import get_connection, connections
from .exceptions import IllegalOperation
from .mapping import Mapping
from .search import Search
from .update_by_query import UpdateByQuery
from .utils import merge

```

**Resolution rationale:**  
- Both `get_connection` and `connections` are likely needed components  
- Importing both names maintains compatibility with changes from both branches  
- Single-line import is consistent with surrounding code style  
- No context suggests these are mutually exclusive  
- Spacing and surrounding context are preserved exactly as provided
