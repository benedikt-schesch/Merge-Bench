```python
    # print a debug.dbg title
    debug.dbg()
    debug.dbg('-' * 70)
    debug.dbg(' ' * 62 + 'complete')
    debug.dbg('-' * 70)
    debug.dbg('complete_scope', scope)
    debug.dbg('user_scope', f.parser.user_scope.get_simple_for_line(row))

    try:
        path = f.get_row_path(column)
    except ParserError as e:
        path = []
```

Resolution reasoning:
1. Both sides share the common goal of logging debug information
2. The surrounding context consistently uses `debug.dbg()` for debug output
3. The conflicting changes are complementary rather than mutually exclusive:
   - HEAD logs `complete_scope` using the existing debug framework
   - The other branch adds new logging for `user_scope`
4. To maintain consistency and preserve both intents:
   - Keep `debug.dbg` format for `complete_scope` (HEAD version)
   - Convert the `print` statement for `user_scope` to match `debug.dbg` style
   - Add the `user_scope` logging as a new line
5. The `row` variable from the other branch's change appears to be in scope based on the surrounding context

This resolution maintains:
- Consistent debug logging style
- All debug information from both branches
- Semantic meaning of both changes
- Proper indentation and formatting
