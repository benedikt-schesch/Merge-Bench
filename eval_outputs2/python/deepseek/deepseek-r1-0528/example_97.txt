I'll help you resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intent of both changes. Here's the resolution:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# coding: utf8

from __future__ import absolute_import
from geocoder.base import OneResult, MultipleResultsQuery
from geocoder.keys import mapquest_key
from geocoder.mapquest import MapquestResult, MapquestQuery


class MapQuestBatchResult(MapquestResult):


```

### Explanation:
1. **Intent Analysis**:
   - The HEAD version only keeps the essential imports for Mapquest functionality
   - The incoming branch adds imports for base classes (`OneResult`, `MultipleResultsQuery`) and API key handling (`mapquest_key`)
   - These additional imports are likely required for the new `MapQuestBatchResult` class to function properly

2. **Resolution Logic**:
   - The base class imports are necessary for class inheritance patterns
   - The API key import suggests authentication requirements
   - Keeping all imports satisfies both requirements without conflict
   - No functionality is removed from either branch

3. **Why this works**:
   - Preserves HEAD's Mapquest functionality
   - Incorporates incoming branch's requirements for batch processing
   - Maintains backward compatibility
   - Avoids redundant imports (no duplicates exist)

The resolution maintains all required dependencies while ensuring the new class has necessary components to function.
