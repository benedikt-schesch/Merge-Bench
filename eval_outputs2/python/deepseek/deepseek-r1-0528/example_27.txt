Based on the conflict, the key difference is formatting style for the method signature while maintaining identical semantics. Here's the resolution:

```python
        REMOVE_EXTRA: 'REMOVE_EXTRA',
        ALLOW_EXTRA: 'ALLOW_EXTRA',
        PREVENT_EXTRA: 'PREVENT_EXTRA',
    }

    def __init__(
        self, schema: Schemable, required: bool = False, extra: int = PREVENT_EXTRA
    ) -> None:
        """Create a new Schema.

        :param schema: Validation schema. See :module:`voluptuous` for details.
        :param required: Keys defined in the schema must be in the data.
        :param extra: Specify how extra keys in the data are treated:
```

**Resolution rationale:**  
1. Both versions share identical parameters and functionality  
2. The multi-line formatting improves readability and complies with PEP-8 line limits  
3. The branch version's formatting is preserved since it:  
   - Maintains alignment with common Python conventions  
   - Retains vertical space efficiency while clearly showing parameters  
   - Prevents overlong lines (~98 chars vs PEP-8's 79 char guideline)  

The surrounding context remains unchanged as per requirements.
