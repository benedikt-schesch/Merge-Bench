I'll resolve this merge conflict by selecting the more conventional docstring formatting. The conflict is about the docstring whitespace, which is a minor style difference. The branch version without extra spaces aligns better with PEP 257 conventions.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```python
    schema = Schema({'a': {Extra: object}}, required=True)
    schema({'a': {}})


def test_literal():
    """Test with Literal"""

    schema = Schema([Literal({"a": 1}), Literal({"b": 1})])
    schema([{"a": 1}])
    schema([{"b": 1}])
    schema([{"a": 1}, {"b": 1}])
```

Key resolution points:
1. Kept the docstring from the branch version (`"""Test with Literal"""`) as it follows PEP 257 conventions
2. Removed merge conflict markers while preserving all other formatting
3. Maintained identical functionality and context
4. The resolution is unambiguous as it's purely a style preference with no semantic impact

The rest of the code remains unchanged as it was identical in both branches.
