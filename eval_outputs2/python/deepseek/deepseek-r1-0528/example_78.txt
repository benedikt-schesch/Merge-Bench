The merge conflict has been resolved by selecting the version from the branch `1fcf849f16279d43010c89c5d8cf69d5de96a800` since it provides equivalent functionality with more compact formatting. The chosen version maintains the same logical behavior while improving readability with consistent single-line statements.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```python
            except Invalid as e:
                if error is None or len(e.path) > len(error.path):
                    error = e
        else:
            if error:
                raise error if self.msg is None else AnyInvalid(self.msg, path=path)
            raise AnyInvalid(self.msg or 'no valid value found', path=path)

# Convenience alias
Switch = Union
