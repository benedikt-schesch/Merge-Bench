The conflict arises from a difference in formatting style for a list comprehension. Both versions produce identical results, but the HEAD version uses a multi-line format while the other branch uses a single-line format. The single-line version is more concise and maintains consistency with the surrounding context's coding style (as seen in the subsequent `working` method). 

Here's the resolved snippet:

```python
        if isinstance(host,basestring):
            resq = ResQ(host)
        elif isinstance(host, ResQ):
            resq = host

        return [Worker.find(w,resq) for w in resq.redis.smembers('resque:workers') or []]

    @classmethod
    def working(cls, host):
        if isinstance(host, basestring):
            resq = ResQ(host)
```

Key resolution points:
1. Both versions are semantically equivalent
2. The single-line format aligns better with the compact style of the surrounding methods
3. No functionality is changed - only formatting is normalized
4. The resolution maintains Python syntax validity and preserves all original logic
