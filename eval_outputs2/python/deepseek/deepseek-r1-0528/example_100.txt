I've analyzed the semantic merge conflict and resolved it by preserving the necessary compatibility code while removing unnecessary duplication. The original context had two identical `try-except` blocks for Python 2/3 compatibility, but one was redundant. Here's the resolved version:

```python

try:
    range = xrange
except NameError:
    pass


def guess_prefix(directory=None):
    """Attempts to find the base directory where IVRE components are
    installed.
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. Both sides try to provide Python 2/3 compatibility by aliasing `xrange` to `range`
2. The duplicate block in the HEAD was redundant as it contained identical code to the existing block above the conflict
3. The other branch correctly removed this duplication 
4. The solution keeps one copy of the compatibility code for semantic correctness while maintaining intended functionality
5. Blank lines are preserved exactly as in the original surrounding context

The resolution maintains the original functionality while removing unnecessary code duplication that might cause confusion or maintenance issues.
