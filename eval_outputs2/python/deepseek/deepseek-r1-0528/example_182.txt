I'll analyze the conflict and provide the resolved code while preserving the surrounding context exactly as given.

```python
from . import analysis
<<<<<<< HEAD
from .connections import get_connection
=======
from .connections import connections
>>>>>>> 2b6358206668e2d1a8604e93e63267b4ee737225
from .exceptions import IllegalOperation
from .mapping import Mapping
from .search import Search
from .update_by_query import UpdateByQuery
from .utils import merge

```

**Reasoning for unresolved conflict:**
1. The conflict shows two different imports from the same module:
   - HEAD imports `get_connection` (likely a function)
   - The other branch imports `connections` (could be a module or different object)

2. Semantic ambiguity exists because:
   - Both imports appear to serve different purposes
   - The surrounding context doesn't reveal how they're used
   - Without knowing the implementation details, we can't determine if:
     * `connections` replaces `get_connection`
     * Both are needed
     * They serve the same purpose through different interfaces

3. Since the intent is ambiguous and we lack usage context, this conflict requires human decision to:
   - Determine if both imports are needed
   - Verify if one was renamed/replaced by the other
   - Check for usage in other parts of the file

The safest approach is to preserve the conflict markers for manual resolution.
