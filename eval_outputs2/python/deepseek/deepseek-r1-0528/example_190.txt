I've analyzed the provided code snippet with the merge conflict. The conflict arises from two different approaches to handling multi-line string processing:

1. The HEAD branch (current branch) focuses on conditional logic for processing lines as code
2. The other branch (bbeee06) focuses on cleaning delimiter characters from lines before adding to documentation

After careful consideration of the semantics, I find the intent ambiguous because:
- The HEAD branch's condition might be necessary for correct state management
- The other branch's delimiter removal is important for clean documentation output
- It's unclear if these operations are mutually exclusive or need to be combined
- The different approaches to indentation and control flow make reconciliation non-trivial

Since I can't determine the exact semantic requirements, I'm returning the original conflicted snippet:

```python
            if (multi_line
                    and line.strip().endswith(multiend)
                    and len(line.strip()) > len(multiend)):
                multi_line = False

<<<<<<< HEAD
            if((not line.strip().startswith(multistart) and not multi_line) or multi_string):
=======
            # Get rid of the delimiters so that they aren't in the final docs
            line = line.replace(multistart, '')
            line = line.replace(multiend, '')
            docs_text += line.strip() + '\n'
            indent_level = re.match("\s*", line).group(0)

                process_as_code = True

                if(multi_string):
                    multi_line = False
