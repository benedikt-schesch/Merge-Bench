I'll resolve this merge conflict by selecting the more general type annotation that satisfies both branches while preserving the method's intent:

```python
        self.errors.append(error)

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return str(self.errors[0])

    def prepend(self, path: typing.List[typing.Hashable]) -> None:
        for error in self.errors:
            error.prepend(path)


class RequiredFieldInvalid(Invalid):
```

**Resolution Notes:**  
1. Both branches modify the `path` parameter's type annotation
2. `Hashable` is more general than `str` (supports strings & other hashable types)
3. Since strings are hashable, this satisfies both branches' requirements
4. Maintains flexibility while preserving functionality
5. Keeps surrounding context unchanged as requested

The conflict is resolved by choosing the broader type annotation (`typing.Hashable`) that allows all hashable types including strings, ensuring both branches' modifications are respected without breaking existing functionality.
