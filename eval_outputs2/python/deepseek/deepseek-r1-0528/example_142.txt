```python
"""Auto-generated file, do not edit by hand. 62 metadata"""
from ..phonemetadata import NumberFormat

PHONE_ALT_FORMAT_62 = [NumberFormat(pattern='(\\d{2})(\\d{3,4})(\\d{4})', format='\\1 \\2', leading_digits_pattern=['2[124]|[36]1'])]

```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. **Pattern Flexibility:** The branch version `(\\d{3,4})` is more flexible as it supports both 3 and 4-digit groupings for the middle segment, while HEAD's `(\\d{4})` is overly restrictive.
2. **Unicode Handling:** The `u` prefix in `u'\\1 \\2'` is redundant in Python 3 where all strings are Unicode by default.
3. **Semantic Alignment:** Both branches agree on:
   - Format string (`\\1 \\2`)
   - Leading digits pattern (`['2[124]|[36]1']`)
   - Capturing 2-digit prefix + variable middle segment + 4-digit suffix
4. **Metadata Compatibility:** The resolved pattern aligns with international phone number formatting standards where certain regions have variable-length area codes.

The resolution maintains intended functionality while incorporating both branches' improvements.
