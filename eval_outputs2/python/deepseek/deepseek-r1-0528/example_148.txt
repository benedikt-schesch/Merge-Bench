The conflict involves two key changes:
1. Different build script names: HEAD adds "buildgeocodingdata.py" while the other branch adds "buildprefixdata.py"
2. Different print syntax: HEAD uses a function call (potentially Python 3 syntax) while the other branch uses Python 2 print syntax

The intent appears to be:
- Handle cases when running either of several build scripts
- Print a warning about autogeneration
- Skip loading data during custom build processes

Since there's ambiguity about:
1. Which build scripts should be included - both "buildgeocodingdata.py" and "buildprefixdata.py" seem necessary but we don't know if both are valid
2. Which print style is appropriate for the codebase
3. Whether `prnt` in HEAD is intentional or a typo

Here's the output with conflict preserved:

```python
    # The generation process imports this module, creating a circular
    # dependency.  The hack below works around this.
    import os
    import sys
    if (os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildmetadatafromxml.py" or
<<<<<<< HEAD
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildgeocodingdata.py"):
        prnt("Failed to import generated data (but OK as during autogeneration)", file=sys.stderr)
=======
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildprefixdata.py"):
        print >> sys.stderr, "Failed to import generated data (but OK as during autogeneration)"
>>>>>>> 298c8f361a29b79085d5f926a70e863e056a33a5
        _ALT_NUMBER_FORMATS = {}
    else:
        raise

```

Resolution requires knowing:
- If both builds scripts should be supported
- The correct print syntax for this file
- Whether `prnt` is intentional or should be `print`
- Python version compatibility requirements

Without this context, the conflict cannot be safely resolved programmatically. Manual intervention is needed to determine correct behavior.
