The merge conflict arises from two independent changes: one adding a logger and another adding two configuration settings. Both changes are compatible and should be included. The logger from the HEAD branch is placed first since it's a foundational utility, followed by the new configuration settings from the other branch. The blank lines are preserved to maintain readability.

Resolved code:
```python
    'socialregistration.forms.UserForm')

INITAL_DATA_FUNCTION = getattr(settings, 'SOCIALREGISTRATION_INITIAL_DATA_FUNCTION',
    None)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

CONTEXT_FUNCTION = getattr(settings, 'SOCIALREGISTRATION_SETUP_CONTEXT_FUNCTION',
    None)

ALLOW_OPENID_SIGNUPS = getattr(settings, 'SOCIALREGISTRATION_ALLOW_OPENID_SIGNUPS',
    True)


class Setup(SocialRegistration, View):
    """
    Setup view to create new Django users from third party APIs.
    """
```
