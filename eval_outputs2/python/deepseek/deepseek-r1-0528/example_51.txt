Resolved by selecting the more concise and PEP 8 compliant docstring format from the branch.

```python
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise Invalid for String"


def test_number_validation_with_valid_precision_scale_yield_decimal_false():
    """Test with Number with valid precision, scale and no yield_decimal"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(precision=6, scale=2, yield_decimal=False)})
    out_ = schema({"number": '1234.00'})
    assert out_.get("number") == '1234.00'



```

Explanation:
1. Kept context above (`else: assert...`) and below (schema/assert implementations) unchanged
2. Resolved conflict by choosing the branch version (`1fcf...`) of the docstring which:
   - Removes the extra space after opening triple quotes
   - Matches common Python docstring style guidelines (PEP 257)
3. Preserved all whitespace and newlines exactly as in original non-conflict areas
4. Maintained semantic intent - both versions describe exactly the same test purpose
5. Conflict resolution is unambiguous as only whitespace styling differs
