The conflict is trivial, with both sides implementing identical logic for the `m1` calculation. The only difference is a trailing space in one version which has no semantic impact. I've resolved by keeping the cleaner version without the trailing space.

```python
    def _decrypt(self, c):
        # compute c**d (mod n)
        if not self.has_private():
            raise TypeError("No private key")
        if (hasattr(self,'p') and hasattr(self,'q') and hasattr(self,'u')):
            m1 = pow(c, self.d % (self.p-1), self.p)
            m2 = pow(c, self.d % (self.q-1), self.q)
            h = m2 - m1
            if (h<0):
                h = h + self.q
            h = h*self.u % self.q
```
