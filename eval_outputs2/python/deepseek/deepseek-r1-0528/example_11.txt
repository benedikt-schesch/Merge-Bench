I've analyzed the merge conflict and resolved it based on the semantic intent of both branches. The conflict involves the version string assignment, where HEAD uses "13.1" and the other branch uses "13.0.1". 

The resolution keeps "13.1" because:
1. The comment states that after tagging a release, we should increment the tag
2. "13.1" represents a higher version than "13.0.1" (semantic versioning)
3. The HEAD version likely represents the mainline development progress
4. The patch version "13.0.1" would be inappropriate for the main development branch

Here's the resolved code:

```python
# When tagging a release, set `released = True`.
# After tagging a release, set `released = False` and increment `tag`.

released = False

tag = version = commit = "13.1"

if not released:  # pragma: no cover
    import pathlib
    import re

```
