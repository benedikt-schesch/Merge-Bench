Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved since the intent is ambiguous:

```python
    # The generation process imports this module, creating a circular
    # dependency.  The hack below works around this.
    import os
    import sys
    if (os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildmetadatafromxml.py" or
<<<<<<< HEAD
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildgeocodingdata.py"):
        prnt("Failed to import generated data (but OK as during autogeneration)", file=sys.stderr)
=======
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildprefixdata.py"):
        print >> sys.stderr, "Failed to import generated data (but OK as during autogeneration)"
>>>>>>> 298c8f361a29b79085d5f926a70e863e056a33a5
        _COUNTRY_CODE_TO_REGION_CODE = {1: ("US",)}
        _AVAILABLE_SHORT_REGION_CODES = []
    else:
        raise
```

### Explanation:
- **Ambiguous Intent**: The conflict involves both a script name check (`buildgeocodingdata.py` vs `buildprefixdata.py`) and different print implementations (`prnt` with Python 3 syntax vs `print` with Python 2 syntax). 
- **Semantic Uncertainty**: Merging both script names might be safe, but the print statements have compatibility implications (Python 2 vs Python 3) and `prnt` could be a typo/custom function. 
- **Risk of Error**: Changing the print behavior could break the script during autogeneration when the module is used in different contexts.
- **Preservation Rule**: When intent is unclear, the conflict is left untouched for human resolution.
