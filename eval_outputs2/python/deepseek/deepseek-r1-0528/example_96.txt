The conflict occurs in the comment header at the top of the file. Both sides are trying to maintain a consistent comment block structure for the jVectorMap version information. 

The resolution keeps the cleaner header format without the extra blank comment line (`#`). This maintains:
1. The version information immediately at the top
2. Standard comment spacing
3. Copyright information
4. Semantic consistency with typical header conventions

Here's the resolved code:

```python
# jVectorMap version 2.0.4
#
# Copyright 2011-2013, Kirill Lebedev
#


```
