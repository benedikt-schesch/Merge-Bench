The conflict arises from differing version numbers and formatting styles. The HEAD branch specifies `version = '3.98'` with spaces around the equals sign, while the other branch uses `version='3.97'` without spaces. 

After semantic analysis:
1. The version number should be `3.98` (the higher version from HEAD)
2. The formatting should match the surrounding consistent style (no spaces around `=` as seen in other parameters)

Resolved version maintains HEAD's version number while adopting the formatting style from the other branch for consistency.
