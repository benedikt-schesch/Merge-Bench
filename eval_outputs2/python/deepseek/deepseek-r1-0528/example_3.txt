The merge conflict centers around setting the background color of a `wx.Panel`. After analyzing both changes:

1. **HEAD branch** sets `parent.SetBackgroundColour(wx.WHITE)` and includes an extra line
2. **Other branch** removes the background color setting and has minimal whitespace

The background color setting appears to be a deliberate UI styling choice. Since removing it could cause visual inconsistencies and there's no indication it conflicts with other functionality, I recommend keeping the styling change. The resolution maintains the background color while preserving consistent spacing:

```python
            modificationManager.refresh()

        # Create filelist
        if len(self.torrent.files) > 0:
            parent = wx.Panel(self.notebook)
            parent.SetBackgroundColour(wx.WHITE)

            self.listCtrl = SelectableListCtrl(parent)
            self.listCtrl.InsertColumn(0, 'Name')
            self.listCtrl.InsertColumn(1, 'Size', wx.LIST_FORMAT_RIGHT)

            if isinstance(self, LibraryDetails):
```

Key resolution points:
1. Kept `parent.SetBackgroundColour(wx.WHITE)` for consistent UI styling
2. Maintained single empty line after the color setting (balancing both versions' spacing)
3. Preserved all surrounding context unchanged
4. The change is semantically safe as it only affects visual presentation
