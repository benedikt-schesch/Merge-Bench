```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

version='0.9.1'
setup(
    name='pyres',
    version=version,
    description='Python resque clone',
    author='Matt George',
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
The conflict occurs between two version specifications: `0.9` (HEAD) and `0.9.1` (incoming branch). Since version `0.9.1` semantically represents a patch-level increment over `0.9`, it likely includes bug fixes or minor improvements while retaining the same core functionality. Merging the higher patch version (`0.9.1`) preserves improvements from both branches without introducing breaking changes. The context remains unmodified as requested.
