To resolve this merge conflict, we need to consider both branches' changes while maintaining consistency with the surrounding context. The conflict arises around the `_COLOMBIA_MOBILE_TO_FIXED_LINE_PREFIX` assignment and an additional dictionary definition in one branch.

Key observations:
1. The HEAD branch uses `unicod("3")` (likely a typo) while the other branch uses `"3"`.
2. The other branch adds a new mapping dictionary `_MOBILE_TOKEN_MAPPINGS`.
3. All other string constants in the file use `u(...)` for unicode strings.
4. The typo `unicod` should be corrected to `u` for consistency with existing code.

Resolution reasoning:
- Both assignments should be preserved
- The typo in `unicod` must be fixed to match the established pattern (`u`)
- The new dictionary from the other branch should be included
- No changes to surrounding context needed

Resolved code:
```python
UNKNOWN_REGION = u("ZZ")
# The set of regions that share country calling code 1.
_NANPA_COUNTRY_CODE = 1
# The prefix that needs to be inserted in front of a Colombian landline number
# when dialed from a mobile phone in Colombia.
_COLOMBIA_MOBILE_TO_FIXED_LINE_PREFIX = u("3")
# Map of country calling codes that use a mobile token before the area
# code. One example of when this is relevant is when determining the length of
# the national destination code, which should be the length of the area code
# plus the length of the mobile token.
_MOBILE_TOKEN_MAPPINGS = {52: u'1', 54: u'9'}
# The PLUS_SIGN signifies the international prefix.
_PLUS_SIGN = u("+")
_STAR_SIGN = u('*')
_RFC3966_EXTN_PREFIX = u(";ext=")
_RFC3966_PREFIX = u("tel:")
