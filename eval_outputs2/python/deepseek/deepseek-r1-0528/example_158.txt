The version conflict can be resolved by analyzing the version numbers and their context. Both changes are trying to set the version constant, but:

1. `0.6.0-alpha` appears to be a newer (pre-release) version
2. `0.5.4` is an older stable version
3. The presence of `-alpha` indicates the HEAD version is part of active development
4. The comment references setup.py confirmation suggests both developers intended to maintain consistent version declarations

Since we're merging into the HEAD branch which contains new changes, we should keep its newer development version. The resolved code snippet is:

```python

from pystache.init import parse, render, Renderer, TemplateSpec

__all__ = ['parse', 'render', 'Renderer', 'TemplateSpec']

__version__ = '0.6.0-alpha'  # Also change in setup.py.

```
