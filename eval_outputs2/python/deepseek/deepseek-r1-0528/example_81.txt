Based on the semantic analysis of both changes:
1. Both changes are updating the version number in the setup configuration
2. The HEAD version (0.15.0) and branch version (0.16.0) represent different version increments
3. This conflict requires human judgment to determine the correct version number
4. The version number should reflect the combined state of both changes

Since we can't determine the correct version automatically, I'm returning the unresolved conflict:

```python
    # TODO: put package test requirements here
]

setup(
    name='python-nvd3',
<<<<<<< HEAD
    version='0.15.0',
=======
    version='0.16.0',
