After analyzing the semantic intent of both sides of the merge conflict, I've determined both versions are functionally identical. The only difference is minor whitespace formatting in the docstring - a single space after the opening triple quotes. Since the version in the branch commit is more consistent with PEP 8 style guidelines (avoiding unnecessary whitespace) and both URLs will resolve identically, I'll resolve using the second version.

Resolved code:
```python
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise correct Invalid"


def test_schema_empty_dict_key():
    """https://github.com/alecthomas/voluptuous/pull/434"""
    s = Schema({'var': []})
    s({'var': []})

    try:
        s({'var': [123]})

```
