I'll resolve this conflict by analyzing the intent of both changes while preserving the surrounding context. Here's the resolution:

```python
@task
def install_proxy():
    """
    Install Cozy Proxy
    """
    sudo('cozy-monitor install proxy')
    print(green("Proxy successfully installed"))

@task
def install_apps():
    """
    Install Cozy Notes and Cozy Todos
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. The function's name and docstring (`install_proxy()` and "Install Cozy Proxy") clearly indicate its purpose is to install a proxy
2. The HEAD version's code directly matches this intent by:
   - Running the proxy installation command (`sudo('cozy-monitor install proxy')`)
   - Printing a success message about proxy installation
3. The other branch's code appears unrelated as it:
   - Updates supervisor config (which might be part of a different setup process)
   - Prints a message about Redis uninstallation (completely unrelated to proxy installation)
4. Since the conflicting code doesn't align with the function's stated purpose, I've kept only the HEAD version that matches the function's intent

The surrounding context remains completely unchanged as requested, with only the conflict markers removed and the appropriate code path selected.
