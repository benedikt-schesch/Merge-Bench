The conflict involves a minor difference in the docstring spacing. Both sides are functionally equivalent - the only difference is a space after the opening triple quotes in the HEAD branch. Since this doesn't affect functionality and the branch version maintains consistent spacing with other docstrings in the file, we choose the branch version.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
    out_ = schema({"number": '12345678901234'})
    assert out_.get("number") == 12345678901234


def test_number_when_precision_none_n_valid_scale_case1_yield_decimal_true():
    """Test with Number with no precision and valid scale case 1"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(scale=2, yield_decimal=True)})
    out_ = schema({"number": '123456789.34'})
    assert float(out_.get("number")) == 123456789.34



```
