Based on resolving the semantic intent of both branches, here is the merged code:

```python
            query.set_timeframe(options.after, options.before)
        if options.no_patents:
            query.set_include_patents(False)
        if options.no_citations:
            query.set_include_citations(False)
        if options.start:
            query.set_start_index(options.start)
        if options.date:
            query.set_sort_by_date(True)

    if options.count is not None:
        options.count = min(options.count, ScholarConf.MAX_PAGE_RESULTS)
        query.set_num_page_results(options.count)
```

Justification:
1. Preserved original control flow structure
2. Both conditions are independent operations:
   - `HEAD` adds pagination support via `start`
   - Other branch adds date-sorting via `date` option
3. Added both options sequentially as they don't conflict
4. Maintained same indentation and surrounding code
5. The operations are semantically distinct and can coexist

The resolution adds both features since:
- `set_start_index()` handles pagination offset
- `set_sort_by_date()` changes result ordering
- These are complementary concerns in a query builder
