Based on the provided code snippet, the conflict occurs solely in the docstring formatting. Both versions convey the same semantic meaning, differing only in the presence of a leading space in the opening triple quotes. The surrounding code context remains identical in both branches.

Here's the resolved version following Python docstring conventions (PEP 257) which recommend no space after opening quotes:

```python
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise Invalid for String"


def test_number_when_valid_precision_n_scale_none_yield_decimal_true():
    """Test with Number with no precision and valid scale"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(precision=14, yield_decimal=True)})
    out_ = schema({"number": '1234567.8901234'})
    assert float(out_.get("number")) == 1234567.8901234



```

Key resolution reasoning:
1. Removed conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
2. Kept the branch version's docstring formatting (without leading space) as it aligns with PEP 257 conventions
3. Preserved all surrounding context and spacing exactly as provided
4. Maintained identical code functionality since both branches implement the same test logic

The change is purely stylistic and doesn't affect the test's behavior or semantics.
