Based on the semantic analysis of both branches' changes, here's the resolved version that preserves both functionalities:

```python

import unittest

from phonenumbers import PhoneNumber, FrozenPhoneNumber
from phonenumbers import geocoder
from phonenumbers.geocoder import description_for_number, country_name_for_number
from phonenumbers.geocoder import description_for_valid_number
from phonenumbers.geocoder import _area_description_for_number
from phonenumbers.prefix import prefix_description_for_number
from phonenumbers.util import u

# Allow override library geocoding metadata with the test metadata.
REAL_GEOCODE_DATA = geocoder.GEOCODE_DATA
REAL_GEOCODE_LONGEST_PREFIX = geocoder.GEOCODE_LONGEST_PREFIX
from .testgeodata import GEOCODE_DATA as TEST_GEOCODE_DATA

```

### Resolution Summary:
1. **Combined Imports**: 
   - Added both HEAD's `_area_description_for_number` and other branch's `prefix_description_for_number` since they serve different purposes
   - Unified import paths for description/country functions under `phonenumbers.geocoder`
   - Preserved HEAD's `from phonenumbers.util import u`

2. **Justification**:
   - The geocoder-specific imports are semantically consistent
   - The prefix utilities are additive functionality
   - The test setup (`REAL_GEOCODE_*` assignments) remains unaffected
   - Original spacing and comment context preserved

Both branches' semantic intents are maintained with no conflicting modifications. The original imports from both contexts are included while avoiding duplication.
