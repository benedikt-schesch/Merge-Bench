I'll resolve the merge conflict by preserving both intents while choosing the most readable format. Here's the resolved snippet:

```python
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(precision=6, scale=2)})
    try:
        schema({"number": 'teststr'})
    except MultipleInvalid as e:
        assert (
            str(e)
            == "Value must be a number enclosed with string for dictionary value @ data['number']"
        )
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise Invalid for String"


def test_number_validation_with_invalid_precision_invalid_scale():
```

### Resolution Explanation:
1. **Preserved Semantics**: Both versions of the code have identical functionality and error message
2. **Improved Readability**: I chose the multi-line format from the second commit as it improves readability for longer strings
3. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintained consistent indentation and spacing from the original context
4. **Conflict Markers Removed**: Removed the `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` conflict markers while keeping the valid code

The resolution maintains the exact same assertion logic while using the more readable multi-line string format from the second commit.
