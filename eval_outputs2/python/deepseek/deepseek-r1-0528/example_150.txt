I'll resolve the merge conflict while preserving the intent of both branches. The conflict occurs in the test reporting logic, where one branch adds a test pass/fail tracking mechanism while the other maintains simpler printing.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```python
        if f_name.endswith(".py"):
            path = os.path.join(completion_test_dir, f_name)
            f = open(path)
            num_tests, fails = completion_test(f.read())
            s = 'run %s tests with %s fails (%s)' % (num_tests, fails, f_name)
            if fails:
                tests_pass = False
            print(s)
            summary.append(s)

print('\nSummary:')
for s in summary:
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

Key changes made:
1. Kept the test failure tracking from the feature branch (`if fails: tests_pass = False`)
2. Used the HEAD branch's Python 3 print syntax (`print(s)`)
3. Maintained the `summary.append(s)` call that was common to both branches
4. Preserved the unresolved conflict marker for the summary section since its context is incomplete

The resolution:
- Combines both branches' functionality: tracks test pass/fail status while using modern print syntax
- Preserves all original spacing and context exactly as provided
- Leaves the second conflict marker intact since we don't have enough context to resolve it
