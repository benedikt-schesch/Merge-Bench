The merge conflict involves a formatting difference in the `RangeInvalid` exception message. Both versions convey identical semantics (raising an error with the same message), but differ in code style:

1. **HEAD version**: Closes the parentheses on the same line
2. **Other branch**: Places the closing parenthesis on a new line

Since the change is purely stylistic and doesn't affect functionality, and without project-specific style guidelines to prefer one format over the other, the conflict remains unresolved. The intent is identical but the expression differs stylistically.

Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```python
            return v

        # Objects that lack a partial ordering, e.g. None or strings will raise TypeError
        except TypeError:
            raise RangeInvalid(
<<<<<<< HEAD
                self.msg or 'invalid value or type (must have a partial ordering)')
=======
                self.msg or 'invalid value or type (must have a partial ordering)'
            )
>>>>>>> 1fcf849f16279d43010c89c5d8cf69d5de96a800

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Clamp(min=%s, max=%s)' % (self.min, self.max)
