I've analyzed the merge conflict and resolved it by combining the imports from both branches. The key changes are:

1. Added `AsYouTypeFormatter` from the feature branch (438dd5c) to the first import line
2. Kept the `prnt` import from the main branch (HEAD) as a separate import
3. Preserved all other context exactly as provided

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```python
import re
import unittest

from phonenumbers import PhoneNumberType, PhoneMetadata, NumberParseException
from phonenumbers import phonenumberutil, PhoneNumber, is_emergency_number
from phonenumbers import shortnumberinfo, ShortNumberCost, AsYouTypeFormatter
from phonenumbers.util import prnt
from phonenumbers.re_util import fullmatch


class ExampleNumbersTest(unittest.TestCase):
    """Verifies all of the example numbers in the metadata are valid and of
```

This resolution:
- Maintains both new imports (`AsYouTypeFormatter` and `prnt`)
- Keeps the logical grouping of imports
- Preserves all surrounding context and spacing
- Avoids any ambiguous changes since both imports serve different purposes
- Follows standard Python import conventions
