I'll resolve this merge conflict by combining both changes. The HEAD version adds a necessary layout call after adding UI elements, while the other branch improves code readability with better spacing around bitwise operators. Here's the resolved snippet:

```python

    def AddPage(self, page, text, select=False):
        label = LinkStaticText(self.hSizer_panel, text, None, font_colour=wx.BLACK)
        label.Bind(wx.EVT_LEFT_UP, self.OnLeftUp)
        sline = wx.StaticLine(self.hSizer_panel, -1, style=wx.LI_VERTICAL)
        self.hSizer_labels.Add(label, 0, wx.RIGHT | wx.LEFT | wx.CENTER, self.lspace)
        self.hSizer_labels.Add(sline, 0, wx.EXPAND | wx.ALL | wx.CENTER | wx.TOP | wx.BOTTOM, 5)
        self.hSizer_labels.Layout()
        page.Show(False)
        index = len(self.hSizer_panels.GetChildren()) - 1 if self.ad else len(self.hSizer_panels.GetChildren())
        self.hSizer_panels.Insert(index, page, 100, wx.EXPAND)
        self.labels.append(label)
        self.panels.append(page)

```

Key resolution decisions:
1. Kept the improved spacing from the other branch (`|` operators) for better readability
2. Preserved the critical `self.hSizer_labels.Layout()` call from HEAD which ensures proper UI rendering
3. Maintained all surrounding context unchanged
4. The combination maintains both functional correctness (layout call) and code quality (spacing)

The resolved version ensures:
- UI elements are properly laid out immediately after addition
- Code remains readable with consistent spacing
- All original functionality is preserved
- No ambiguous changes were made to surrounding context
