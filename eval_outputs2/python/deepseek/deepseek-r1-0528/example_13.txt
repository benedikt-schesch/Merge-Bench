```python
        subprocess.run([i, os.path.join(this_dir, "libmagic_test.py")], env=new_env, check=True)

    if not found:
        sys.exit("No versions found: " + str(versions))

    run_test(["python2", "python2.7"])
    run_test(["python3.5", "python3.6", "python3.7", "python3.8", "python3.9"])

```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
The conflict occurs between two different sets of Python versions to test. The semantic intent is to:
1. Preserve Python 2.x testing from the incoming branch
2. Include both the existing Python 3.5-3.8 tests from HEAD
3. Add Python 3.9 support from the incoming branch

The resolution combines both intentions by:
- Keeping the `python2`/`python2.7` test from the incoming branch
- Creating a new line for Python 3 versions that includes both existing (3.5-3.8) and new (3.9) versions
- Maintaining the original function call structure
- Removing conflict markers while preserving all required version tests

This ensures compatibility testing across both Python 2.x and 3.x versions as intended by both branches.
