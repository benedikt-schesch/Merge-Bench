Based on the semantic analysis of the conflicting changes, here's the resolved version of the code snippet. The conflict arises around handling `list` and `dict` types. After examining the semantics:

1. The context shows specialized handlers exist for different types (`_compile_set` for sets)
2. The `_compile_mapping` method following the conflict suggests dictionaries are handled separately 
3. Processing `list`/`dict` as scalars contradicts type-specific handling patterns
4. The removal of `list` and `dict` from the scalar branch aligns better with overall design

Resolution: Accept the change that excludes `list` and `dict` from scalar types

```python
        elif isinstance(schema, (frozenset, set)):
            return self._compile_set(schema)
        type_ = type(schema)
        if inspect.isclass(schema):
            type_ = schema
        if type_ in (*primitive_types, object, type(None)) or callable(schema):
            return _compile_scalar(schema)
        raise er.SchemaError('unsupported schema data type %r' % type(schema).__name__)

    def _compile_mapping(self, schema, invalid_msg=None):
        """Create validator for given mapping."""
