I've analyzed the semantic merge conflict in the import statements. The conflict involves both sides adding different imports. Here's the resolution:

```python
from distutils import core
from distutils.ccompiler import new_compiler
from distutils.core import Extension, Command
from distutils.command.build import build
from distutils.command.build_ext import build_ext
import distutils
import tempfile
import os, sys, re
import struct

if sys.version[0:1] == '1':
    raise RuntimeError ("The Python Cryptography Toolkit requires "
                         "Python 2.x or 3.x to build.")
```

Key resolution points:
1. Preserved both `distutils` and `tempfile` imports from HEAD
2. Added `re` import from the other branch while keeping `os` and `sys`
3. Maintained existing code structure and spacing
4. Kept the `struct` import which wasn't part of the conflict

The resolution combines the semantic intent from both branches:
- The HEAD branch requires `distutils` and `tempfile`
- The other branch requires the `re` module
- Both need `os` and `sys` imports

No ambiguity exists since these are additive imports that don't conflict semantically. The combined imports satisfy requirements from both branches.
