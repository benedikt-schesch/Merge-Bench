```

**Reasoning:**  
The conflicting versions (`0.6.0-alpha` vs `0.5.4`) represent ambiguous semantic intent. Without additional context about:  
1. The intended release version  
2. Version compatibility requirements  
3. Release timeline dependencies  

I cannot determine which version reflects the correct/maintainer-intended value. Both versions could be valid depending on development context (pre-release vs stable). Since the intent is unclear, the conflict remains unresolved per the guidelines.
