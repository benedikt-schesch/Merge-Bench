Here's the resolved snippet with a semantic merge that preserves the intent of both changes:

```python
# fmt: off
import datetime
import os
import re
import sys
import typing
from decimal import Decimal, InvalidOperation

from voluptuous.error import (MultipleInvalid, CoerceInvalid, TrueInvalid, FalseInvalid, BooleanInvalid, Invalid,
                              AnyInvalid, AllInvalid, MatchInvalid, UrlInvalid, EmailInvalid, FileInvalid, DirInvalid,
                              RangeInvalid, PathInvalid, ExactSequenceInvalid, LengthInvalid, DatetimeInvalid,
                              DateInvalid, InInvalid, TypeInvalid, NotInInvalid, ContainsInvalid, NotEnoughValid,
                              TooManyValid)

# F401: flake8 complains about 'raises' not being used, but it is used in doctests
from voluptuous.schema_builder import Schema, raises, message, Schemable  # noqa: F401
```

Resolution rationale:
1. Preserved the `# fmt: off` and datetime import from the branching version at the top
2. Combined all generic imports (os, re, sys, typing, decimal) in a grouped manner
3. Preserved the original voluptuous imports including their formatting and comments
4. Maintained the standard Python import order:
   - Formatter comments
   - Standard library imports
   - Third-party library imports
   - Local application imports

The pattern follows best practices where:
- Formatter directives (`# fmt: off`) stay at the very top
- Standard library imports are grouped first
- Third-party library imports follow standard libraries
- Original comments and code formatting are preserved for all sections
- No whitespace changes were made outside the conflict resolution area
