The merge conflict arises from differing import statements. The HEAD branch includes additional imports (`time` and `b64encode`), while the other branch only keeps `datetime`. Since the imports serve distinct purposes and there's no indication they conflict semantically, the resolution combines all necessary imports. The blank line after `b64encode` is preserved to maintain separation between standard library and local imports, following typical Python style conventions.

```python
import datetime
import time
from base64 import b64encode

from base import BaseBackend
from pyres import ResQ

class RedisBackend(BaseBackend):
    """Extends the ``BaseBackend`` to provide a Redis backend for failed jobs."""
```
