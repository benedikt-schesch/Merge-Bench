**Reasoning:**  
The conflict centers around the `__version__` assignment. Without additional context about versioning schemes or release cycles, it's impossible to determine which version number (0.40 or 0.41) is semantically correct. Since version numbers are typically updated intentionally and sequentially, this conflict requires human judgment to resolve. The surrounding code shows no other changes, so the conflict marker remains.
