I've analyzed the merge conflict. The conflict arises from differing whitespace between the two branches. Here's the resolved snippet:

```python
        elif isinstance(server, ResQ):
            self.resq = server
        else:
            raise Exception("Bad server argument")

    def validate_queues(self):
        """Checks if a worker is given at least one queue to work on."""
        if not self.queues:
            raise NoQueueError("Please give each worker at least one queue.")
```

### Resolution Explanation:
1. The conflict was purely about whitespace - whether to include an empty line between the `else` block and the method definition
2. Both branches have identical functional code
3. I preserved the single empty line from the second branch (commit 7c5e11d) because:
   - It follows PEP8 style guidelines for class method separation
   - Improves readability without changing functionality
   - Represents the most common Python convention
4. The context before and after the conflict markers remains unchanged
5. The typo in the docstring ("Checks") was preserved as it existed in both branches

The resolution maintains semantic equivalence while adhering to standard Python style conventions.
