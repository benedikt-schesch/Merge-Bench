I'll resolve this merge conflict by preserving both intents while maintaining proper formatting. The conflict is purely about code style - both versions are semantically identical but formatted differently. I'll choose the more readable multi-line version while preserving all functionality.

```python
class Datetime(object):
    """Validate that the value matches the datetime format."""

    DEFAULT_FORMAT = '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'

    def __init__(
        self, format: typing.Optional[str] = None, msg: typing.Optional[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        self.format = format or self.DEFAULT_FORMAT
        self.msg = msg

    def __call__(self, v):
        try:
```

Resolution reasoning:
1. Both versions define the same parameters with identical types and defaults
2. The multi-line version improves readability without changing functionality
3. The method body remains unchanged as it was identical in both branches
4. All spacing and indentation is preserved according to the context
5. The conflict markers are removed while keeping both intents

The resolution maintains the semantic meaning from both branches while using the cleaner formatting from the incoming branch. The functionality is completely preserved.
