Here's the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict resolved by combining imports from both changes and removing duplicates:

from .util import prnt, unicod, u, U_EMPTY_STRING, U_ZERO
from .phonenumberutil import format_number, PhoneNumberFormat
from .phonenumberutil import region_code_for_number, PhoneNumberType, PhoneNumber
from .phonenumberutil import country_mobile_token, national_significant_number, number_type
from .prefix import prefix_description_for_number
try:
    from .geodata import GEOCODE_DATA, GEOCODE_LONGEST_PREFIX
```

### Explanation:
1. Preserved `.util` imports from HEAD
2. Added missing imports from both sides:
   - Kept `format_number` and `PhoneNumberFormat` from HEAD
   - Added `region_code_for_number`, `PhoneNumberType`, `PhoneNumber`, `country_mobile_token`, and `national_significant_number` from the other branch
3. Removed duplicate `number_type` import (already included in branch imports)
4. Added `.prefix` import from the branch
5. Preserved all original whitespace and context lines
6. Maintained sequential ordering of imports:
   - `.util` first (from HEAD)
   - Then `.phonenumberutil` imports combined from both sides
   - Finally `.prefix` import (from branch)

The resolution combines semantic additions from both sides while removing duplicate imports and preserving code structure.
