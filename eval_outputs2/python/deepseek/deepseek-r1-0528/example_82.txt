I've analyzed the merge conflict regarding the import of `setup`. The conflict arises between:

1. The HEAD version that uses a try-except block to fall back to distutils if setuptools isn't available
2. The incoming change that directly imports from setuptools without a fallback

After considering the semantics:
- Both versions agree on using setuptools when available
- The key difference is whether to maintain compatibility with environments that only have distutils
- The Python version check (Python < 3 unsupported) suggests this is modern Python code
- Setuptools has become the de facto standard for packaging
- The direct import simplifies the code and reduces maintenance

Since the intent is clear and setuptools is now considered essential for modern Python packaging, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the direct import.

Resolved code:
```python
import sys

if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
    sys.exit('Python < 3 is unsupported.')

from setuptools import setup

url_template = 'https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/archive/v%s.tar.gz'
requirements = []

setup(
