The conflict in the docstring has been resolved by keeping the more concise formatting (without the leading space) since it's consistent with PEP 8 conventions for docstrings. The unresolved conflict in the except block is maintained since we don't have sufficient context to resolve it.

```python
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise Invalid for String"


def test_number_validation_with_invalid_precision_invalid_scale():
    """Test with Number with invalid precision and scale"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(precision=6, scale=2)})
    try:
        schema({"number": '123456.712'})
    except MultipleInvalid as e:
<<<<<<< HEAD

``` 

The resolution preserves:
1. The docstring formatting from the branch that follows standard conventions
2. The original code structure and spacing
3. The unresolved conflict in the except block due to insufficient context

Both branches:
- Use identical validation test logic
- Only differ in docstring formatting
- Add whitespace to the except block in the HEAD branch (exact intent unclear)
