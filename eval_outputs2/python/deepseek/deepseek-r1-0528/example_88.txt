The merge conflict involves imports added in one branch that are not present in the other. Since the provided snippet doesn't show the full function implementation, it's unclear whether these imports (`json`, `simplejson`, `b64encode`) are actually used later in the function. Without seeing the complete function body or understanding the broader context, I cannot determine if these imports are essential or redundant.

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```python

    def size(self):
        return str(failure.count(self.resq) or 0)

    def failed_jobs(self):
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
        from base64 import b64encode
        try:
            import json
        except ImportError:
            import simplejson as json

>>>>>>> 7c5e11da51608646c0dc8d70f8fff39ba19b0a75
        jobs = []
        for job in failure.all(self.resq, self._start, self._start + 20):
            backtrace = job['backtrace']

            if isinstance(backtrace, list):

```

The ambiguity arises because:
1. The HEAD branch doesn't include these imports
2. The other branch adds them at the start of the method
3. The visible portion of the function doesn't use these imports
4. The full function implementation isn't visible in the snippet

Without knowing if these imports are used later in the function (e.g., in code not shown in the snippet), this conflict cannot be safely resolved. The developer should manually reconcile this based on the complete implementation.
