```python
                'host': host,
                'pid':pid,
                'w':str(w)
            }
            item['queue'] = w.job().get('queue')
            if 'queue' in data:
                item['data'] = True
                item['code'] = data['payload']['class']
                item['runat'] = str(datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(float(data['run_at'])))
            else:
                item['data'] = False

```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. Both conflict versions check for existence of 'queue' key in `data`
2. `if 'queue' in data:` (HEAD version) is:
   - Modern Pythonic syntax (works in both Py2/Py3)
   - More readable and conventional
   - Avoids deprecated `.has_key()` method
3. The semantic intent is identical - conditionally populate item fields
4. No other logic changes between versions
5. Preserves all surrounding context unchanged

The resolution maintains HEAD's modern approach while keeping identical functionality from both branches.
