The duplicate imports in the conflict block are redundant since they're already present at the top. Here's the resolved version:

```python
import io
import sys

from setuptools import setup

sys.path.insert(0, '.')
version = __import__('voluptuous').__version__

with io.open('README.md', encoding='utf-8') as f:
```

Resolution reasoning:
1. Both branches have `import io` + `import sys` at the top
2. The `import sys` and `import io` in HEAD are duplicates
3. The incoming branch removes these redundant imports while preserving the same io/sys availability
4. No logical conflicts exist since setup.py can still access sys/io via top-level imports

The resolution maintains semantics by:
- Preserving initial imports
- Keeping path manipulation logic
- Maintaining version fetching
- Preserving file reading functionality
- Avoiding redundant module imports
