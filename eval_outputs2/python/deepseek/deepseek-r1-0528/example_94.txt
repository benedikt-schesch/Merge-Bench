The conflict arises from different imports added in two branches. The HEAD branch adds `warnings` and `threading`, while the other branch adds `logging`. Since these imports are independent and serve different purposes, we should include all of them. The resolved code merges all relevant imports together.

```python

# bitcointools -- modified deserialize.py to return raw transaction
import BCDataStream
import deserialize
import util
import warnings
import threading
import logging

SCHEMA_VERSION = "Abe29"

CONFIG_DEFAULTS = {
    "dbtype":       None,
