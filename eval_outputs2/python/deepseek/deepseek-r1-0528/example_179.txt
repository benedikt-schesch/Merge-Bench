To resolve this merge conflict, I analyzed the semantic intent of both branches. The conflict occurs in a TODO list within a Python docstring. 

The key observations are:
1. The HEAD branch adds 5 new TODO items (including one empty item)
2. The other branch adds no new items in this section
3. Both branches include the "- add setup.py" item after the conflict markers
4. The empty bullet point in HEAD appears to be a mistake/placeholder

The resolution combines the changes by:
- Keeping all non-empty TODO items from HEAD
- Removing the empty bullet point
- Preserving the "add setup.py" item (common to both)
- Maintaining consistent indentation

Here's the resolved code:

```python

    TODO:
        - local installation (without setup.py, package install)
        - add option --debug for compile
        - add option --profile for compile
        - debug to verbose
        - add quete
        - delete --with-npm, add --without-npm
        - save command line at creation
        - add setup.py
