The conflict arises from a formatting difference in the `assert` statement for `range_`. Both versions verify the same semantic content, but use different formatting styles. The multi-line version from the branch provides better readability and should be adopted since it enhances code clarity while maintaining identical functionality. The surrounding context remains unchanged as requested.

Resolved version:
```python
    all_ = All('10', Coerce(int), msg='all msg')
    maybe_int = Maybe(int)

    assert repr(match) == "Match('a pattern', msg='message')"
    assert repr(replace) == "Replace('you', 'I', msg='you and I')"
    assert (
        repr(range_)
        == "Range(min=0, max=42, min_included=False, max_included=False, msg='number not in range')"
    )
    assert repr(coerce_) == "Coerce(int, msg='moo')"
    assert repr(all_) == "All('10', Coerce(int, msg=None), msg='all msg')"
    assert repr(maybe_int) == "Any(None, %s, msg=None)" % str(int)


```
