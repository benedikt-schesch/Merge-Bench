The conflict arises from differences in the script name and invocation parameters between the two branches. The HEAD version uses the script name `buildgeocodingdata.py` with three parameters (`indir outfile module_prefix`), while the other branch uses `buildprefixdata.py` with two parameters (`indir outfile`). 

Since the script's purpose (processing per-prefix data to generate Python code) remains consistent in both versions, but the required parameters differ, this conflict requires semantic understanding of which invocation is correct. Without additional context about:
1. Whether `module_prefix` is a required parameter
2. Why the script name changed
3. Which branch contains the authoritative version

The conflict cannot be safely resolved automatically. Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""Script to read the libphonenumber per-prefix metadata and generate Python code.

Invocation:
<<<<<<< HEAD:tools/python/buildgeocodingdata.py
  buildgeocodingdata.py indir outfile module_prefix
=======
  buildprefixdata.py indir outfile
>>>>>>> 298c8f361a29b79085d5f926a70e863e056a33a5:tools/python/buildprefixdata.py

Processes all of the per-prefix data under the given input directory and emit
generated Python code.
