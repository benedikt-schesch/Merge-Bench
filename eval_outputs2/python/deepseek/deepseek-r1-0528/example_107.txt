Here's the resolved snippet with the conflict addressed while preserving context and semantics. Both changes are independent attribute initializations, so they can be safely combined:

```python
        self.author = None
        self.pub = None
        self.timeframe = [None, None]
        self.include_patents = True
        self.include_citations = True
        self.start = 0
        self.sort_by_date = False

    def set_words(self, words):
        """Sets words that *all* must be found in the result."""
        self.words = words


```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. Both `self.start` (likely a pagination offset) and `self.sort_by_date` (sorting toggle) are valid independent configurations
2. No semantic overlap exists - they control different aspects of functionality
3. The order between them doesn't matter logically, but follows HEAD-first convention
4. All surrounding context remains unchanged as requested

The conflict markers are removed while preserving both features' intents. The attributes are initialized in the order they appeared in their respective branches (HEAD change first).
