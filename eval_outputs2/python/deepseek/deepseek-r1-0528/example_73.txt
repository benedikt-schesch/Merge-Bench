The conflict arises from differences in formatting style around the regex flags and closing parenthesis. Both versions intend to pass the `re.IGNORECASE` flag with proper syntax, but differ in formatting:

1. **HEAD version** uses compact formatting with closing parenthesis on the same line
2. **Other branch** uses expanded formatting with:
   - Trailing comma after flag
   - Closing parenthesis on new line
   - `# fmt: on` comment (likely related to code formatter)

Since the expanded formatting improves readability for multi-line regex patterns and includes a formatting directive (# fmt: on), it's preferred. The resolution preserves functionality while accommodating project styling.

Resolved code:
```python
    # literal form, ipv4 address (SMTP 4.1.3)
    r'|^\[(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d?\d)'
    r'(\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d?\d)){3}\]$'
    # end anchor, because fullmatch is not available in python 2.7
    r")\Z",
    re.IGNORECASE,
)
# fmt: on
