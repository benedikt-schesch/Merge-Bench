)
DOMAIN_REGEX = re.compile(
    # start anchor, because fullmatch is not available in python 2.7
    "(?:"
    # domain
```

**Resolution Rationale:**  
The only difference between the two branches is a trailing comma after `re.IGNORECASE`. Both the pattern string and flag argument must be preserved. The trailing comma improves code maintainability but doesn't change functionality. This resolves the conflict by adopting the style improvement from the branch that added it.
