The conflict involves a minor stylistic difference regarding a blank line after an import statement. Both versions are functionally identical, but the resolution maintains consistency with existing code structure by removing the unnecessary blank line. The resolved code preserves the intended semantics of both branches by keeping the import and assertion statements intact while eliminating the conflict marker.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```python
        "toaster": str,
        Extra: object,
    }
    # toaster should be first.
    from voluptuous.schema_builder import _iterate_mapping_candidates
    assert _iterate_mapping_candidates(schema)[0][0] == 'toaster'


def test_in():
    """Verify that In works."""
```
