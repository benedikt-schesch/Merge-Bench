The merge conflict arises from two different approaches to validating an exception in a test case. Both versions correctly capture the exception, but validate it differently. 

The HEAD version uses an assertion on the exception message, while the incoming branch uses assertions on:
1. The number of errors in the exceptionå½“`ctx.value.errors`  
2. The type of the first error  

Combining both validations produces better test coverage. The conflict is resolved by keeping the exception context manager and the initial schema call, then applying *both* assertion types. This ensures:
1. The exception message is validated
2. The error count is checked
3. The specific error type is verified

Here's the resolved code:

```python
    with pytest.raises(
        MultipleInvalid,
        match=r"value is not allowed for dictionary value @ data\['color'\]",
    ) as ctx:
        schema({'color': ['blue', 'yellow']})
    assert len(ctx.value.errors) == 1
    assert isinstance(ctx.value.errors[0], ContainsInvalid)
    assert str(ctx.value) == "value is not allowed for dictionary value @ data['color']"


def test_remove():
    """Verify that Remove works."""
    # remove dict keys
```

Key changes:
1. Removed the `except` block (redundant since `pytest.raises` already catches the exception)
2. Kept the `ctx.value` validations from the incoming branch
3. Added a string validation using `str(ctx.value)` to preserve HEAD's intent
4. Maintained the exact context and spacing before/after the conflict
