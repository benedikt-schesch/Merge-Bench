The conflict arises from formatting differences between the two branches. Both versions assert the same schema but with different formatting:
1. HEAD uses multi-line formatting for clarity
2. The other branch uses single-line formatting for compactness

Given that:
1. The schema is simple (single key with short list of types)
2. The function immediately below (`test_schema_infer_scalar`) uses single-line assertions
3. The original variable assignment uses a single-line dictionary

The single-line version is more consistent with the surrounding code style. Here's the resolved version:

```python


def test_schema_infer_list():
    schema = Schema.infer({'list': ['foo', True, 42, 3.14]})

    assert schema == Schema({Required('list'): [str, bool, int, float]})


def test_schema_infer_scalar():
    assert Schema.infer('foo') == Schema(str)
    assert Schema.infer(True) == Schema(bool)

```
