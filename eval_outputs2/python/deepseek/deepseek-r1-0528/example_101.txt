Based on the provided context, I'll resolve the merge conflict by keeping both semantic intentions. The `coverage` import from HEAD appears to be a legitimate addition that doesn't conflict with the other branch's structure. Here's the resolved version:

```python
try:
    from cStringIO import StringIO
except ImportError:
    from io import StringIO
from contextlib import contextmanager
import coverage
from functools import reduce


def prepare_config():
    """This function, used before importing ivre.db, will make IVRE
```

### Resolution Explanation:
1. **Conflict Analysis**: 
   - HEAD adds `import coverage` 
   - Other branch (d5fc415) doesn't modify this import section
2. **Semantic Compatibility**:
   - The `coverage` import doesn't conflict with existing functionality
   - Both branches agree on surrounding imports (`contextmanager` and `functools.reduce`)
   - Preserving `coverage` maintains HEAD's new functionality without breaking the other branch
3. **Code Integrity**:
   - Import order remains logical (standard libraries â†’ third-party imports)
   - No spacing changes made to preserve original formatting
   - The resolved version satisfies both branches' intentions

The conflict was straightforward since it involved a new import that didn't interfere with existing code structure.
