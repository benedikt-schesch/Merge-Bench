The conflict arises from two different branches adding distinct keys to the same dictionary. Both `'start'` and `'sortby'` are valid keys with different purposes, so they should coexist. Here's the resolved snippet:

```python
                   'pub': self.pub or '',
                   'ylo': self.timeframe[0] or '',
                   'yhi': self.timeframe[1] or '',
                   'patents': '0' if self.include_patents else '1',
                   'citations': '0' if self.include_citations else '1',
                   'start': self.start or '0',
                   'sortby': '1' if self.sort_by_date else '0'}

        for key, val in urlargs.items():
            urlargs[key] = quote(encode(val))

        # The following URL arguments must not be quoted, or the
```

**Resolution rationale:**  
1. Both keys (`start` and `sortby`) serve different aren aren't mutually exclusive
2. The dictionary syntax allows multiple key-value pairs to coexist
3. No overlapping functionality exists between the two additions
4. The comma after `'start'` line ensures proper syntax when adding `'sortby'`

The conflict is resolved by including both changes while maintaining dictionary structure and syntax.
