The merge conflict in the function definition is unresolvable due to semantic differences between the branches. The HEAD side shows a focused `csv()` function that only handles article output, while the incoming branch presents a more complex function that also handles query initialization and execution. Without clear context about which functionality should take precedence, the conflict is left unresolved.

Here is the exact snippet with the conflict preserved:

```python
>>>>>>> c5579c42facf5b55b3bcf7db98277b5504ffaeb2
    articles = querier.articles
    for art in articles:
        print(art.as_txt() + '\n')

<<<<<<< HEAD
def csv(querier, header=False, sep='|'):
=======
def csv(query, author, count, bycluster=False, header=False, sep='|'):
    querier = ScholarQuerier(author=author, count=count, bycluster=bycluster)
    if bycluster:
        querier.querybycluster(query)
    else:
        querier.query(query)
>>>>>>> c5579c42facf5b55b3bcf7db98277b5504ffaeb2
    articles = querier.articles
    for art in articles:
        result = art.as_csv(header=header, sep=sep)
        print(encode(result))
        header = False

```
