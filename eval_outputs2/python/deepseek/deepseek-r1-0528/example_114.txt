```python
    client = get_redis(system)
    if use_pipeline:
        client = client.pipeline()

    for obj_class in obj_classes:
        client.setbit(obj_class.from_date(event_name, now).redis_key, uuid, 1)

    if use_pipeline:
        client.execute()


def get_event_names(system='default', prefix='', batch=10000):
    """
    Return the list of all event names, with no particular order. Optional
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
- Preserved the other branch's (`1e6dd6e9`) pipeline execution logic which correctly uses `client.execute()` conditionally only when a pipeline is in use
- The loop uses the unified `client` variable (instead of `p`)
- Setbit value matches the other branch's explicit `1`, as the HEAD's `value` variable lacks context and sets bit to 1 unconditionally in the other branch
- The resolution retains proper structure with pipeline execution *after* the loop at the same indentation level
- Blank line before conditional execute is preserved per the other branch's formatting

(Note: The other branch's implementation was chosen primarily due to the critical pipeline fix that avoids illegal execute() calls on non-pipeline clients, while the value difference was resolved using explicit 1 due to lack of context for variability.)
