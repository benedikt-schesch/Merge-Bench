Here's the resolved code snippet preserving context while merging both intents:

```python
                        center_pos = dlg.GetPosition()
                        center_pos[1] -= 150
                        dlg.SetPosition(center_pos)

                    if dlg.ShowModal() == wx.ID_OK:
                        # If the dialog has collected a torrent, use the new tdef
                        tdef = dlg.GetCollected() or tdef
                        cdef = sdef or tdef

                        # for multifile we enabled correctedFilenames, use split to remove the filename from the path
                        if tdef and tdef.is_multifile_torrent():
                            destdir, correctedFilename = os.path.split(dlg.GetPath())
                            selectedFiles = dlg.GetSelectedFiles()
                        else:
                            destdir = dlg.GetPath()
```

Resolution rationale:
1. Preserved the HEAD branch's critical logic that updates `tdef` and `cdef` based on dialog results
2. Kept the other branch's improved comment formatting (added space after `#`)
3. Maintained semantic flow by keeping:
   - Torrent definition updates (essential business logic)
   - Multifile handling comment (documentation improvement)
   - Subsequent file processing logic (unchanged common context)
4. The changes are complementary - HEAD adds new functionality while the other branch improves documentation

The conflict was resolvable because:
- The logic from HEAD is new functionality that should be preserved
- The comment change from the other branch is purely cosmetic
- Both changes affect adjacent but non-overlapping concerns
- No ambiguity exists in the combined intents
