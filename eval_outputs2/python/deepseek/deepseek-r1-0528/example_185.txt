I've analyzed the merge conflict and determined that it cannot be safely resolved with the given information. The conflict involves an import statement for `sys` which may or may not be needed for the `rldecode` function. Since the function implementation isn't shown and I can't determine if `sys` is actually used, it would be unsafe to resolve this conflict automatically.

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```python
# version 1.4 section 3.3.4.
#
#  * public domain *
#

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import sys


>>>>>>> 2caa5edc256cb2b3dbbff41e79ea2b16b3b69f06
def rldecode(data):
    """
    RunLength decoder (Adobe version) implementation based on PDF Reference
    version 1.4 section 3.3.4:
        The RunLengthDecode filter decodes data that has been encoded in a

```

To resolve this conflict, a developer should:
1. Check if `sys` is actually used in `rldecode` or elsewhere in the module
2. If used, keep the import and remove the conflict markers
3. If not used, remove the import and conflict markers
4. Adjust blank lines for consistent formatting

Without seeing the full implementation of `rldecode`, I cannot make this determination safely.
