The conflict involves a trivial whitespace difference in a method call. Both versions achieve the same functionality - removing carriage returns and splitting content into lines. The branch version (without space after comma) matches the surrounding code's style (e.g., `open(abs_path,'rb')`). 

Resolved version:
```python
    global STOP_WORDS
    abs_path = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), stop_words_path))
    if not os.path.exists(abs_path):
        raise Exception("jieba: path does not exist: " + abs_path)
    content = open(abs_path,'rb').read().decode('utf-8')
    lines = content.replace("\r","").split('\n')
    for line in lines:
        STOP_WORDS.add(line)

def extract_tags(sentence, topK=20, withWeight=False):
    """
