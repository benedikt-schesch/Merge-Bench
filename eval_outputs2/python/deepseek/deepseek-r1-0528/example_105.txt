The conflict arises from differing variable names (`font_type` vs `suffix`) and condition logic in the `elif` statements. After analyzing both changes:

1. The branch introducing `suffix` adds support for "pfb" font types
2. The HEAD branch maintains support for empty string font types (`font_type == ""`)
3. Both branches handle "afm" types identically

The resolution preserves both changes by:
- Using the `suffix` variable for consistency with the updated logic
- Expanding the condition to include both "pfb" and empty string support
- Maintaining identical handling logic within the blocks

Here's the resolved version:

```python
                                addMapping(fontName, bold, italic, fullFontName)

                    # Register "normal" name and the place holder for style
                    self.registerFont(fontName, [*fontAlias, fullFontName])

            elif suffix in {"afm", "pfb", ""}:
                if suffix == "afm":
                    afm = file.getNamedFile()
                    tfile = pisaFileObject(baseName + ".pfb", basepath=file.basepath)
                    pfb = tfile.getNamedFile()
                else:
                    pfb = file.getNamedFile()
```
