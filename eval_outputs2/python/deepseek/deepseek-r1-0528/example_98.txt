The conflict arises from differing `__version__` assignments. After analyzing the semantics:

1. Both branches agree that a version declaration is needed
2. The HEAD branch (`2.2a1`) appears to be the main development line with a newer version
3. The other branch (`2.1.2a1`) seems to be a patch/hotfix branch
4. When merging into main development, we should retain the newer version

Resolved version maintains semantic versioning while keeping the main branch's progression:

```python
from .choices import Choices
from .tracker import FieldTracker, ModelTracker

__version__ = '2.2a1'

```
