```python
    digest_size = new().digest_size

except ImportError:
    import md5
    hashFactory = md5
    digest_size = 16

```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. Preserved the `hashFactory` assignment from HEAD since it's needed for functionality
2. Kept the `digest_size = 16` assignment but moved it inside the except block where it logically belongs
3. Removed the problematic conditional from the other branch since:
   - `digestsize` isn't defined in local scope (should be `md5.digestsize`)
   - MD5 digest size is always 16 regardless of attribute checks
   - `del md5` would break `hashFactory` reference
4. Maintained consistent indentation and spacing
5. The combined solution ensures:
   - Fallback to MD5 works correctly
   - digest_size is properly set (16 for MD5)
   - hashFactory is available for cryptographic operations
   - No namespace pollution from temporary variables
