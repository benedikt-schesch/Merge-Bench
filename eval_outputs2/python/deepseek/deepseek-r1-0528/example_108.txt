Here's the resolved code snippet preserving all context while merging both changes. I've included both methods from each branch in the order they appeared:

```python
        self.include_citations = yesorno

    def set_include_patents(self, yesorno):
        self.include_patents = yesorno

    def set_start_index(self, index):
        self.start = index

    def set_sort_by_date(self, yesorno):
        self.sort_by_date = yesorno

    def get_url(self):
        if self.words is None and self.words_some is None \
           and self.words_none is None and self.phrase is None \
           and self.author is None and self.pub is None \
```

Reasoning:
1. Both `set_start_index` and `set_sort_by_date` are independent methods that don't conflict semantically
2. The order preserves the HEAD version first followed by the branch version
3. No other context was modified - all surrounding code remains unchanged
4. The resolution maintains the functionality from both branches by adding both setters
5. Spacing and indentation are preserved exactly as in the original context

This solution cleanly integrates both changes since they serve different purposes:
- `set_start_index` controls pagination/indexing
- `set_sort_by_date` controls sorting behavior
They can peacefully coexist in the class interface.
