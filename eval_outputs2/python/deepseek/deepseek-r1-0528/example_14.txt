The conflict arises from the addition of formatting directives (`# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on`) around the import statement in one branch, while the other branch simply has the import. Both branches agree on the core content (`import typing`), so we preserve the formatting directives as they provide additional semantic value (disabling formatters for that section). 

The resolved code maintains the formatting directives and preserves the original spacing/context exactly:

```python
# fmt: off
import typing

# fmt: on

class Error(Exception):
    """Base validation exception."""
