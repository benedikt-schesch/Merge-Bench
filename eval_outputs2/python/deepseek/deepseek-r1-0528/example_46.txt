Here's the resolved snippet preserving surrounding context and resolving the conflict based on semantic intent:

```python
    out_ = schema({"number": '123456789012.00'})
    assert float(out_.get("number")) == 123456789012.00


def test_number_when_precision_none_n_invalid_scale_yield_decimal_true():
    """Test with Number with no precision and invalid scale"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(scale=2, yield_decimal=True)})
    try:
        schema({"number": '12345678901.234'})
    except MultipleInvalid as e:
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. Both versions of the conflict are semantically identical - they convey the same documentation purpose
2. The only difference is a minor whitespace style in the docstring opening
3. I preserved the cleaner version without leading space after `"""` as it's more common in Python docstrings
4. The rest of the test implementation remains unchanged as it was identical in both versions

The resolution maintains:
- Original test behavior
- Both authors' documentation intent
- Consistent Python docstring styling
- Unchanged implementation logic before/after the conflict
