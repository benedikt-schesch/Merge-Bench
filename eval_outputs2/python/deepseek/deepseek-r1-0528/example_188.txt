The conflict centers around the initialization of `multi_string` and its usage in the loop. Since the loop context is incomplete and the purpose of `multi_string` is ambiguous without seeing its usage in the loop body, I cannot safely resolve this conflict. Both branches might be implementing different logic (string detection vs. comment detection), and merging them without understanding the full context could introduce errors.

Here's the original snippet with conflicts preserved:

```python
                "code_text": code
            })

    # Setup the variables to get ready to check for multiline comments
    multi_line = False
<<<<<<< HEAD
    multi_string = False
=======
>>>>>>> bbeee06f1222fa47439717d2e4b642a41e9d7f4b
    multistart, multiend = language.get("multistart"), language.get("multiend")
    comment_matcher = language['comment_matcher']

    for line in lines:
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

Key observations:
1. **HEAD branch** initializes `multi_string = False` (likely for tracking multi-line strings)
2. **Other branch** omits `multi_string` (possibly focusing only on comments)
3. The loop below contains another conflict marker (unresolvable without more context)
4. Without seeing how `multi_string` is used in the loop body, we can't determine if these changes are compatible

Recommendation: A human should review:
- Whether multi-line string detection is needed
- How both branches use `multi_line`/`multi_string` in the loop
- The conflict in the `for line in lines` block below
