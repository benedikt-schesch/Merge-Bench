The merge conflict is resolved by selecting the incoming version since it maintains better readability with a multi-line format for the function signature, which is preferred for longer function definitions. Both versions have identical parameters and functionality, so the intent is preserved while enhancing code clarity.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```python
    ...  validate(['three'])
    ... except er.MultipleInvalid as e:
    ...   assert isinstance(e.errors[0], er.RangeInvalid)
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        schema: Schemable,
        msg: str,
        cls: typing.Optional[typing.Type[Error]] = None,
    ) -> None:
        if cls and not issubclass(cls, er.Invalid):
            raise er.SchemaError(
                "Msg can only use subclases of Invalid as custom class"
            )
        self._schema = schema

```
