Here's the resolved snippet preserving context and spacing while resolving the semantic conflict:

```python
        if self.order is not None:
            d['order'] = self.order
        return d

    def save(self, using=None):
        es = connections.get_connection(using or self._index._using)
        return es.indices.put_template(name=self._template_name, body=self.to_dict())

class Index(object):
    def __init__(self, name, using='default'):
        """
        :arg name: name of the index
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. **Connection method:** Both versions aim to get an Elasticsearch connection, but use different approaches:
   - HEAD uses `get_connection()` (likely a module-level function)
   - Other branch uses `connections.get_connection()` (more explicit object-oriented approach)
   The `connections` version is preferred as it's more standard in Elasticsearch DSL patterns and avoids potential import ambiguity.

2. **Return value:** 
   - HEAD version discards the API response
   - Other branch returns the response from `put_template()`
   Returning the response is more useful as it allows callers to check operation status.

3. **Semantic compatibility:** The other branch's implementation:
   - Maintains the core functionality (saving the template)
   - Provides enhanced usability by returning the API response
   - Uses more explicit connection handling

The resolved version keeps the best aspects of both changes while maintaining backward compatibility since callers can still ignore the return value if needed.
