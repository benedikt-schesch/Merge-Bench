The merge conflict centers around the `process_as_code` variable declaration in the loop. Since the surrounding context doesn't show how this variable is used later in the code, I can't determine whether:
1. The `process_as_code` variable is critical to HEAD's logic (so it should be kept)
2. The other branch intentionally removed it (so it should be omitted)
3. The variable is related to other changes not shown in the snippet

Given this ambiguity in the semantic intent of both branches, I'm returning the unresolved conflict:

```python
>>>>>>> bbeee06f1222fa47439717d2e4b642a41e9d7f4b
    multistart, multiend = language.get("multistart"), language.get("multiend")
    comment_matcher = language['comment_matcher']

    for line in lines:
<<<<<<< HEAD
        process_as_code = False

>>>>>>> bbeee06f1222fa47439717d2e4b642a41e9d7f4b
        # Only go into multiline comments section when one of the delimiters is
        # found to be at the start of a line
        if multistart and multiend and \
            any(line.lstrip().startswith(delim) or line.rstrip().endswith(delim)
                for delim in (multistart, multiend)):
