The merge conflict involves different definitions of `PHONE_ALT_FORMAT_359`. The HEAD version contains one phone number format pattern, while the other branch contains three patterns (including one for a different leading digit '2' and an additional format pattern). 

The intent of the HEAD version is unclear - it might be:
1. A simplification/optimization removing unused formats
2. An update where the removed formats became invalid
3. A version where additional formats hadn't been added yet

The other branch clearly adds new formatting rules. Since the HEAD modification could be intentional removal or come from an older version, and because the formats conflict for the same leading digit patterns, I can't safely resolve this without knowing:
- If the additional formats in the other branch are still needed
- Why HEAD has a different version
- Whether the formats are mutually exclusive

Here's the original code with conflict markers preserved:

```python
"""Auto-generated file, do not edit by hand. 359 metadata"""
from ..phonemetadata import NumberFormat

<<<<<<< HEAD
PHONE_ALT_FORMAT_359 = [NumberFormat(pattern='(\\d{3})(\\d{3})(\\d{3})', format='\\1 \\2 \\3', leading_digits_pattern=['48|8[7-9]|9[08]'])]
