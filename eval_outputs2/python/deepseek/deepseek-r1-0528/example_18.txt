The conflict involves a duplicate import statement for `typing`. The original import already exists at the top of the snippet from the common ancestor. The conflicting HEAD commit added a redundant `import typing` statement below while the conflicting commit 1fcf849f correctly omitted it. 

The resolution is straightforward: we remove the redundant import while preserving all other context, spacing, and formatting. The duplicate import adds no value and should be eliminated for cleanliness.

```python
import typing

from voluptuous import Invalid, MultipleInvalid
from voluptuous.error import Error
from voluptuous.schema_builder import Schema

# fmt: on

MAX_VALIDATION_ERROR_ITEM_LENGTH = 500
