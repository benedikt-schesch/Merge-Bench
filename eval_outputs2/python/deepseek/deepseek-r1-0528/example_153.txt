The merge conflict involves a print statement added in one branch versus the base code in the main branch. The print statement appears to be a debugging artifact (written in Swiss German) that doesn't align with the surrounding logic. Since its purpose is ambiguous and it uses Python 2 syntax in context that appears to be Python 3, resolving it could introduce unintended behavior or syntax errors.

Given the ambiguity around intent and semantic purpose, the conflict remains unresolved as per the instructions.

```python
def resolve_results(scopes):
    """ Here we follow the results - to get what we really want """
    result = []
    for s in scopes:
        if isinstance(s, parsing.Import):
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
            print 'dini mueter, steile griech!'
>>>>>>> 118908f3118ef557502dd35ca10a98ca547f3ce1
            try:
                scope = follow_import(s)
                #for r in resolve_results([follow_import(s)]):
                #    if isinstance(r, parsing.Import):
                #        resolve_results(r)
```
