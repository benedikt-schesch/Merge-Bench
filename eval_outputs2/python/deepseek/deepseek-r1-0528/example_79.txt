I'll resolve the conflict by merging the usage strings from both branches, preserving the new `--print-completion` option from the feature branch and the `--dry-run` option from HEAD. Here's the resolved snippet:

```python

    def test_help(self):
        result = run_command.run_command(self.tmp_dir, "trash-empty",
                                         ['--help'])
        self.assertEqual(["""\
usage: trash-empty [-h] [--print-completion {bash,zsh,tcsh}] [--version]
                   [--trash-dir TRASH_DIR] [--all-users] [-i] [-f] [--dry-run]
                   [days]

Purge trashed files.

positional arguments:
```

This resolution:
1. Keeps the new `--print-completion` option from the feature branch
2. Preserves the `--dry-run` option from HEAD
3. Maintains all other options from both branches
4. Keeps the positional `[days]` argument
5. Preserves the exact formatting and indentation of the usage string
6. Maintains the surrounding context exactly as provided

The merged usage string now includes all options from both branches while maintaining the semantic meaning of both changes - supporting shell completion configuration and dry-run functionality.
