The conflict arises from two different definitions of `PHONE_ALT_FORMAT_31`. The HEAD version defines one number format pattern, while the other branch adds a second number format pattern while keeping the first. Both patterns serve different phone number formats (different digit groupings), so they should coexist. The unicode prefix (`u`) in the other branch is unnecessary in Python 3 and can be safely removed for consistency.

Here's the resolved version:

```python
"""Auto-generated file, do not edit by hand. 31 metadata"""
from ..phonemetadata import NumberFormat

PHONE_ALT_FORMAT_31 = [NumberFormat(pattern='([1-578]\\d)(\\d{4})(\\d{3})', format='\\1 \\2 \\3', leading_digits_pattern=['1[035]|2[0346]|3[03568]|4[0356]|5[0358]|7|8[4578]']), NumberFormat(pattern='([1-5]\\d{2})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})', format='\\1 \\2 \\3 \\4', leading_digits_pattern=['1[16-8]|2[259]|3[124]|4[17-9]|5[124679]'])]
```
