```python
def test_fix_157():
    s = Schema(All([Any('one', 'two', 'three')]), Length(min=1))
    assert ['one'] == s(['one'])
    with pytest.raises(MultipleInvalid):
        s(['four'])


def test_range_inside():
    s = Schema(Range(min=0, max=10))
    assert 5 == s(5)
```

The conflict resolution maintains the semantic intent of both changes:
1. The HEAD version used `pytest.raises` as a function call
2. The branch version used `pytest.raises` as a context manager

The context manager approach (from the branch) is preferred because:
- It's the modern pytest convention
- It maintains proper indentation/scoping
- It's more readable and explicit
- The functionality remains identical (testing that `s(['four'])` raises MultipleInvalid)

The surrounding context remains unchanged with preserved spacing. The resolution removes the conflict markers while keeping the branch's implementation which better follows current testing best practices.
