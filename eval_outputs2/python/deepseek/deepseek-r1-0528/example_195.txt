The conflict arises from different import statements in the two branches. The HEAD branch includes imports for `__future__`, `pyglet`, and `sys`, while the other branch adds standard library imports (`math`, `random`, `time`, `deque`). Since these imports serve different purposes and don't conflict semantically, we merge them by including all imports. The `__future__` import should remain at the top.

Resolved code:
```python
from __future__ import division

from pyglet.gl import *
from pyglet.window import key
import sys
import math
import random
import time

from collections import deque
```
