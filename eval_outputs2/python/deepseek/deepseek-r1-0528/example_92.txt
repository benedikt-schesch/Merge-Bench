```python
            'run_at': str(int(time.mktime(datetime.datetime.now().timetuple()))),
            'payload': job._payload
        }
        data = json.dumps(data)
        self.resq.redis["resque:worker:%s" % str(self)] = data
        logger.debug("worker:%s" % str(self))
        logger.debug(self.resq.redis["resque:worker:%s" % str(self)])

    def done_working(self):
        logger.info('done working')
        self.processed()
        self.resq.redis.delete("resque:worker:%s" % str(self))

```

**Reasoning:**  
Both sides aim to log worker information, but use different logging methods (`logger` vs `logging`). The surrounding context consistently uses `logger` (see `logger.info` in `done_working`). Maintaining `logger` ensures:
1. Semantic consistency throughout the class
2. Preserved logging behavior (assuming `logger` is a configured instance)
3. Avoids mixing logging approaches in the same module

The conflict is resolvable since the intent is clear and the change maintains consistency with existing code patterns.
