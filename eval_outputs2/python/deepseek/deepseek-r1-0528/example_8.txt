Here's the resolved code snippet with the conflict markers removed. I've preserved the context and spacing exactly as provided, while resolving the semantic conflict by keeping the instance variable for the top separator (from HEAD) since it appears to be intentionally preserved for later access/modification, while keeping the local variable for the bottom separator as both branches agree on that approach.

```python
        self.hSizer_panel = wx.Panel(self, -1)
        self.hSizer_panel.SetSizer(self.hSizer_labels)
        self.hSizer_panel.SetBackgroundColour(FILTER_GREY)
        self.hSizer_panel.SetMinSize((-1, 25))
        vSizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)
        self.top_separator = wx.Panel(self, size = (-1, 1))
        self.top_separator.SetBackgroundColour(SEPARATOR_GREY)
        vSizer.Add(self.top_separator, 0, wx.EXPAND)
        vSizer.Add(self.hSizer_panel, 0, wx.EXPAND)
        separator = wx.Panel(self, size=(-1, 1))
        separator.SetBackgroundColour(SEPARATOR_GREY)
        vSizer.Add(separator, 0, wx.EXPAND)
        vSizer.Add(self.hSizer_panels, 1, wx.EXPAND)
```

Key resolution rationale:
1. The HEAD version uses `self.top_separator` suggesting the separator needs to persist as an instance attribute (likely for later UI manipulation)
2. The other branch uses a local variable `separator` which matches the pattern used for the bottom separator
3. Both versions share identical functionality for:
   - Adding the separator to the sizer
   - Color configuration
   - Bottom separator implementation
4. Preserving `self.top_separator` maintains potential future access needs while keeping the bottom separator as a local variable maintains consistency with both branches' implementations for that element
5. Spacing/formatting differences were preserved exactly as they appeared in their respective branches
