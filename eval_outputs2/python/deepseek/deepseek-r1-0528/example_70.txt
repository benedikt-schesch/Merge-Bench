The conflict involves method signature formatting choices that don't affect functionality. Both sides introduce identical type annotations for the `__init__` parameters, differing only in whitespace usage. The version from `1fcf849` uses better PEP8-compliant formatting by splitting the parameters over multiple lines for improved readability.

Here's the resolved code with appropriate formatting:

```python


class NotIn(object):
    """Validate that a value is not in a collection."""

    def __init__(
        self, container: typing.Iterable, msg: typing.Optional[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        self.container = container
        self.msg = msg

    def __call__(self, v):
        try:

```

Key resolution points:
1. Preserved all type annotations (`typing.Iterable` and `typing.Optional[str]`)
2. Kept the multi-line signature from the `1fcf849` commit for better readability
3. Maintained identical parameter names and default value (`= None`)
4. Rest of the context remains unchanged per requirements

This resolves the conflict while retaining both semantic intent and the preferred code structure. The formatting choice doesn't alter behavior but improves maintainability through standard Python styling.
