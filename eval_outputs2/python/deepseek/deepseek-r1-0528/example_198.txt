I'll help resolve this semantic merge conflict. The issue is a variable name typo - both branches intend to define the same constant value but with different spellings. Here's the resolved version:

```python
DEFAULT_GRIDSIZE  = 20000
DEFAULT_GRIDSEED  = 0
DEFAULT_NUMDESIGN = 2

DEFAULT_NUMSPRAY  = 10
DEFAULT_SPRAYSTD  = 1e-3

VERBOSE = False


def init(options):
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. Both branches agree on the constant value `1e-3`
2. `DEFAULT_SPRAYSTD` (HEAD version) is the correct spelling:
   - Matches `DEFAULT_NUMSPRAY` naming pattern
   - "SPRAY" is correctly spelled (vs "SPARY" in the other branch)
3. The constant's semantic meaning (spray standard deviation) is identical in both branches
4. No functional difference - only a naming correction

The conflict is resolved by keeping the correctly spelled variable name while preserving the agreed-upon constant value.
