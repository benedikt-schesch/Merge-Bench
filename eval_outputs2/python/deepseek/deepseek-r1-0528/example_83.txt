I'll resolve this conflict by preserving the semantic intent while maintaining consistent formatting. Both sides are trying to achieve the same functionality (fixing localhost references when a new domain is provided), but with different indentation styles.

The resolution maintains the HEAD version's indentation (8 spaces) for consistency with the surrounding code block.

```python
                print "fixing links in ", filepath
                newtext = fixLinks(filetext, parser)
                with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
                    f.write(newtext)

        # fix all localhost references, if new domain given
        if arguments['--new-domain']:
            filetypes = ['*.html', '*.xml', '*.xsl', 'robots.txt']
            for root, dirs, filenames in os.walk(static_path):
                for extension in filetypes:
                    for filename in fnmatch.filter(filenames, extension):
```

Key resolution points:
1. Kept the HEAD version's 8-space indentation for the comment to match the `if` statement below
2. Removed the conflict markers while preserving all functional code
3. Maintained consistent indentation throughout the block
4. Preserved the identical functionality from both branches
5. Kept all surrounding context unchanged including spacing
