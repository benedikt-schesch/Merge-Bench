After analyzing the merge conflict, I've determined that the semantic intent of both versions is identical - they aim to implement the same constructor with type hints. The only difference is formatting style. Here's the resolved version:

```python
    >>> validate = Schema(Match(re.compile(r'0x[A-F0-9]+', re.I)))
    >>> validate('0x123ef4')
    '0x123ef4'
    """

    def __init__(
        self, pattern: typing.Union[re.Pattern, str], msg: typing.Optional[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if isinstance(pattern, basestring):
            pattern = re.compile(pattern)
        self.pattern = pattern
        self.msg = msg


```

Resolution rationale:
1. I chose the multi-line formatting (from the branch commit) because:
   - It improves readability for type-annotated parameters
   - Matches common Python styling guides (PEP 8)
   - Maintains consistency with surrounding code formatting
2. Both versions implement identical functionality:
   - Parameter types and names match exactly
   - Default value for `msg` is the same
   - Return type annotation is identical
3. The surrounding context remains completely unchanged:
   - Docstring above is preserved verbatim
   - Method body after conflict remains unchanged
   - Spacing/exact indentation is maintained per requirements

The selected formatting enhances readability without altering functionality or semantics.
