```python
    uan=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    voicemail=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    no_international_dialling=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='800\\d{5}', possible_number_pattern='\\d{8}', example_number='80012345'),
    national_prefix='0',
    national_prefix_for_parsing='0',
    number_format=[NumberFormat(pattern='(\\d{2})(\\d{3})(\\d{4})', format='\\1 \\2 \\3', leading_digits_pattern=['[235]'], national_prefix_formatting_rule='0\\1'),
        NumberFormat(pattern='(\\d{3})(\\d{5})', format='\\1 \\2', leading_digits_pattern=['8'], national_prefix_formatting_rule='0\\1')],
    mobile_number_portable_region=True)
```

Resolution reasoning:
1. Preserved both semantic improvements:
   - Kept HEAD's string formatting without redundant 'u' prefixes (consistent with surrounding code)
   - Kept the valuable `mobile_number_portable_region` flag from the other branch
2. Maintained correct Python syntax:
   - Added trailing comma after number_format list to support new field
   - Kept proper closing parenthesis structure
3. Resolved conflict by recognizing complementary changes:
   - HEAD improved string literal consistency
   - Other branch added meaningful metadata
4. Preserved all surrounding context exactly as provided
5. The solution combines both branches' semantic improvements without ambiguity
