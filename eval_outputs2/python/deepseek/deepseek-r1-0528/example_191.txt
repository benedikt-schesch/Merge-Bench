I'll return the code snippet with the conflict preserved since the intent appears ambiguous. The variable `process_as_code` introduced in the HEAD branch isn't used in the other branch, and it's unclear whether the conditional logic should be retained or removed without more context about the overall functionality.

```python
                save(docs_text, code_text)
                has_code = docs_text = code_text = ''
            docs_text += re.sub(comment_matcher, "", line) + "\n"

        else:
<<<<<<< HEAD
            process_as_code = True

        if(process_as_code):
=======
>>>>>>> bbeee06f1222fa47439717d2e4b642a41e9d7f4b
            if code_text and any(line.lstrip().startswith(x)
                                 for x in ['class ', 'def ', '@']):
                if not code_text.lstrip().startswith("@"):
                    save(docs_text, code_text)
                    code_text = has_code = docs_text = ''

```
