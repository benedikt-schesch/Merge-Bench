The conflict arose between two branches regarding additional cleanup and initialization steps at the end of an nmap test method. The HEAD branch added coverage-saving steps and a scancli initialization test. The other branch removed these lines since:
1. Coverage should be handled at the suite level, not mid-test
2. The initialization call didn't fit semantically between test methods
3. The following test already handles its own initialization

The resolved version removes the conflicting lines to maintain:
1. Proper test separation
2. Clean test structure
3. Supported coverage collection strategy

```python
            "nmap_tophop",
            list(ivre.db.db.nmap.topvalues("hop"))[0]['_id'])
        self.check_value(
            "nmap_tophop_10+",
            list(ivre.db.db.nmap.topvalues("hop>10"))[0]['_id'])
    def test_passive(self):

        # Init DB
        self.assertEqual(RUN(["./bin/ipinfo.py", "--count"])[1], "0\n")
```
