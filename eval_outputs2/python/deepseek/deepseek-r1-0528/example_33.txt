```python

    assert 'example@example.com"', out_.get("url")


def test_email_validation_with_none():
    """Test with invalid None email address"""
    schema = Schema({"email": Email()})
    with pytest.raises(
        MultipleInvalid,
        match=r"expected an email address for dictionary value @ data\['email'\]",
    ) as ctx:

```

The conflict was about docstring formatting preferences. Both versions conveyed identical meaning and intent - describing a test for invalid None email address. The resolved version uses the more common single-line docstring convention without leading/trailing spaces inside the quotes, which:
- Better aligns with PEP 257 recommendations
- Matches typical Python docstring style
- Maintains semantic equivalence
- Avoids unnecessary spacing characters

No functional changes were made, preserving the test's behavior exactly as both branches intended.
