After analyzing the conflict, I've determined both versions are semantically equivalent but differ in formatting preferences. The resolution selects the multi-line version for better readability while preserving identical behavior and function signature. The main changes are:

1. Maintaining the multi-line format from the other branch for improved readability
2. Preserving the exact same function signature parameters and types 
3. Keeping the docstring and outer context unchanged

Here's the resolved code:

```python

    def __hash__(self):
        return object.__hash__(self)


def message(
    default: typing.Optional[str] = None,
    cls: typing.Optional[typing.Type[Error]] = None,
) -> typing.Callable:
    """Convenience decorator to allow functions to provide a message.

    Set a default message:

        >>> @message('not an integer')

```
