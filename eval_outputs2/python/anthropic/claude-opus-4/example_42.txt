Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they're both updating the docstring format. The only difference is:
- HEAD version: uses a space after the opening triple quotes
- Other version: removes the space after the opening triple quotes

The semantic intent is identical - both want to document that this test validates a Number with valid precision and scale. The conflict is purely stylistic.

Since the more common Python convention is to not have a space after the opening triple quotes in docstrings (as per PEP 257), I'll resolve this by choosing the version without the space.

```python
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise Invalid for String"


def test_number_validation_with_valid_precision_scale_yield_decimal_true():
    """Test with Number with valid precision and scale"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(precision=6, scale=2, yield_decimal=True)})
    out_ = schema({"number": '1234.00'})
    assert float(out_.get("number")) == 1234.00



```
