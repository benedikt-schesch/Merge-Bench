Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

1. **HEAD (left side)**: The script is named `buildgeocodingdata.py` and takes 3 arguments: `indir outfile module_prefix`
2. **Right side**: The script is named `buildprefixdata.py` and takes 2 arguments: `indir outfile`

The conflict appears to be about:
- The script name (buildgeocodingdata.py vs buildprefixdata.py)
- The number of command-line arguments (3 vs 2)

Since the docstring mentions "per-prefix metadata" and the right side uses "buildprefixdata.py", it seems like the right side is more aligned with the described functionality. However, the HEAD side adds an additional `module_prefix` parameter which might be a needed enhancement.

Without more context about the actual implementation and requirements, I cannot determine which version is correct or if both changes are needed. Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
