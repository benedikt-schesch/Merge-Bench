Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import the same modules (`sys` and `io`), but in different positions in the file.

- The HEAD version has the imports after the `setuptools` import
- The other branch (1fcf849...) has the imports at the top of the file (which is the standard Python convention)

Since both sides want the same imports and the conventional Python style is to have all imports at the top of the file, the semantic intent is clear: we need `io` and `sys` imports, and they should be at the top.

Here's the resolved version:

```python
import io
import sys

from setuptools import setup

sys.path.insert(0, '.')
version = __import__('voluptuous').__version__


with io.open('README.md', encoding='utf-8') as f:
