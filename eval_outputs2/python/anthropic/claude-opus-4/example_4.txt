Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - creating a `LinkText` widget - but with slightly different formatting:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Has spacing around the `=` signs in the function arguments and includes an additional line setting the background color
- **d523b6a054** (incoming branch): Has no spacing around the `=` signs in the function arguments and lacks the background color setting

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both want to create the same `LinkText` widget with identical parameters
2. HEAD additionally wants to set the background color to match the parent

Since the HEAD version includes the additional background color setting (which is likely intentional for UI consistency) and the only other difference is formatting style, I'll preserve the HEAD version as it has more functionality:

```python
            if isinstance(self, LibraryDetails) and not self.torrent.swift_hash:
                vSizer.Add(self.listCtrl, 1, wx.EXPAND | wx.LEFT)
                vSizer.Add(wx.StaticLine(parent, -1, style=wx.LI_HORIZONTAL), 0, wx.EXPAND | wx.ALL, 3)
                ulfont = self.GetFont()
                ulfont.SetUnderlined(True)
                self.filesFooter = LinkText(parent, 'Click here to modify which files should be downloaded.', fonts = [self.GetFont(), ulfont], colours = [self.GetForegroundColour(), wx.RED])
                self.filesFooter.SetBackgroundColour(parent.GetBackgroundColour())
                self.filesFooter.Bind(wx.EVT_LEFT_UP, self.OnChangeSelection)
                vSizer.Add(self.filesFooter, 0, wx.EXPAND | wx.ALL, 3)
            else:
                vSizer.Add(self.listCtrl, 1, wx.EXPAND | wx.LEFT)
            parent.SetSizer(vSizer)

```
