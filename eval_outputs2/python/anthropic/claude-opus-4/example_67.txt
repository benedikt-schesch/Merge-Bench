Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - raising a `RangeInvalid` exception with the same message. The only difference is formatting:

- HEAD version has the code split across two lines
- The incoming change has it on a single line

Since both versions are semantically identical and the single-line version is more concise and follows common Python style guidelines for short statements, I'll resolve this by using the single-line version:

```python
>>>>>>> 1fcf849f16279d43010c89c5d8cf69d5de96a800
            return v

        # Objects that have no length e.g. None or strings will raise TypeError
        except TypeError:
            raise RangeInvalid(self.msg or 'invalid value or type')

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Length(min=%s, max=%s)' % (self.min, self.max)



```
