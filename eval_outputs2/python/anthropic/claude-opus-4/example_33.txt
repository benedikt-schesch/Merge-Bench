Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they both want to document the test function with a docstring. The only difference is:

- HEAD version: Has spaces after and before the triple quotes: `""" Test with invalid None email address """`
- Other version: No spaces after opening quotes or before closing quotes: `"""Test with invalid None email address"""`

The second version (without extra spaces) follows the more common Python docstring convention as recommended by PEP 257. Since both sides have the same intent (adding a docstring to describe the test), I'll resolve this by using the more conventional format.

```python

    assert 'example@example.com"', out_.get("url")


def test_email_validation_with_none():
    """Test with invalid None email address"""
    schema = Schema({"email": Email()})
    with pytest.raises(
        MultipleInvalid,
        match=r"expected an email address for dictionary value @ data\['email'\]",
    ) as ctx:
