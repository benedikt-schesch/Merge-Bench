Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add setter methods to what appears to be a search or query class. The HEAD branch is adding a method to set a start index (likely for pagination), while the other branch is adding a method to set sorting by date.

These two additions are not conflicting in terms of functionality - they serve different purposes and can coexist. The conflict is purely positional, as both changes are trying to add methods at the same location in the file.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
        self.include_citations = yesorno

    def set_include_patents(self, yesorno):
        self.include_patents = yesorno

    def set_start_index(self, index):
        self.start = index

    def set_sort_by_date(self, yesorno):
        self.sort_by_date = yesorno

    def get_url(self):
        if self.words is None and self.words_some is None \
           and self.words_none is None and self.phrase is None \
           and self.author is None and self.pub is None \

```
