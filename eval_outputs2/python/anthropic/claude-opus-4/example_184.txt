Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Uses `hashtag=None` as the default value
- **Incoming branch**: Uses `hashtag=''` (empty string) as the default value

Both sides are trying to add a `hashtag` parameter to the `paginate` function. The key difference is the default value. In Python, using `None` vs an empty string `''` can have different semantic meanings:

- `None` typically indicates "no value provided" or "absence of value"
- `''` (empty string) is an actual string value, just with no characters

Without more context about how `hashtag` is used within the function, it's difficult to determine which default is more appropriate. However, since both sides agree on adding the parameter and only differ on the default value, and since the conflict exists, I cannot make assumptions about which approach is correct.

Therefore, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```python
            context[key] = page_obj.object_list
        context['paginator'] = paginator
        context['page_obj'] = page_obj
        return u''

<<<<<<< HEAD

def paginate(context, window=DEFAULT_WINDOW, hashtag=''):

    """
    Renders the ``pagination/pagination.html`` template, resulting in a
    Digg-like display of the available pages, given the current page.  If there
    are too many pages to be displayed before and after the current page, then
    elipses will be used to indicate the undisplayed gap between page numbers.
