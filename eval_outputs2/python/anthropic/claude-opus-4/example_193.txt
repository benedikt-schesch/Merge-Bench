Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

**HEAD (current branch)**: Adds a logger initialization using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`

**Incoming changes**: Adds two new settings configurations:
- `CONTEXT_FUNCTION` for setting up context
- `ALLOW_OPENID_SIGNUPS` for controlling OpenID signups

Both sides are adding different functionality that doesn't conflict semantically - one is adding logging capability while the other is adding configuration settings. These changes are complementary and should both be included.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
    'socialregistration.forms.UserForm')

INITAL_DATA_FUNCTION = getattr(settings, 'SOCIALREGISTRATION_INITIAL_DATA_FUNCTION',
    None)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

CONTEXT_FUNCTION = getattr(settings, 'SOCIALREGISTRATION_SETUP_CONTEXT_FUNCTION',
    None)

ALLOW_OPENID_SIGNUPS = getattr(settings, 'SOCIALREGISTRATION_ALLOW_OPENID_SIGNUPS',
    True)

class Setup(SocialRegistration, View):
    """
    Setup view to create new Django users from third party APIs.
    """

```
