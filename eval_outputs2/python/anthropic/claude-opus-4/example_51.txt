Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to fix the same issue - adding a space after the opening triple quotes in the docstring to follow PEP 257 conventions. The only difference is:

- HEAD version: `""" Test with Number...`
- Other version: `"""Test with Number...`

The HEAD version has a space after the quotes, which is the correct format according to PEP 257. Since both changes have the same intent (fixing the docstring format) and HEAD already has the correct format, I'll resolve by keeping the HEAD version.

```python
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise Invalid for String"


def test_number_validation_with_valid_precision_scale_yield_decimal_false():
    """ Test with Number with valid precision, scale and no yield_decimal"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(precision=6, scale=2, yield_decimal=False)})
    out_ = schema({"number": '1234.00'})
    assert out_.get("number") == '1234.00'



```
