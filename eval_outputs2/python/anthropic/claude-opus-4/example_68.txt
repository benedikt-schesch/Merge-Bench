Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - defining the `__init__` method with the same parameters and type hints. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD keeps it on a single line
- The incoming change splits it across multiple lines for better readability

Since both versions are semantically identical and the incoming change follows a common Python style convention for long function signatures (splitting parameters across lines when they get too long), I'll resolve this by accepting the incoming change which has better formatting:

```python
class Datetime(object):
    """Validate that the value matches the datetime format."""

    DEFAULT_FORMAT = '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'

    def __init__(
        self, format: typing.Optional[str] = None, msg: typing.Optional[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        self.format = format or self.DEFAULT_FORMAT
        self.msg = msg

    def __call__(self, v):
        try:

```
