Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to fix the same issue - they're both correcting the docstring format. The only difference is:

- HEAD version: Uses a space after the opening quotes (`""" Test`)
- Incoming version: No space after the opening quotes (`"""Test`)

The Python convention (PEP 257) recommends starting the docstring text immediately after the opening quotes without a space. Therefore, the incoming change is the correct one.

```python
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise Invalid for String"


def test_number_when_valid_precision_n_scale_none_yield_decimal_true():
    """Test with Number with no precision and valid scale"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(precision=14, yield_decimal=True)})
    out_ = schema({"number": '1234567.8901234'})
    assert float(out_.get("number")) == 1234567.8901234



```
