Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the same docstring. The only difference is:
- HEAD version: has a space after the opening triple quotes
- Incoming version: has no space after the opening triple quotes

The semantic intent is the same - both are documenting a test function. The incoming version follows the more common Python docstring convention of not having a space after the opening quotes.

Here's the resolved version:

```python
    out_ = schema({"number": '123456789.34'})
    assert float(out_.get("number")) == 123456789.34


def test_number_when_precision_none_n_valid_scale_case2_yield_decimal_true():
    """Test with Number with no precision and valid scale case 2 with zero in decimal part"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(scale=2, yield_decimal=True)})
    out_ = schema({"number": '123456789012.00'})
    assert float(out_.get("number")) == 123456789012.00



```
