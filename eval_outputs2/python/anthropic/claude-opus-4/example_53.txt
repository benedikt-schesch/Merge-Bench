Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they're asserting that the inferred schema matches an expected Schema object with a Required 'list' key containing a list of types [str, bool, int, float].

The only difference is formatting:
- HEAD version uses multi-line formatting with proper indentation
- The other version uses single-line formatting

Since both versions are semantically identical and the difference is purely stylistic, I'll preserve the HEAD version as it follows better Python formatting practices with proper indentation for readability.

```python


def test_schema_infer_list():
    schema = Schema.infer({'list': ['foo', True, 42, 3.14]})

    assert schema == Schema({
        Required('list'): [str, bool, int, float]
    })


def test_schema_infer_scalar():
    assert Schema.infer('foo') == Schema(str)
    assert Schema.infer(True) == Schema(bool)

```
