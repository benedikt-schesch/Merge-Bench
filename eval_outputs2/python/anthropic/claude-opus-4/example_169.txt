Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the import of MD5 hashing functionality with fallback support for older Python versions.

The HEAD side is creating a simple alias `hashFactory = hashlib.md5`, while the incoming changes are creating a wrapper function `new()` and also extracting the `digest_size`.

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to provide MD5 hashing capability
- Both sides want to handle the ImportError fallback to the deprecated `md5` module
- The incoming changes provide a more complete interface with a `new()` function and `digest_size` attribute

Here's the resolved conflict that preserves both intents:

```python

try:
    # The md5 module is deprecated in Python 2.6, so use hashlib when possible.
    import hashlib
    hashFactory = hashlib.md5

    def new(data=b("")):
         return hashlib.md5(data)
    digest_size = new().digest_size

except ImportError:
    import md5
    hashFactory = md5

```
