Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the `AddButton` method, but with different signatures:

- HEAD version: `def AddButton(self, label, handler, right_spacer = 10):`
- Other branch: `def AddButton(self, label, handler):`

The HEAD version includes an additional parameter `right_spacer` with a default value of 10, while the other branch has the simpler signature without this parameter.

Since the `right_spacer` parameter has a default value, the HEAD version is backward compatible with any code expecting the simpler signature. The semantic intent appears to be adding functionality (the spacing feature) while maintaining compatibility.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
        self.hide_buttons = True
        self.AddButtons()

    def AddButtons(self):
        pass
        
    def AddButton(self, label, handler, right_spacer = 10):
        if handler == None or label == None:
            return

        button = ProgressButton(self, -1, label)
        button.Bind(wx.EVT_LEFT_UP, handler)

```
