Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (the branch being merged in) is trying to add `import sys` and two blank lines before the `rldecode` function, while HEAD has no imports before the function.

Since this is a simple import statement addition and doesn't appear to conflict with the intent of either side, I'll resolve this by accepting the import.
