Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add import statements but for different purposes:

- HEAD (current branch) wants to import `warnings` and `threading`
- The incoming branch wants to import `logging`

Since these imports serve different purposes and don't conflict with each other semantically, the best resolution is to keep all three imports. They appear to be adding different functionality to the codebase.

```python

# bitcointools -- modified deserialize.py to return raw transaction
import BCDataStream
import deserialize
import util
import warnings
import threading
import logging

SCHEMA_VERSION = "Abe29"

CONFIG_DEFAULTS = {
    "dbtype":       None,

```
