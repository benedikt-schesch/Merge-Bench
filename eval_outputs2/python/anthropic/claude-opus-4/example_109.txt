Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different parameters to the `urlargs` dictionary. The HEAD branch is adding a 'start' parameter while the other branch is adding a 'sortby' parameter. These appear to be independent additions that don't conflict semantically - they're just adding different URL arguments.

The semantic intent is to include both parameters in the final dictionary, so the resolution should keep both additions.

```python
                   'pub': self.pub or '',
                   'ylo': self.timeframe[0] or '',
                   'yhi': self.timeframe[1] or '',
                   'patents': '0' if self.include_patents else '1',
                   'citations': '0' if self.include_citations else '1',
                   'start': self.start or '0',
                   'sortby': '1' if self.sort_by_date else '0'}

        for key, val in urlargs.items():
            urlargs[key] = quote(encode(val))

        # The following URL arguments must not be quoted, or the
