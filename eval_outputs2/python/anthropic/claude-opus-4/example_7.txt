Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add a button to the `buttonSizer` with the same alignment flags (`wx.ALIGN_CENTER_VERTICAL | wx.RIGHT`), but they differ in the spacing value:

- HEAD version uses a variable `right_spacer` for the spacing
- The incoming change uses a hardcoded value of `10`

The HEAD version appears more flexible as it uses a variable that could be configured elsewhere, while the incoming change seems to be trying to standardize the spacing. Without more context about whether `right_spacer` is defined and what its value should be, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict.

Here's the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```python
            return

        button = ProgressButton(self, -1, label)
        button.Bind(wx.EVT_LEFT_UP, handler)
        self.AddEvents(button)
<<<<<<< HEAD
        self.buttonSizer.Add(button, 0, wx.ALIGN_CENTER_VERTICAL|wx.RIGHT, right_spacer)
=======
        self.buttonSizer.Add(button, 0, wx.ALIGN_CENTER_VERTICAL | wx.RIGHT, 10)
>>>>>>> d523b6a054acb6d09befd78a9bc3897d48454bcd
        self.Layout()
        self.ShowSelected()
        return button

    def ShowSelected(self):
