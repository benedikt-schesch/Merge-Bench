Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- HEAD: Simply imports `typing`
- The other branch (1fcf849): Also imports `typing` but wraps it with `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` comments

The `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` comments are typically used to disable and re-enable code formatters (like Black) for specific sections of code. In this case, it seems someone wanted to prevent the formatter from modifying the import statement.

Since both sides want to import `typing` and the only difference is the formatting control comments, I'll preserve the formatting control from the incoming branch as it represents an intentional decision to control formatting for this import.

```python
# fmt: off
import typing

# fmt: on


class Error(Exception):
    """Base validation exception."""
