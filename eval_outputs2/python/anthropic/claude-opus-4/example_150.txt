Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar goals with some differences:

**HEAD (left side):**
- Uses Python 3 print syntax with parentheses: `print(s)`
- Doesn't set a `tests_pass` variable

**Right side:**
- Adds logic to track if tests pass: sets `tests_pass = False` if there are any fails
- Uses Python 2 print syntax without parentheses: `print s`

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to print the test results
2. The right side also wants to track whether all tests passed

To resolve this conflict, I'll combine both intents using Python 3 syntax:

```python
        if f_name.endswith(".py"):
            path = os.path.join(completion_test_dir, f_name)
            f = open(path)
            num_tests, fails = completion_test(f.read())
            s = 'run %s tests with %s fails (%s)' % (num_tests, fails, f_name)
            if fails:
                tests_pass = False
            print(s)
            summary.append(s)

print('\nSummary:')
for s in summary:
