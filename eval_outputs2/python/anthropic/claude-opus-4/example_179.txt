Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has several TODO items that were added, while the other branch (79a9afb1b0f254e0dcc85d6ac2344decbdc00d9b) appears to have removed or not included these items.

From a semantic perspective, TODO lists are typically meant to be additive - items are added as new tasks are identified. The HEAD branch has more detailed planning items that seem valuable to preserve. The empty line with just a dash suggests someone was in the middle of adding another TODO item.

Here's the resolved conflict, preserving the more complete TODO list from HEAD:

```python

    TODO:
        - local installation (without setup.py, package install)
        - add option --debug for compile
        - add option --profile for compile
        - debug to verbose
        - add quete
        - delete --with-npm, add --without-npm
        - save command line at creation
        - 
        - add setup.py
