Looking at this merge conflict, I can see two different changes being made to the same test file:

1. **HEAD (current branch)**: Adds an assertion to verify that `caching.make_key()` returns a specific hash value ('b83d174032efa27bf1c9ce1db19fa6ec')
2. **Incoming branch**: Simplifies the test to just verify that the function doesn't crash with a unicode error, and also adds a completely new test method `test_get_flush_lists_none`

Both changes appear to be valid and serve different purposes:
- The HEAD version is testing for a specific expected output
- The incoming version is testing for crash resilience and adds additional test coverage

Since both intents are valuable and compatible, I'll merge them by keeping the assertion from HEAD and adding the new test method from the incoming branch:

```python
        eq_([a.val for a in u.addon_set.all()], [42, 17])

    def test_make_key_unicode(self):
        translation.activate(u'en-US')
        f = 'fragment\xe9\x9b\xbb\xe8\x85\xa6\xe7\x8e'
        eq_(caching.make_key(f, with_locale=True),
            'b83d174032efa27bf1c9ce1db19fa6ec')
        translation.deactivate()

    @mock.patch('caching.invalidation.cache.get_many')
    def test_get_flush_lists_none(self, cache_mock):
        if not getattr(settings, 'CACHE_MACHINE_USE_REDIS', False):
            cache_mock.return_value.values.return_value = [None, [1]]
            eq_(caching.invalidator.get_flush_lists(None), set([1]))
```
