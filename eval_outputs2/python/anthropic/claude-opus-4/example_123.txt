Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the same code but with slightly different changes:

- HEAD version: Adds a number format pattern without the `u` prefix and ends with a closing parenthesis
- The other branch: Adds the same number format pattern with a `u` prefix (Unicode string literal) and also adds a `mobile_number_portable_region=True` parameter

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to add the same number format pattern
2. The other branch also wants to add the `mobile_number_portable_region` parameter
3. The `u` prefix difference is likely just a Python 2/3 compatibility issue

Since both sides want the number format pattern and the second branch has an additional valid parameter, the resolution should include both changes. The `u` prefix is not necessary in Python 3 (strings are Unicode by default) but doesn't hurt either.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
    voip=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    pager=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    uan=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    voicemail=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    no_international_dialling=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    number_format=[NumberFormat(pattern='(\\d{4})(\\d{4})', format='\\1 \\2')],
    mobile_number_portable_region=True)

```
