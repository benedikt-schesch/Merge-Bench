Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to add a new configuration option to what appears to be a dictionary of settings. The HEAD branch wants to add `"no_update": None,` while the other branch wants to add `"logging": None,`.

Since these are two different configuration options that don't conflict semantically (one appears to control updates, the other logging), the appropriate resolution is to include both options.

```python
        "document_root":None,
        "auto_agpl":    None,
        "download_name":None,
        "watch_pid":    None,
        "base_url":     None,
        "no_update":    None,
        "logging":      None,

        "template":     DEFAULT_TEMPLATE,
        "template_vars": {
            "ABE_URL": ABE_URL,
            "APPNAME": ABE_APPNAME,

```
