Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle a circular dependency issue during the generation process. The key differences are:

1. **HEAD** uses `prnt()` function and includes "buildgeocodingdata.py" in the condition
2. **The other branch** uses `print >> sys.stderr` syntax and includes "buildprefixdata.py" in the condition
3. **HEAD** uses `u('United States')` while the other branch uses `u'United States'`

The semantic intent of both sides is to:
- Check if the script being run is one of the build/generation scripts
- If so, print a warning message and provide stub data
- If not, re-raise the exception

To resolve this conflict, I'll merge both conditions (include all three build scripts) and use the more modern Python syntax from HEAD:

```python
    # The generation process imports this module, creating a circular
    # dependency.  The hack below works around this.
    import os
    import sys
    if (os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildmetadatafromxml.py" or
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildgeocodingdata.py" or
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildprefixdata.py"):
        prnt("Failed to import generated data (but OK as during autogeneration)", file=sys.stderr)
        GEOCODE_DATA = {'1': {'en': u('United States')}}
        GEOCODE_LONGEST_PREFIX = 1
        LOCALE_DATA = {'US': {'en': u('United States')}}
    else:
        raise


```
