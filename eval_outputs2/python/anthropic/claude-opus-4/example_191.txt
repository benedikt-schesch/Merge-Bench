Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (local)**: Introduces a `process_as_code` variable and an `if` condition to control when code processing should happen
- **bbeee06f (remote)**: Removes the intermediate variable and directly processes the code

The semantic intent appears to be that HEAD was trying to add some conditional logic for when to process code, while the remote branch simplified the logic by removing this condition.

Since the remote branch represents a simplification and the `process_as_code` variable is set to `True` unconditionally in the HEAD version, the semantic intent of both changes is compatible - they both want to process the code in this branch. The remote version is cleaner as it avoids the unnecessary variable.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```python
                save(docs_text, code_text)
                has_code = docs_text = code_text = ''
            docs_text += re.sub(comment_matcher, "", line) + "\n"

        else:
            if code_text and any(line.lstrip().startswith(x)
                                 for x in ['class ', 'def ', '@']):
                if not code_text.lstrip().startswith("@"):
                    save(docs_text, code_text)
                    code_text = has_code = docs_text = ''

```
