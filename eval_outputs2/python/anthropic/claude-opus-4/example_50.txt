Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic result - they're asserting that the error message equals a specific string. The only difference is formatting:

- HEAD has the assertion on a single line
- The incoming change splits it across multiple lines for better readability

Since both versions are semantically identical and the incoming change appears to be a formatting improvement for readability (which is common in Python style guides when lines get long), I'll resolve this by keeping the incoming change's multi-line format:

```python
>>>>>>> 1fcf849f16279d43010c89c5d8cf69d5de96a800
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(precision=14, yield_decimal=True)})
    try:
        schema({"number": '12345674.8901234'})
    except MultipleInvalid as e:
        assert (
            str(e)
            == "Precision must be equal to 14 for dictionary value @ data['number']"
        )
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise Invalid for String"
