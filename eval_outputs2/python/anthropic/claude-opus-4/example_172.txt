Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add import statements after the distutils imports. The HEAD side adds `distutils`, `tempfile`, and `os, sys`, while the other branch adds `os, sys, re` with a blank line before it.

Since both sides want to import `os, sys`, and each side has additional imports that don't conflict with each other, the semantic intent is to include all the necessary imports. The blank line from the second branch appears to be a stylistic choice to separate the distutils imports from the standard library imports.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
from distutils import core
from distutils.ccompiler import new_compiler
from distutils.core import Extension, Command
from distutils.command.build import build
from distutils.command.build_ext import build_ext
import distutils

import tempfile
import os, sys, re
import struct

if sys.version[0:1] == '1':
    raise RuntimeError ("The Python Cryptography Toolkit requires "
                         "Python 2.x or 3.x to build.")

```
