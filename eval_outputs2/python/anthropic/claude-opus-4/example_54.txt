Looking at this code, I can see this is a test function that's testing schema validation for sets. The merge conflict shows two different approaches to asserting the error handling:

- The HEAD version uses a try-except block with an assertion on the error message
- The incoming version uses pytest's context manager and asserts on the number of errors

However, there's a problem: the code already uses `pytest.raises` as a context manager (with the `with` statement), so the HEAD version's try-except approach doesn't make sense in this context. The incoming version correctly uses the context manager variable `ctx` to make assertions about the exception.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
    schema(set())
    schema(set([42]))
    schema(set([42, 43, 44]))
    with pytest.raises(MultipleInvalid, match="invalid value in set") as ctx:
        schema(set(['abc']))
    assert len(ctx.value.errors) == 1


def test_frozenset_of_integers():
    schema = Schema(frozenset([int]))
    with raises(Invalid, 'expected a frozenset'):
```
