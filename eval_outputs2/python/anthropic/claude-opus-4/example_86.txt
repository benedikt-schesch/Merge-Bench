Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Imports `datetime`, `time`, and `b64encode` from base64
- **Incoming change** (7c5e11da...): Only imports `datetime`

Since this is a backend implementation file (RedisBackend), both sides likely need the basic imports. The HEAD version seems to be adding additional functionality that requires `time` and `b64encode`, while the incoming change is more minimal.

Without seeing the rest of the implementation, it's difficult to know if `time` and `b64encode` are actually needed. Since the intent is ambiguous and I cannot determine whether the additional imports in HEAD are required for the RedisBackend implementation, I'll return the conflict as-is:

```python
<<<<<<< HEAD
import datetime, time
from base64 import b64encode

=======
import datetime
>>>>>>> 7c5e11da51608646c0dc8d70f8fff39ba19b0a75
from base import BaseBackend
from pyres import ResQ

class RedisBackend(BaseBackend):
    """Extends the ``BaseBackend`` to provide a Redis backend for failed jobs."""

```
