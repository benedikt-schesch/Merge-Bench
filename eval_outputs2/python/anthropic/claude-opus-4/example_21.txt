Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they're both defining the `extend` method with the same parameters. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD has the method signature on a single line
- The incoming change has the method signature split across multiple lines for better readability

Since both versions are functionally identical and the multi-line format is generally preferred for methods with multiple parameters (following Python style guidelines for readability), I'll resolve this by keeping the more readable multi-line version:

```python

            return data

        return validate_set

    def extend(
        self,
        schema: Schemable,
        required: typing.Optional[bool] = None,
        extra: typing.Optional[int] = None,
    ) -> Schema:
        """Create a new `Schema` by merging this and the provided `schema`.

        Neither this `Schema` nor the provided `schema` are modified. The
        resulting `Schema` inherits the `required` and `extra` parameters of
        this, unless overridden.

```
