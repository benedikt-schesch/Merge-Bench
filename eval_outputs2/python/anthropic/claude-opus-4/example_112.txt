Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the `__init__` method signature of what appears to be a class. 

The HEAD version wants a simple parameterless `__init__` method, while the incoming changes want to add several optional parameters with default values (`author='', scholar_url=None, count=0, bycluster=False`).

Since the incoming version with parameters is backwards compatible (all parameters have defaults, so it can still be called without arguments like the HEAD version), and it appears to add functionality that the other branch wants to introduce, the semantic intent seems to be to enhance the initialization capabilities while maintaining backwards compatibility.

Here's the resolved version:

```python
            self.querier = querier

        def handle_article(self, art):
            self.querier.add_article(art)

    def __init__(self, author='', scholar_url=None, count=0, bycluster=False):
        self.articles = []
        self.query = None
        self.cjar = MozillaCookieJar()


```
