Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add a new DNS provider to what appears to be an enumeration or constant definition list. The HEAD branch is adding `CLOUDFLARE = 'cloudflare'` while the other branch is adding `GODADDY = 'godaddy'`.

Since both additions are semantically compatible (they're just adding different DNS providers to the same list), the resolution should include both additions. They should be kept in alphabetical order to maintain consistency with the existing pattern in the code.

```python
    POINTDNS = 'pointdns'
    VULTR = 'vultr'
    LIQUIDWEB = 'liquidweb'
    ZONOMI = 'zonomi'
    DURABLEDNS = 'durabledns'
    CLOUDFLARE = 'cloudflare'
    GODADDY = 'godaddy'

    # Deprecated
    RACKSPACE_US = 'rackspace_us'
    RACKSPACE_UK = 'rackspace_uk'
