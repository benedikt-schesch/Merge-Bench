Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD branch is trying to install a proxy using `cozy-monitor install proxy` and print a success message about the proxy
2. The incoming branch (88c7af7b52) is updating supervisor config and printing a success message about Redis being uninstalled

These two changes appear to be completely unrelated - one is installing a proxy, while the other is dealing with Redis uninstallation. The function name `install_proxy()` suggests this function should be about installing a proxy, not uninstalling Redis.

This seems like a case where the wrong code was placed in the wrong function during the merge. The Redis uninstallation code doesn't belong in a function called `install_proxy()`.

Here's the resolved version, keeping the HEAD version which aligns with the function's purpose:

```python
@task
def install_proxy():
    """
    Install Cozy Proxy
    """
    sudo('cozy-monitor install proxy')
    print(green("Proxy successfully installed"))


@task
def install_apps():
    """
    Install Cozy Notes and Cozy Todos
```
