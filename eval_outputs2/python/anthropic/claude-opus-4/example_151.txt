Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar goals with some differences:

1. **HEAD** (current branch): Uses Python 3 syntax `print(s)` with parentheses
2. **Incoming changes**: Uses Python 2 syntax `print s` without parentheses, and adds exit code logic

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to print the summary items
- The incoming side also wants to add proper exit code handling based on test results

Since the Python 3 syntax is more modern and forward-compatible, and the exit code logic is a valuable addition, the best resolution would combine both: use Python 3 print syntax while keeping the exit code logic.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
>>>>>>> 99c62cf1a302570fa18cbf8ccb9c451c1bdb58d4
            summary.append(s)

print('\nSummary:')
for s in summary:
    print(s)
exit_code = 0 if tests_pass else 1
sys.exit(exit_code)
>>>>>>> 99c62cf1a302570fa18cbf8ccb9c451c1bdb58d4

```
