Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to set the jump speed when the spacebar is pressed, but with slightly different values:
- HEAD wants to set `self.dy = 0.015`
- The incoming change wants to set `self.dy = 0.016`

Since both changes have the same intent (setting the jump speed) and the difference is minimal (0.015 vs 0.016), I'll need to choose one value. Without additional context about which value is preferred or why the change was made, I'll keep the more recent change (0.016) as it likely represents an intentional adjustment to the jump speed.

```python
            self.strafe[1] -= 1
        elif symbol == key.D:
            self.strafe[1] += 1
        elif symbol == key.SPACE:
            if self.dy == 0:
                self.dy = 0.016 # jump speed
        elif symbol == key.ESCAPE:
            self.set_exclusive_mouse(False)
        elif symbol == key.TAB:
            self.flying = not self.flying
        elif symbol in self.num_keys:
