Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic result - they're both returning a list comprehension that finds workers. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD version has the list comprehension split across two lines
- The other version has it on a single line

Since the semantic intent is identical and this is purely a formatting difference, I'll preserve the HEAD version's formatting as it's more readable for longer expressions.

```python
        if isinstance(host,basestring):
            resq = ResQ(host)
        elif isinstance(host, ResQ):
            resq = host

        return [Worker.find(w,resq)
                for w in resq.redis.smembers('resque:workers') or []]

    @classmethod
    def working(cls, host):
        if isinstance(host, basestring):
            resq = ResQ(host)

```
