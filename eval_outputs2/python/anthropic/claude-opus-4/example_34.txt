Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version has removed a blank line that exists in the other branch (1fcf849f16279d43010c89c5d8cf69d5de96a800). 

Since this is just a whitespace difference and doesn't affect the semantic meaning or functionality of the code, I'll preserve the version without the blank line (HEAD version) as it's more concise:

```python
    assert extended.schema == {'a': {'b': str, 'c': float, 'e': int}, 'd': str}


def test_schema_extend_handles_schema_subclass():
    """Verify that Schema.extend handles a subclass of Schema"""
    class S(Schema):
        pass

    base = S({Required('a'): int})
    extension = {Optional('b'): str}

```
