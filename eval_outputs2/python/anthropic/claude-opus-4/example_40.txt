I need to analyze this merge conflict. Looking at the conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to document the same test function, but with a minor formatting difference:

- HEAD version: `""" Test with Number with invalid precision and scale"""`
- Other branch: `"""Test with Number with invalid precision and scale"""`

The only difference is the space after the opening triple quotes. The semantic intent is identical - both are documenting what the test function does.

Following PEP 257 (Python docstring conventions), the preferred format is without the space after the opening quotes. Therefore, I'll resolve this by choosing the version without the space.

```python
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise Invalid for String"


def test_number_validation_with_invalid_precision_invalid_scale():
    """Test with Number with invalid precision and scale"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(precision=6, scale=2)})
    try:
        schema({"number": '123456.712'})
    except MultipleInvalid as e:
