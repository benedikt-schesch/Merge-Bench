Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they both want to raise either the original error or an AnyInvalid exception with a custom message. The only difference is formatting/line breaks.

Both versions have identical logic:
1. If there's an error and self.msg is None, raise the original error
2. If there's an error and self.msg is not None, raise AnyInvalid with self.msg
3. If there's no error, raise AnyInvalid with either self.msg or a default message

The HEAD version splits the raise statements across multiple lines while the other version keeps them on single lines. Since the logic is identical, I'll choose the more compact version for consistency:

```python
            except Invalid as e:
                if error is None or len(e.path) > len(error.path):
                    error = e
        else:
            if error:
                raise error if self.msg is None else AnyInvalid(self.msg, path=path)
            raise AnyInvalid(self.msg or 'no valid value found', path=path)
