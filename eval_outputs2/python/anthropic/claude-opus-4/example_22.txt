Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to validate that both `self.schema` and `schema` are dictionaries, but with different approaches:

- HEAD uses `type()` checks and has two separate assertions
- The incoming change uses `isinstance()` checks in a single assertion with a more readable format

The incoming change is semantically superior because:
1. `isinstance()` is the preferred way to check types in Python (it handles inheritance properly)
2. It combines both checks into a single, cleaner assertion
3. It has better formatting for readability

Here's the resolved code:

```python
        :param schema: dictionary to extend this `Schema` with
        :param required: if set, overrides `required` of this `Schema`
        :param extra: if set, overrides `extra` of this `Schema`
        """

        assert isinstance(self.schema, dict) and isinstance(
            schema, dict
        ), 'Both schemas must be dictionary-based'

        result = self.schema.copy()

        # returns the key that may have been passed as an argument to Marker constructor
        def key_literal(key):

```
