Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to check if `schema` is a mapping type, but they're using different approaches:

- HEAD uses `_Mapping`
- The other branch uses `collections.abc.Mapping`

The intent is the same - to check if the schema is a mapping type. The difference is likely due to import style preferences or refactoring. Since `collections.abc.Mapping` is more explicit and follows Python's standard practice of using the abstract base classes from `collections.abc`, I'll resolve this by using the more explicit version.

```python
            return lambda p, v: self._compiled(p, v)
        elif hasattr(schema, "__voluptuous_compile__"):
            return schema.__voluptuous_compile__(self)
        if isinstance(schema, Object):
            return self._compile_object(schema)
        if isinstance(schema, collections.abc.Mapping):
            return self._compile_dict(schema)
        elif isinstance(schema, list):
            return self._compile_list(schema)
        elif isinstance(schema, tuple):
            return self._compile_tuple(schema)
```
