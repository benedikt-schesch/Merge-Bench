Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD version has additional error handling code with `except` and `else` blocks after the `with raises(Invalid):` statement
2. The other branch removed this additional error handling code

The `with raises(Invalid):` context manager from pytest already handles the assertion that `Invalid` is raised. The additional `except/else` blocks in HEAD are redundant because:
- If `Invalid` is raised, the `with raises(Invalid):` will pass
- If `Invalid` is not raised, the `with raises(Invalid):` will fail the test
- The `except/else` blocks would never actually execute within the context manager

The intent of both sides is to test that `Invalid` is raised when calling `schema([1, 2, 3])`. The cleaner approach is to use just the `with raises(Invalid):` statement without the redundant error handling.

Here's the resolved code:

```python

def test_exact_sequence():
    schema = Schema(ExactSequence([int, int]))
    with raises(Invalid):
        schema([1, 2, 3])
    assert schema([1, 2]) == [1, 2]


def test_required():
    """Verify that Required works."""

```
