Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - they want to check if the file type/suffix is either "afm" or "pfb". The main difference is:

- HEAD uses `font_type` variable and checks for "afm" or empty string ""
- The other branch uses `suffix` variable and checks for "afm" or "pfb"

The second approach (using `suffix` and checking for "pfb") appears more semantically correct because:
1. The code inside the block handles both AFM and PFB files
2. The inner condition specifically handles the "afm" case
3. The empty string check in HEAD seems less intentional than explicitly checking for "pfb"

Here's the resolved code:

```python
                                addMapping(fontName, bold, italic, fullFontName)

                    # Register "normal" name and the place holder for style
                    self.registerFont(fontName, [*fontAlias, fullFontName])

            elif suffix in {"afm", "pfb"}:
                if suffix == "afm":
                    afm = file.getNamedFile()
                    tfile = pisaFileObject(baseName + ".pfb", basepath=file.basepath)
                    pfb = tfile.getNamedFile()
                else:
                    pfb = file.getNamedFile()

```
