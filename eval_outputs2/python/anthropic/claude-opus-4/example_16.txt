Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Wants the `path` property to return `typing.List[str]`
- Incoming change: Wants the `path` property to return `typing.List[typing.Hashable]`

The semantic intent here appears to be about making the type annotation more flexible. `typing.Hashable` is a more general type than `str` - all strings are hashable, but not all hashable objects are strings. This suggests the incoming change is trying to support a broader range of path components (like integers, tuples, or other hashable types) rather than just strings.

Given that this appears to be an intentional generalization of the type to support more use cases, the appropriate resolution would be to accept the incoming change with `typing.List[typing.Hashable]`.

```python
    @property
    def msg(self) -> str:
        return self.errors[0].msg

    @property
    def path(self) -> typing.List[typing.Hashable]:
        return self.errors[0].path

    @property
    def error_message(self) -> str:
        return self.errors[0].error_message

```
