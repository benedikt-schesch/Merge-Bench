Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent with slight differences:

1. Both sides create a `PhoneNumber` object with the same parameters
2. Both sides check if the national number starts with "0" for the `italian_leading_zero` parameter
3. Both sides get an area description for the number

The differences are:
- HEAD uses `U_ZERO` constant vs the literal string `"0"`
- HEAD uses `_area_description_for_number()` vs `prefix_description_for_number()`

The second difference appears to be the more significant one - it seems like HEAD has refactored to use a private helper function `_area_description_for_number()` that likely wraps the `prefix_description_for_number()` call with the standard parameters.

Since both approaches achieve the same goal and the HEAD version appears to be a refactoring for cleaner code, I'll resolve in favor of HEAD's approach:

```python
            # before the national destination code, this should be removed before
            # geocoding.
            national_number = national_number[len(mobile_token):]
            copied_numobj = PhoneNumber(country_code=numobj.country_code,
                                        national_number=national_number,
                                        italian_leading_zero=national_number.startswith(U_ZERO))
            area_description = _area_description_for_number(copied_numobj, lang, script, region)
        else:
            area_description = prefix_description_for_number(GEOCODE_DATA, GEOCODE_LONGEST_PREFIX,
                                                             numobj, lang, script, region)
        if area_description != "":
            return area_description

```
