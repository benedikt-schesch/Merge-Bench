Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - they both have the same function signature with identical parameters and type hints. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD: Single-line format
- The other branch: Multi-line format with parameters spread across multiple lines

Since both versions are functionally identical and the conflict is purely about code style/formatting, I'll preserve the multi-line format as it's generally preferred for better readability when there are multiple parameters.

```python
    >>> validate = Schema(Match(re.compile(r'0x[A-F0-9]+', re.I)))
    >>> validate('0x123ef4')
    '0x123ef4'
    """

    def __init__(
        self, pattern: typing.Union[re.Pattern, str], msg: typing.Optional[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if isinstance(pattern, basestring):
            pattern = re.compile(pattern)
        self.pattern = pattern
        self.msg = msg


```
