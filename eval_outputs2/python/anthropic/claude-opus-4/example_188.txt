Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch added a `multi_string = False` variable initialization, while the other branch did not include this addition. 

Based on the context, this appears to be setting up variables to track state while parsing code for comments. The variable `multi_line` is already being initialized to track multi-line comments, and it seems the HEAD branch wanted to add similar tracking for multi-line strings (likely to avoid treating string contents as comments).

Since both sides seem to be working on the same parsing logic and the HEAD branch is adding what appears to be a necessary state variable for proper parsing, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```python
                "code_text": code
            })

    # Setup the variables to get ready to check for multiline comments
    multi_line = False
    multi_string = False
    multistart, multiend = language.get("multistart"), language.get("multiend")
    comment_matcher = language['comment_matcher']

    for line in lines:
