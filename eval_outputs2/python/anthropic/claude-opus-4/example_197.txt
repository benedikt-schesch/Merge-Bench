Looking at this merge conflict, both sides appear to be trying to achieve the same thing - they both want to remove a blank line after the `step = core.Step.from_string(STEP_WITH_MATRIX2)` statement. The HEAD version has already removed it, while the other branch (2d65e5aa9657af31aa7d57cebe2b436dcc36fa76) also wants to remove it.

Since both sides have the same intent (removing the blank line), the resolution is straightforward - we should keep the version without the blank line.

```python

def test_step_represent_matrix():
    "Step with a more suggestive representation for a matrix"

    step = core.Step.from_string(STEP_WITH_MATRIX2)
    assert_equals(
        step.represent_columns(),
    '      | a | a |\n'
    '      | 2 | a |\n'
    '      |   | 67|\n'

```
