Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

**HEAD (left side)**: Uses `vs.union(ws).groupByKey(numSplits, taskMemory).flatMap(dispatch)`
**Incoming (right side)**: Uses `self.cogroup(other, numSplits, taskMemory).flatMap(dispatch)`

This appears to be implementing some kind of join operation. The key difference is:
- HEAD uses a union of `vs` and `ws` followed by `groupByKey`
- The incoming change uses `cogroup` with `other`

Looking at the context, this seems to be part of a join implementation where:
- The `dispatch` function above processes grouped values from two datasets
- It yields tuples of `(k, (vv, ww))` for combinations of values from both sides

The `cogroup` operation is semantically more appropriate for this use case as it's specifically designed to group values from two RDDs by key, which is exactly what a join operation needs. The union+groupByKey approach would require additional logic to distinguish which values came from which RDD.

Given that this appears to be implementing a join operation (based on the cartesian product logic in dispatch), the `cogroup` approach is the correct semantic choice.

```python
            if not wbuf and 1 in keeps:
                wbuf.append(None)
            for vv in vbuf:
                for ww in wbuf:
                    yield (k, (vv, ww))
        return self.cogroup(other, numSplits, taskMemory).flatMap(dispatch)
    
    def collectAsMap(self):
        d = {}
        for v in self.ctx.runJob(self, lambda x:list(x)):
            d.update(dict(v))
        return d

```
