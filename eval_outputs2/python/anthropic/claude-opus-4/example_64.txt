Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they both have the exact same function signature with identical type annotations. The only difference is in the formatting:

- HEAD has the entire function definition on a single line
- The other branch has formatted it across multiple lines for better readability

Since both versions are semantically identical and the multi-line format is generally preferred for better readability (especially with type annotations), I'll resolve this by keeping the multi-line formatted version:

```python
    ...                       Replace('hello', 'goodbye')))
    >>> validate('you say hello')
    'I say goodbye'
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        pattern: typing.Union[re.Pattern, str],
        substitution: str,
        msg: typing.Optional[str] = None,
    ) -> None:
        if isinstance(pattern, basestring):
            pattern = re.compile(pattern)
        self.pattern = pattern
        self.substitution = substitution
        self.msg = msg

```
