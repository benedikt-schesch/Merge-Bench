Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD wants to include `Mapper` in the list
- The incoming change (9e1b8b0) wants to include `Matcher` in the list

Without more context about what these modules do and their relationship, I cannot determine if:
1. Both should be included
2. One is a rename of the other
3. They are mutually exclusive
4. One should replace the other

Since the intent is ambiguous and I don't have enough information to make a semantic decision about which module should be included (or if both should be), I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```python
        from plugin.modules.scheduler.main import Scheduler
        from plugin.modules.sessions.main import Sessions
        from plugin.modules.upgrade.main import Upgrade

        return [
<<<<<<< HEAD
            Mapper,
=======
            Matcher,
>>>>>>> 9e1b8b030574b1848af30316fe7d49e8b638b0c8
            Scheduler,
            Sessions,
            Upgrade
        ]
