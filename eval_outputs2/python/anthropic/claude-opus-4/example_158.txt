Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch): Sets version to '0.6.0-alpha'
- Incoming change: Sets version to '0.5.4'

This appears to be a version number conflict where:
- The HEAD branch has moved forward to an alpha version of 0.6.0 (indicating development of a new minor version)
- The incoming branch has version 0.5.4 (a stable release in the 0.5.x series)

Since HEAD represents a newer version (0.6.0-alpha > 0.5.4), and alpha versions typically come after stable releases when developing the next version, the semantic intent is to keep the newer version number.

```python

from pystache.init import parse, render, Renderer, TemplateSpec

__all__ = ['parse', 'render', 'Renderer', 'TemplateSpec']

__version__ = '0.6.0-alpha'  # Also change in setup.py.

```
