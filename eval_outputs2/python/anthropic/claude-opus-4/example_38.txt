Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to document the same issue reference, but with slightly different formatting:

- HEAD version: `""" https://github.com/alecthomas/voluptuous/pull/434 """`
- Incoming version: `"""https://github.com/alecthomas/voluptuous/pull/434"""`

The only difference is the presence of spaces after the opening triple quotes and before the closing triple quotes. Both versions have the same semantic intent - to reference pull request #434.

Following Python's PEP 257 conventions for docstrings, the more common style is to not have spaces between the triple quotes and the content for single-line docstrings. Therefore, I'll resolve this in favor of the incoming change:

```python
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise correct Invalid"


def test_schema_empty_dict_key():
    """https://github.com/alecthomas/voluptuous/pull/434"""
    s = Schema({'var': []})
    s({'var': []})

    try:
        s({'var': [123]})

```
