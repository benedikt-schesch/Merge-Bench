Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version number conflict in what appears to be a Python package for memory profiling. Both sides are trying to update the version number:

- HEAD has version '0.40'
- The other branch has version '0.41'

Since version numbers should increment and '0.41' is higher than '0.40', the semantic intent appears to be moving forward with the newer version. This is a common pattern in merge conflicts where different branches have incremented versions.

```python
"""Profile the memory usage of a Python program"""

# .. we'll use this to pass it to the child script ..
_CLEAN_GLOBALS = globals().copy()

__version__ = '0.41'

_CMD_USAGE = "python -m memory_profiler script_file.py"

import time
import sys

```
