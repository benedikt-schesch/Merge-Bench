Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - adding a new condition to the if statement and printing an error message. The differences are:

1. HEAD adds `buildgeocodingdata.py` to the condition
2. The other branch adds `buildprefixdata.py` to the condition
3. HEAD uses the `prnt()` function with `file=sys.stderr`
4. The other branch uses the older Python 2 style `print >>` syntax

Since both sides are adding different build scripts to the whitelist, and both serve the same purpose (allowing certain build scripts to bypass the import error), the semantic merge should include both conditions. For the print statement, I'll use the more modern syntax from HEAD as it's Python 3 compatible.

```python
    # The generation process imports this module, creating a circular
    # dependency.  The hack below works around this.
    import os
    import sys
    if (os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildmetadatafromxml.py" or
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildgeocodingdata.py" or
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildprefixdata.py"):
        prnt("Failed to import generated data (but OK as during autogeneration)", file=sys.stderr)
        _COUNTRY_CODE_TO_REGION_CODE = {1: ("US",)}
        _AVAILABLE_SHORT_REGION_CODES = []
    else:
        raise
