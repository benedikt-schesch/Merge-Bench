Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Has a single `NumberFormat` pattern for 9-digit numbers with leading digits '48|8[7-9]|9[08]'
- **Incoming changes**: Has three `NumberFormat` patterns:
  1. A 7-digit format for numbers starting with '2'
  2. The same 9-digit format as HEAD
  3. A new 9-digit format with different grouping (3-2-2-2) for the same leading digits

Both sides include the same base pattern, but the incoming changes add two additional formats. This appears to be an expansion of supported phone number formats for country code 359 (Bulgaria). The semantic intent of the incoming changes is to support more phone number format variations.

Since the incoming changes include everything from HEAD plus additional formats, the resolution should accept all the formats from the incoming changes:

```python
"""Auto-generated file, do not edit by hand. 359 metadata"""
from ..phonemetadata import NumberFormat

PHONE_ALT_FORMAT_359 = [NumberFormat(pattern='(\\d)(\\d{3})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})', format=u'\\1 \\2 \\3 \\4', leading_digits_pattern=['2']), NumberFormat(pattern='(\\d{3})(\\d{3})(\\d{3})', format=u'\\1 \\2 \\3', leading_digits_pattern=['48|8[7-9]|9[08]']), NumberFormat(pattern='(\\d{3})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})', format=u'\\1 \\2 \\3 \\4', leading_digits_pattern=['48|8[7-9]|9[08]'])]
