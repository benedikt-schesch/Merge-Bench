Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - adding a `disabled` attribute to the TextInput widget. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD version: inline dictionary on a single line
- Other version: multi-line dictionary format

Since both achieve the same semantic intent (disabling the input field) and this appears to be just a formatting preference, I'll preserve the more compact HEAD version as it's consistent with the style of the surrounding code (other attributes in the file appear to use inline formatting).

```python
        help_text=u'This is the standard text input',
    )
    disabled = forms.CharField(
        max_length=100,
        help_text=u'I am read only',
        widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'disabled': 'disabled'})
    )
    content = forms.ChoiceField(
        choices=(
            ("text", "Plain text"),
            ("html", "HTML"),

```
