Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Has a docstring with a GitHub reference for docopt
- The incoming branch (d17299ab8c628fe682a77ef288272b21bedbe1d3): Has no docstring, just starts with the imports

This appears to be a conflict where one side added documentation while the other side either removed it or never had it. Since the docstring provides useful information about where the project is hosted and doesn't conflict with the functionality of the code, the semantic intent seems to be to keep the documentation.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
"""`docopt` lives on `GitHub <https://github.com/docopt/docopt/>`_."""
from setuptools import setup

from docopt import __version__



```
