Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same result - they both have an empty line after the `del body[attr]` statement. The only difference is:

- HEAD has just a newline
- The other branch (14b7129fbedd11d532c255f64650a114ec619bff) has a newline with trailing spaces

Since trailing spaces are generally considered bad practice and don't serve any semantic purpose, the cleaner resolution would be to use the HEAD version without the trailing spaces.

Here's the resolved code:

```python

        #删除body的所有属性，以便InsertToc使用正则表达式匹配<body>
        bodyattrs = [attr for attr in body.attrs]
        for attr in bodyattrs:
            del body[attr]

        #将HTML5标签转换为div
        for x in soup.find_all(['article', 'aside', 'header', 'footer', 'nav',
            'figcaption', 'figure', 'section', 'time']):
            x.name = 'div'

```
