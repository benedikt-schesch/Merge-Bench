Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Wants to run tests using `unittest.TextTestRunner` with a specific test loader, then generate a coverage report and clean up a directory.
- **Incoming change**: Wants to simply use `unittest.main()` with verbosity=2, which is a more standard/simple way to run tests.

The conflict appears to be about how to run the tests. The HEAD version has additional functionality (coverage reporting and cleanup) that the incoming change doesn't have. Since both sides want to run tests with verbosity=2, and the HEAD version includes additional useful functionality (coverage report and cleanup), I'll preserve the HEAD version as it seems to have more complete intent.

```python
    import ivre.utils
    import ivre.mathutils
    import ivre.passive
    if not hasattr(IvreTests, "assertItemsEqual"):
        IvreTests.assertItemsEqual = IvreTests.assertCountEqual
    unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=2).run(
        unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromTestCase(IvreTests),
    )
    coverage_report()
    ivre.utils.cleandir("bin")

```
