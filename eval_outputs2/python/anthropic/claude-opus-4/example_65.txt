Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - raising a `RangeInvalid` exception with an error message. The only difference is:

- HEAD version: Has the closing parenthesis on the same line as the message string
- Other version: Has the closing parenthesis on a separate line

Since the conflict is purely about formatting/style and both versions are functionally identical, I'll resolve this by choosing the version that follows more common Python formatting conventions. Having the closing parenthesis on a separate line (as in the second version) is generally preferred for multi-line function calls as it makes the code more readable and easier to modify.

```python
            return v

        # Objects that lack a partial ordering, e.g. None or strings will raise TypeError
        except TypeError:
            raise RangeInvalid(
                self.msg or 'invalid value or type (must have a partial ordering)'
            )

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Range(min=%r, max=%r, min_included=%r, max_included=%r, msg=%r)' % (
            self.min,
            self.max,
```
