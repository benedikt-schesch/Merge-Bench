Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD version has one `NumberFormat` entry in the list
2. The incoming version (after `=======`) has two `NumberFormat` entries in the list
3. The first `NumberFormat` in both versions is identical except for the `u` prefix on the format string in the incoming version (which is Python 2 unicode syntax)
4. The incoming version adds a second `NumberFormat` entry

Since this appears to be an auto-generated file for phone number formatting metadata, the semantic intent seems to be:
- Both sides want to define phone number formatting rules
- The incoming version has additional formatting rules (a second pattern) that should be preserved
- The `u` prefix difference is likely due to Python 2/3 compatibility

The resolution should include both `NumberFormat` entries, and since Python 3 treats all strings as unicode by default, we can use the version without the `u` prefix:

```python
"""Auto-generated file, do not edit by hand. 31 metadata"""
from ..phonemetadata import NumberFormat

PHONE_ALT_FORMAT_31 = [NumberFormat(pattern='([1-578]\\d)(\\d{4})(\\d{3})', format='\\1 \\2 \\3', leading_digits_pattern=['1[035]|2[0346]|3[03568]|4[0356]|5[0358]|7|8[4578]']), NumberFormat(pattern='([1-5]\\d{2})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})', format='\\1 \\2 \\3 \\4', leading_digits_pattern=['1[16-8]|2[259]|3[124]|4[17-9]|5[124679]'])]
