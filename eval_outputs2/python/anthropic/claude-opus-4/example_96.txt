Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD (current branch) has an empty line
- The incoming branch (2a436ed59d63924bcbddff469cc95ca5640a4892) has a comment line with just "#"

Both sides seem to be trying to add some spacing/formatting before the jVectorMap version comment. The incoming branch adds a comment marker "#" while HEAD just has blank space. Since this appears to be a header comment block for jVectorMap, adding the "#" maintains consistency with the comment style that follows.

Here's the resolved version:

```python

# jVectorMap version 2.0.4
