Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are adding different query configuration options:

- HEAD is adding support for setting a start index (`options.start`)
- The other branch is adding support for sorting by date (`options.date`)

These two features are not mutually exclusive and both appear to be valid query configuration options. The semantic intent is to extend the query configuration capabilities, and both additions serve different purposes that can coexist.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```python
            query.set_timeframe(options.after, options.before)
        if options.no_patents:
            query.set_include_patents(False)
        if options.no_citations:
            query.set_include_citations(False)
        if options.start:
            query.set_start_index(options.start)
        if options.date:
            query.set_sort_by_date(True)

    if options.count is not None:
        options.count = min(options.count, ScholarConf.MAX_PAGE_RESULTS)
        query.set_num_page_results(options.count)
