Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to close a regex pattern definition, but they have slightly different formatting preferences:

- **HEAD**: Uses `re.IGNORECASE)` with the closing parenthesis on the same line
- **Branch (1fcf849f1...)**: Uses `re.IGNORECASE,` with a trailing comma, closing parenthesis on a new line, and includes a `# fmt: on` comment

The semantic intent is the same - both are trying to complete the regex pattern with the `re.IGNORECASE` flag. The branch version appears to be using Black formatter conventions (trailing comma and `# fmt: on` comment), which is a common Python code formatting tool.

Since the branch version follows more modern Python formatting practices and includes formatter directives, I'll resolve in favor of that version:

```python
    # literal form, ipv4 address (SMTP 4.1.3)
    r'|^\[(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d?\d)'
    r'(\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d?\d)){3}\]$'
    # end anchor, because fullmatch is not available in python 2.7
    r")\Z",
    re.IGNORECASE,
)
# fmt: on
