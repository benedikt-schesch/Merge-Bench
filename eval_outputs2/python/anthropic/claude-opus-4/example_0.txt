Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import different modules in the `discover` method:

- HEAD wants to import `Mapper` from `plugin.modules.mapper.main`
- The other branch wants to import `Matcher` from `plugin.modules.matcher.main`

Without additional context about the project's architecture and whether these are mutually exclusive modules or if both should be included, I cannot determine the correct resolution. The semantic intent is ambiguous - it's unclear if:
1. `Mapper` replaced `Matcher` (or vice versa)
2. Both modules should coexist
3. One is a rename of the other

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```python
    def initialize(cls):
        cls.modules = dict(cls.construct())

    @classmethod
    def discover(cls):
<<<<<<< HEAD
        from plugin.modules.mapper.main import Mapper
=======
        from plugin.modules.matcher.main import Matcher
>>>>>>> 9e1b8b030574b1848af30316fe7d49e8b638b0c8
        from plugin.modules.scheduler.main import Scheduler
        from plugin.modules.sessions.main import Sessions
        from plugin.modules.upgrade.main import Upgrade

        return [
