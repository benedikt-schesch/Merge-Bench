Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they're both asserting that the error message equals "Value must be a number enclosed with string for dictionary value @ data['number']".

The only difference is formatting:
- HEAD has it on a single line
- The incoming change has it split across multiple lines with proper formatting

Since both sides have the same semantic intent and the incoming change provides better code formatting (following Python style guidelines for long strings), I'll resolve by keeping the better-formatted version.

```python

    schema = Schema({"number": Number(precision=6, scale=2)})
    try:
        schema({"number": 'teststr'})
    except MultipleInvalid as e:
        assert (
            str(e)
            == "Value must be a number enclosed with string for dictionary value @ data['number']"
        )
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise Invalid for String"
