Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - they both have the same function signature with identical parameters and types. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD has the entire function definition on a single line
- The incoming change has formatted it across multiple lines for better readability

Since both versions are semantically identical and the multi-line format is generally preferred for better code readability (following PEP 8 style guidelines), I'll resolve this by choosing the formatted version:

```python
        REMOVE_EXTRA: 'REMOVE_EXTRA',
        ALLOW_EXTRA: 'ALLOW_EXTRA',
        PREVENT_EXTRA: 'PREVENT_EXTRA',
    }

    def __init__(
        self, schema: Schemable, required: bool = False, extra: int = PREVENT_EXTRA
    ) -> None:
        """Create a new Schema.

        :param schema: Validation schema. See :module:`voluptuous` for details.
        :param required: Keys defined in the schema must be in the data.
        :param extra: Specify how extra keys in the data are treated:
