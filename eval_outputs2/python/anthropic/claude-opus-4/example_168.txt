Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to construct an RSA key, but they're using different approaches:
- HEAD is using `self.rsa.construct()`
- The other branch is using `RSA.construct()`

Looking at the context, I can see that:
1. In the code before the conflict, `self.rsa.construct()` is being used
2. In the code after the conflict, `self.rsa.construct()` is also being used

This suggests that the codebase is consistently using `self.rsa` as the way to access the RSA module/class. The other branch's change to use `RSA.construct()` directly appears to be inconsistent with the rest of the code.

Therefore, the HEAD version should be kept to maintain consistency:

```python
        key = self.rsa.construct([self.n, self.e])
        derKey = key.exportKey("DER")
        self.assertEqual(derKey, self.rsaPublicKeyDER)

    def testExportKey3(self):
        key = self.rsa.construct([self.n, self.e, self.d, self.p, self.q, self.pInv])
        pemKey = key.exportKey("PEM")
        self.assertEqual(pemKey, b(self.rsaKeyPEM))

    def testExportKey4(self):
        key = self.rsa.construct([self.n, self.e])

```
