Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD version: includes `list, dict,` in the primitive types check
- Other version: excludes `list, dict,` from the primitive types check

The key insight is that this is a type checking condition that determines whether to call `_compile_scalar(schema)`. The presence of a separate `_compile_mapping` method suggests that `dict` (and likely `list`) have their own specialized compilation methods and shouldn't be treated as scalars.

The HEAD version appears to be incorrectly including `list` and `dict` as types that should be compiled as scalars, while the other version correctly excludes them. This makes semantic sense because lists and dicts are complex types that would need specialized handling, not scalar compilation.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
        elif isinstance(schema, (frozenset, set)):
            return self._compile_set(schema)
        type_ = type(schema)
        if inspect.isclass(schema):
            type_ = schema
        if type_ in (*primitive_types, object, type(None)) or callable(schema):
            return _compile_scalar(schema)
        raise er.SchemaError('unsupported schema data type %r' % type(schema).__name__)

    def _compile_mapping(self, schema, invalid_msg=None):
        """Create validator for given mapping."""

```
