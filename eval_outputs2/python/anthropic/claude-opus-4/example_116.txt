Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the version number of the package:

- HEAD (current branch) has version '3.98'
- The incoming branch has version '3.97'

From a semantic perspective, version 3.98 is a higher/newer version than 3.97. In typical version numbering schemes, we want to keep the higher version number to avoid regression. Since HEAD already has the higher version (3.98), we should keep that version.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
# your option) any later version.

from setuptools import setup

setup(name='bitmapist',
      version='3.98',
      author="amix",
      author_email="amix@amix.dk",
      url="http://www.amix.dk/",
      install_requires=[
          'redis>=2.10.0',
```
