Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to fix issues in the same exception message, but they're addressing different problems:

1. **HEAD** is trying to fix undefined variable names (`id` and `packetid` should be `self.packetid`)
2. **The incoming change** is trying to fix the same undefined variables but uses `pid` (which is defined) and `self.packetid`

The incoming change appears more correct because:
- `pid` is actually defined in the code (`rcmd, size, pid = unpack("III", h)`)
- `self.packetid` is the correct way to reference the packet id
- The incoming change is missing the `d = self.recv(size-4)` line that should come after the exception

The semantically correct resolution should use `pid` and `self.packetid` in the exception message AND include the `d = self.recv(size-4)` line.

```python
            raise r
        h, d = r
        rcmd, size, pid = unpack("III", h)
        if rcmd != cmd+1 or pid != self.packetid or size <= 4:
            self.close()
            raise Exception("incorrect answer (%s!=%s, %s!=%s, %d<=4", 
                rcmd, cmd+1, pid, self.packetid, size)
        d = self.recv(size-4)
        if len(d) == 1 and ord(d[0]) != 0:
            raise Error(ord(d[0]))
        return d
