Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same `__init__` method with identical parameters and type hints. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD has the method definition on a single line
- The other branch has the method definition spread across multiple lines for better readability

Since both versions are functionally identical and the multi-line format is generally preferred for methods with multiple parameters (following PEP 8 style guidelines), I'll resolve this by keeping the more readable multi-line version:

```python
    ['hourly_report', 10, [], []]
    >>> validate(('hourly_report', 10, [], []))
    ('hourly_report', 10, [], [])
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        validators: typing.Iterable[Schemable],
        msg: typing.Optional[str] = None,
        **kwargs,
    ) -> None:
        self.validators = validators
        self.msg = msg
        self._schemas = [Schema(val, **kwargs) for val in validators]

    def __call__(self, v):

```
