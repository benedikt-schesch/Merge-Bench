Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they both have the same assertion testing the `Capitalize` function with a UTF-8 decoded byte string. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD has the assertion on a single line
- The incoming change has the assertion split across multiple lines with a line break after `decode(`

Since both versions have identical logic and are testing the same thing, I'll preserve the more concise single-line format from HEAD for consistency with the other assertions in the test function.

```python


def test_capitalize_util_handles_various_inputs():
    assert Capitalize(3) == "3"
    assert Capitalize(u"3") == u"3"
    assert Capitalize(b'\xe2\x98\x83'.decode("UTF-8")) == b'\xe2\x98\x83'.decode("UTF-8")
    assert Capitalize(u"aaa aaa") == u"Aaa aaa"


def test_title_util_handles_various_inputs():
    assert Title(3) == "3"

```
