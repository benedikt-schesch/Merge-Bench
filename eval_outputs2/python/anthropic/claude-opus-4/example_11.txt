Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

1. HEAD has version "13.1" - this appears to be a minor version bump (from 13.0 to 13.1)
2. The other branch has version "13.0.1" - this appears to be a patch version (from 13.0 to 13.0.1)

Given that:
- The comment indicates this is used for release tagging
- `released = False` means we're in a development state after a release
- HEAD has a higher version number (13.1 > 13.0.1)
- In semantic versioning, minor versions include all patches from previous versions

The most logical resolution is to keep the higher version number (13.1) from HEAD, as it would naturally include any fixes that were in 13.0.1.

```python
# When tagging a release, set `released = True`.
# After tagging a release, set `released = False` and increment `tag`.

released = False

tag = version = commit = "13.1"


if not released:  # pragma: no cover
    import pathlib
    import re

```
