Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Has a clean version without the print statement
- **Incoming change**: Adds a print statement `print 'dini mueter, steile griech!'` which appears to be debug output in Swiss German

The print statement seems to be a debug/development artifact (likely translates to something informal/colloquial) that was probably added during debugging but shouldn't be in the final code. Since this appears to be debug output that was accidentally committed, the semantic intent is to have clean code without debug statements.

Here's the resolved version:

```python
def resolve_results(scopes):
    """ Here we follow the results - to get what we really want """
    result = []
    for s in scopes:
        if isinstance(s, parsing.Import):
            try:
                scope = follow_import(s)
                #for r in resolve_results([follow_import(s)]):
                #    if isinstance(r, parsing.Import):
                #        resolve_results(r)

```
