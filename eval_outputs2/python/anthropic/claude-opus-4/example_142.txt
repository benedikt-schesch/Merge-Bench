Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same `PHONE_ALT_FORMAT_62` variable with a `NumberFormat` object, but with slight differences:

1. **Pattern difference**: 
   - HEAD: `(\\d{2})(\\d{4})(\\d{4})` - expects exactly 4 digits in the second and third groups
   - Other branch: `(\\d{2})(\\d{3,4})(\\d{4})` - allows 3 or 4 digits in the second group

2. **Format string difference**:
   - HEAD: `'\\1 \\2'` - regular string
   - Other branch: `u'\\1 \\2'` - unicode string (Python 2 style)

The semantic intent appears to be updating the phone number pattern to be more flexible (allowing 3 or 4 digits in the middle group). The unicode prefix `u` is likely from Python 2/3 compatibility considerations, but in modern Python 3, it's not necessary as all strings are unicode by default.

The most sensible resolution would be to take the more flexible pattern from the other branch while using the modern string format from HEAD:

```python
"""Auto-generated file, do not edit by hand. 62 metadata"""
from ..phonemetadata import NumberFormat

PHONE_ALT_FORMAT_62 = [NumberFormat(pattern='(\\d{2})(\\d{3,4})(\\d{4})', format='\\1 \\2', leading_digits_pattern=['2[124]|[36]1'])]
```
