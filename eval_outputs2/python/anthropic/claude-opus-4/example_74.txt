Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to improve the type annotation for the `__init__` method of what appears to be a `Coerce` class.

- The HEAD version specifies that the `type` parameter should be of type `type`
- The incoming change specifies that the `type` parameter can be either `type` or `typing.Callable`

The incoming change is more permissive and semantically correct, as the `Coerce` class likely needs to accept both types (like `int`, `str`) and callable functions that can perform coercion. This is a common pattern in validation libraries where you might want to coerce values using either built-in types or custom conversion functions.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```python
        >>> validate = Schema(Coerce(int, "moo"))
        >>> with raises(MultipleInvalid, 'moo'):
        ...   validate('foo')
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        type: typing.Union[type, typing.Callable],
        msg: typing.Optional[str] = None,
    ) -> None:
        self.type = type
        self.msg = msg
        self.type_name = type.__name__

    def __call__(self, v):

```
