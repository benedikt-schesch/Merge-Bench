Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - raising a `MatchInvalid` exception with either a custom message (`self.msg`) or a default message about the regex pattern not matching.

The only difference is formatting:
- HEAD has it on a single line
- The other branch has it formatted across multiple lines for better readability

Since both achieve the same intent and the multi-line format is generally preferred for readability (especially for longer expressions), I'll resolve in favor of the more readable multi-line format:

```python
        try:
            match = self.pattern.match(v)
        except TypeError:
            raise MatchInvalid("expected string or buffer")
        if not match:
            raise MatchInvalid(
                self.msg
                or 'does not match regular expression {}'.format(self.pattern.pattern)
            )
        return v

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Match(%r, msg=%r)' % (self.pattern.pattern, self.msg)


```
