Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the only difference between the two sides is the presence or absence of a blank line after the `else` block and before the `validate_queues` method.

The HEAD version has no blank line, while the incoming change adds a blank line. This is a simple formatting difference with no semantic impact.

Following Python style conventions (PEP 8), which recommend two blank lines between top-level function and class definitions, it would be appropriate to include the blank line to separate these two methods.

Here's the resolved version:

```python
        elif isinstance(server, ResQ):
            self.resq = server
        else:
            raise Exception("Bad server argument")


    def validate_queues(self):
        """Checks if a worker is given at least one queue to work on."""
        if not self.queues:
            raise NoQueueError("Please give each worker at least one queue.")


```
