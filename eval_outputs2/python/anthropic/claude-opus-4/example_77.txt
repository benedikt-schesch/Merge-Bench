Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are modifying the `_exec` method signature. The key difference is in the type annotation for the `path` parameter:

- HEAD: `path: typing.Optional[typing.List[str]] = None`
- The other branch: `path: typing.Optional[typing.List[typing.Hashable]] = None`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants to restrict `path` to a list of strings
- The other branch wants to make `path` more flexible by allowing any hashable type (which includes strings, numbers, tuples, etc.)

Since `typing.Hashable` is more general and includes `str`, and this appears to be a type annotation update to make the code more flexible, I'll resolve in favor of the more general type annotation from the other branch:

```python
            self.__class__.__name__,
            ", ".join(repr(v) for v in self.validators),
            self.msg,
        )

    def _exec(
        self,
        funcs: typing.Iterable,
        v,
        path: typing.Optional[typing.List[typing.Hashable]] = None,
    ):
        raise NotImplementedError()


class Any(_WithSubValidators):
    """Use the first validated value.

```
