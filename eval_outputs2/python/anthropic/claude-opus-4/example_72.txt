Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they both want to pass `re.IGNORECASE` as a flag to what appears to be a `re.compile()` function call. The only difference is that one side (HEAD) has no trailing comma, while the other side has a trailing comma.

In Python, both versions are functionally identical. However, the version with the trailing comma is generally preferred as it makes future additions easier and follows common Python style conventions.

Since both sides have the same intent (passing the `re.IGNORECASE` flag), I'll resolve this by keeping the version with the trailing comma:

```python
    # quoted-string
    r'|^"([\001-\010\013\014\016-\037!#-\[\]-\177]|'
    r"""\\[\001-\011\013\014\016-\177])*"$)"""
    # end anchor, because fullmatch is not available in python 2.7
    r")\Z",
    re.IGNORECASE,
)
DOMAIN_REGEX = re.compile(
    # start anchor, because fullmatch is not available in python 2.7
    "(?:"
    # domain
```
