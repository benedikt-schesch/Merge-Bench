Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides of the merge have identical content - the only difference appears to be trailing whitespace on the line with `m1 = pow(...)`.

The HEAD version has no trailing space:
```python
            m1 = pow(c, self.d % (self.p-1), self.p)
```

The incoming change has a trailing space:
```python
            m1 = pow(c, self.d % (self.p-1), self.p) 
```

Since the semantic intent is identical and the only difference is whitespace, I'll resolve this by keeping the cleaner version without trailing whitespace:

```python
    def _decrypt(self, c):
        # compute c**d (mod n)
        if not self.has_private():
            raise TypeError("No private key")
        if (hasattr(self,'p') and hasattr(self,'q') and hasattr(self,'u')):
            m1 = pow(c, self.d % (self.p-1), self.p)
            m2 = pow(c, self.d % (self.q-1), self.q)
            h = m2 - m1
            if (h<0):
                h = h + self.q
            h = h*self.u % self.q
```
