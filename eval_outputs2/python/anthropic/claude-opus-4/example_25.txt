Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they're both defining the same function signature with the same parameters. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD has the function definition on a single line
- The other branch has split it across multiple lines for better readability

Since both versions are semantically identical and the multi-line version follows better Python style guidelines (PEP 8 recommends breaking long lines), I'll resolve by keeping the more readable multi-line version:

```python

    def __hash__(self):
        return object.__hash__(self)


def message(
    default: typing.Optional[str] = None,
    cls: typing.Optional[typing.Type[Error]] = None,
) -> typing.Callable:
    """Convenience decorator to allow functions to provide a message.

    Set a default message:

        >>> @message('not an integer')

```
