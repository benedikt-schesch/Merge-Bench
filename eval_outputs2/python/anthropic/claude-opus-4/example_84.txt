Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch): Imports `NeedleCapturePlugin` and `SaveBaselinePlugin` from the needle testing framework, along with `PluginTester` from nose plugins
- The incoming change: Imports the `sys` module

Both sides also import `os`, and there's a baseline filename definition after the imports.

Since both changes appear to be adding necessary imports for different purposes (needle/nose testing framework vs system operations), and they don't conflict semantically, I should keep both sets of imports.

```python
from needle.plugin import NeedleCapturePlugin, SaveBaselinePlugin
from nose.plugins import PluginTester
import sys
import os


baseline_filename = 'screenshots/baseline/red_box.png'

```
