Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are identical - they both have:
```python
code_text += line + '\n'
```

The only difference appears to be trailing whitespace on the HEAD version. Since the semantic intent is the same on both sides (appending the line with a newline to `code_text`), I'll resolve this by keeping the cleaner version without trailing whitespace.

```python
                if not code_text.lstrip().startswith("@"):
                    save(docs_text, code_text)
                    code_text = has_code = docs_text = ''

            has_code = True
            code_text += line + '\n'

    save(docs_text, code_text)

    return sections
