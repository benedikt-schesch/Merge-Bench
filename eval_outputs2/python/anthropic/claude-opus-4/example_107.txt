Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch) is adding `self.start = 0` - likely for pagination/offset functionality
- The incoming branch is adding `self.sort_by_date = False` - for controlling result sorting

These two additions appear to be completely independent features that don't conflict semantically. Both are initialization of different attributes in what appears to be a class constructor or initialization method. The logical resolution is to keep both additions.

```python
        self.author = None
        self.pub = None
        self.timeframe = [None, None]
        self.include_patents = True
        self.include_citations = True
        self.start = 0
        self.sort_by_date = False

    def set_words(self, words):
        """Sets words that *all* must be found in the result."""
        self.words = words


```
