Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar things with a few key differences:

1. **Unicode string prefix (`u''`)**: HEAD uses regular strings while the other branch uses unicode strings (`u'\\1 \\2'`)
2. **New field**: The other branch adds `mobile_number_portable_region=True` at the end

Since both changes are complementary and don't conflict in intent:
- The unicode string prefix is likely for Python 2/3 compatibility
- The new field addition is a feature enhancement

Here's the resolved version that incorporates both changes:

```python
    voicemail=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    no_international_dialling=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='800\\d{7}', possible_number_pattern='\\d{10}', example_number='1234567890'),
    national_prefix='1',
    preferred_extn_prefix=' extn. ',
    national_prefix_for_parsing='1',
    number_format=[NumberFormat(pattern='(\\d{3})(\\d{4})', format=u'\\1 \\2', national_prefix_optional_when_formatting=True),
        NumberFormat(pattern='(\\d{3})(\\d{3})(\\d{4})', format=u'\\1 \\2 \\3', national_prefix_optional_when_formatting=True)],
    intl_number_format=[NumberFormat(pattern='(\\d{3})(\\d{3})(\\d{4})', format=u'\\1 \\2 \\3')],
    main_country_for_code=True,
    mobile_number_portable_region=True)
```
