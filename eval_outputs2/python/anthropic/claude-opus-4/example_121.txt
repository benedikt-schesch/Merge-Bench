Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import functions from `phonenumbers.carrier`, but with different function names:

- HEAD wants: `description_for_number`, `description_for_valid_number`
- The other branch wants: `name_for_number`, `name_for_valid_number`, `safe_display_name`

Additionally, HEAD is importing `u` from `phonenumbers.util`.

Based on the context and typical patterns in phonenumbers libraries, it appears both sides are trying to import carrier-related functions. The conflict seems to be about different naming conventions or potentially different versions of the library. Without more context about the specific requirements, I cannot determine which set of functions is correct or if both are needed.

Here's the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```python

import unittest

from phonenumbers import PhoneNumber, FrozenPhoneNumber
from phonenumbers import carrier
<<<<<<< HEAD
from phonenumbers.carrier import description_for_number, description_for_valid_number
from phonenumbers.util import u
=======
from phonenumbers.carrier import name_for_number, name_for_valid_number, safe_display_name
>>>>>>> ae0482c892a4ed19444c7d9101943db2abdd558a

# Allow override library carrier metadata with the test metadata.
REAL_CARRIER_DATA = carrier.CARRIER_DATA
REAL_CARRIER_LONGEST_PREFIX = carrier.CARRIER_LONGEST_PREFIX
from .testcarrierdata import CARRIER_DATA as TEST_CARRIER_DATA

```
