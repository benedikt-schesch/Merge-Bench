Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD version has a more complete help text: `'Exclude everything other than the application\'s content when rendering subpages.'`
2. The incoming change has a shorter, incomplete help text: `'Exclude everything other when rendering subpages.'` (which is grammatically incorrect - "other" needs "than" after it)
3. The incoming change also adds a new field: `'custom_field': forms.CharField(),`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants to keep the complete, grammatically correct help text
- The incoming change wants to add a new `custom_field` to the form

The resolution should include both the correct help text from HEAD and the new field from the incoming change:

```python
    return {
        'exclusive_subpages': forms.BooleanField(
            label=capfirst(_('exclusive subpages')),
            required=False,
            initial=form.instance.parameters.get('exclusive_subpages', False),
            help_text=_(
                'Exclude everything other than the application\'s content'
                ' when rendering subpages.'),
        ),
        'custom_field': forms.CharField(),
    }


Page.create_content_type(
    ApplicationContent,

```
