Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import various profile models from `hackathon.models`. The conflict is in the list of imports:

- HEAD includes: `GoogleProfile`
- The incoming change (39669b9...) includes: `TumblrProfile`

Both sides share all the other imports: `Snippet`, `Profile`, `InstagramProfile`, `TwitterProfile`, `MeetupToken`, `GithubProfile`, `LinkedinProfile`, `FacebookProfile`

The semantic intent appears to be that both sides want to add support for different social media profile types. This seems like a case where we want to keep both additions - `GoogleProfile` from HEAD and `TumblrProfile` from the incoming change.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
import simplejson as json
from rest_framework.renderers import JSONRenderer
from rest_framework.parsers import JSONParser

# Models
from hackathon.models import Snippet, Profile, InstagramProfile, TwitterProfile, MeetupToken, GithubProfile, LinkedinProfile, FacebookProfile, GoogleProfile, TumblrProfile
from hackathon.serializers import SnippetSerializer
from hackathon.forms import UserForm


profile_track = None

```
