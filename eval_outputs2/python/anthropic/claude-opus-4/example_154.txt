Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Uses `debug.dbg()` for logging, which is consistent with the debug logging pattern used in the lines above the conflict.
- **Incoming changes**: Introduces plain `print` statements and adds a new line that prints `user_scope` information.

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to log/print the `complete_scope`
2. The incoming change adds additional debugging information about `user_scope`
3. The codebase seems to be using `debug.dbg()` as the standard logging mechanism (based on context)

The resolution should:
- Use `debug.dbg()` for consistency with the surrounding code
- Include both the `complete_scope` and the new `user_scope` information

```python
    # print a debug.dbg title
    debug.dbg()
    debug.dbg('-' * 70)
    debug.dbg(' ' * 62 + 'complete')
    debug.dbg('-' * 70)
    debug.dbg('complete_scope', scope)
    debug.dbg('user_scope', f.parser.user_scope.get_simple_for_line(row))

    try:
        path = f.get_row_path(column)
    except ParserError as e:
        path = []

```
