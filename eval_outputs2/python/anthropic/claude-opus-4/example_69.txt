Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - adding type hints to the `__init__` method of the `In` class. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD version: keeps the parameters on a single line
- The other version: splits the parameters across multiple lines for better readability

Since both versions are semantically identical and the conflict is purely about code formatting style, I'll choose the multi-line version as it follows common Python style guidelines for better readability when dealing with type hints.

```python


class In(object):
    """Validate that a value is in a collection."""

    def __init__(
        self, container: typing.Iterable, msg: typing.Optional[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        self.container = container
        self.msg = msg

    def __call__(self, v):
        try:
