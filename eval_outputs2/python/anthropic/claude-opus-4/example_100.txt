Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD branch contains a duplicated code block that tries to assign `xrange` to `range`
2. The other branch (4e51aa9df3ad136cab9d1e7be30f9c77280569c6) appears to have removed this duplication

The intent seems clear: this is Python 2/3 compatibility code where `xrange` (Python 2) is aliased to `range` for compatibility. Having this block twice is redundant and was likely an error that the other branch corrected.

The semantic intent is to have this compatibility check only once, so I'll resolve by keeping just one instance of the try/except block:

```python

try:
    range = xrange
except NameError:
    pass


def guess_prefix(directory=None):
    """Attempts to find the base directory where IVRE components are
    installed.

```
