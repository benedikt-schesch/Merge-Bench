Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they're asserting the same error message. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD version: Single line assertion
- Incoming version: Multi-line assertion with parentheses for better readability

Since both versions have identical semantic intent (checking the same error message), and the incoming version offers better readability for a long string, I'll resolve this by keeping the incoming version:

```python
>>>>>>> 1fcf849f16279d43010c89c5d8cf69d5de96a800
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(precision=6, scale=2)})
    try:
        schema({"number": '123456.712'})
    except MultipleInvalid as e:
        assert (
            str(e)
            == "Precision must be equal to 6, and Scale must be equal to 2 for dictionary value @ data['number']"
        )
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise Invalid for String"
