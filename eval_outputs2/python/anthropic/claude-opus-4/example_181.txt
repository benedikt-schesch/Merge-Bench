Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - saving an index template to Elasticsearch. The key differences are:

1. **HEAD side**: Uses `get_connection()` and doesn't return the result
2. **Incoming side**: Uses `connections.get_connection()` and returns the result

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both want to get an Elasticsearch connection
- Both want to call `put_template` with the same parameters
- The incoming side adds a `return` statement to return the result of the operation

Since the incoming change adds the `return` statement (which is likely a bug fix or improvement to allow callers to get the result), and uses the more explicit `connections.get_connection()` (which appears to be the proper module reference), the resolution should incorporate both improvements.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
        if self.order is not None:
            d['order'] = self.order
        return d

    def save(self, using=None):
        es = connections.get_connection(using or self._index._using)
        return es.indices.put_template(name=self._template_name, body=self.to_dict())


class Index(object):
    def __init__(self, name, using='default'):
        """
        :arg name: name of the index

```
