Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD has version `2.9.0.dev` - indicating development towards a 2.9.0 release
- The other branch has version `2.8.25.dev` - indicating development towards a 2.8.25 patch release

Based on semantic versioning principles and the comment that states "The version should always be set to the <next release version>.dev", the conflict resolution should choose the higher version number, which represents the most recent development target.

Since 2.9.0 is a minor version bump from 2.8.x, and is numerically higher than 2.8.25, the HEAD version (2.9.0.dev) should be kept.

```python

The version should always be set to the <next release version>.dev
The jenkins release job will automatically strip the .dev for release,
and update the version again for continued development.
"""
__version__ = '2.9.0.dev'
