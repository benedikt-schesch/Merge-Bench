Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD has version `'2.2a1'`
- The incoming change has version `'2.1.2a1'`

Both versions end with `a1` indicating they are alpha releases. The conflict appears to be between:
- A major/minor version bump to 2.2 (HEAD)
- A patch version 2.1.2 (incoming)

Since `2.2a1` is a higher version number than `2.1.2a1`, and both are alpha releases, the semantic intent appears to be moving forward with development. The HEAD version (2.2a1) represents the more advanced version number and likely the intended progression.

```python
from .choices import Choices
from .tracker import FieldTracker, ModelTracker

__version__ = '2.2a1'

```
