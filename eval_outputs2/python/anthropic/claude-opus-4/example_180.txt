Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD side: imports `get_connection` from `.connections`
- Other side: imports `connections` from `.connections`

Without more context about the codebase, it's difficult to determine which is correct or if both are needed. The conflict appears to be about whether to import a specific function (`get_connection`) or a module/object (`connections`). Since I cannot determine the intent with certainty, I should preserve the conflict.

```python
from . import analysis
<<<<<<< HEAD
from .connections import get_connection
=======
from .connections import connections
>>>>>>> 2b6358206668e2d1a8604e93e63267b4ee737225
