Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to fix the same formatting issue in the docstring - adding/removing a space between the triple quotes and the text. The difference is minimal:

- HEAD version: `""" Test with Number with no precision and scale"""`
- Other version: `"""Test with Number with no precision and scale"""`

The other version follows the more common Python docstring convention where there's no space after the opening triple quotes. Since both sides have the same intent (documenting the test function) and the other version follows better Python style conventions, I'll resolve by keeping the other version.

```python
    out_ = schema({"number": '1234.00'})
    assert float(out_.get("number")) == 1234.00


def test_number_when_precision_scale_none_yield_decimal_true():
    """Test with Number with no precision and scale"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(yield_decimal=True)})
    out_ = schema({"number": '12345678901234'})
    assert out_.get("number") == 12345678901234



```
