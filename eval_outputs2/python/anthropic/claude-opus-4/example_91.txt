Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD version: `def reserve(self, timeout=10):` - adds a timeout parameter with a default value of 10
- Other version: `def reserve(self):` - no timeout parameter

Looking at the code inside the method, I can see that `timeout` is actually being used in the function call:
```python
job = self.job_class.reserve(q, self.resq, self.__str__(), timeout=timeout)
```

This indicates that the HEAD version (with the timeout parameter) is the correct resolution, as the function body is expecting to use this `timeout` variable. Without the parameter, the code would fail with a NameError.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
            logger.info('completed job')
            logger.debug('job details: %s' % job)
        finally:
            self.done_working()

    def reserve(self, timeout=10):
        for q in self.queues:
            logger.debug('checking queue %s' % q)
            job = self.job_class.reserve(q, self.resq, self.__str__(), timeout=timeout)
            if job:
                logger.info('Found job on %s' % q)

```
