Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the same test case but in different ways:

- The HEAD side is using a try-except block to catch an `Invalid` exception and assert on its string representation
- The incoming change is using pytest's context manager (`ctx`) to assert on the exception's properties

Since the code already uses `pytest.raises` with a context manager (`as ctx:`), the incoming change is the correct approach. The HEAD side's try-except block is redundant and doesn't fit with the pytest.raises pattern.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
    with pytest.raises(
        MultipleInvalid,
        match=r"value is not allowed for dictionary value @ data\['color'\]",
    ) as ctx:
        schema({'color': ['blue', 'yellow']})
    assert len(ctx.value.errors) == 1
    assert isinstance(ctx.value.errors[0], ContainsInvalid)


def test_remove():
    """Verify that Remove works."""
    # remove dict keys

```
