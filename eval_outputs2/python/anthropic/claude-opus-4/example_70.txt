Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - adding type hints to the `__init__` method parameters. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD has the method signature on a single line
- The other branch splits it across multiple lines for better readability

Since both changes have the same intent (adding type hints) and the multi-line format is generally preferred for better readability when signatures get longer, I'll resolve by keeping the multi-line version:

```python


class NotIn(object):
    """Validate that a value is not in a collection."""

    def __init__(
        self, container: typing.Iterable, msg: typing.Optional[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        self.container = container
        self.msg = msg

    def __call__(self, v):
        try:

```
