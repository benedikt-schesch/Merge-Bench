Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version has a simpler implementation while the incoming branch is adding imports for `b64encode` and `json`. 

Based on the context, it appears that both sides want to implement the `failed_jobs` method, but the incoming branch is preparing to use base64 encoding and JSON functionality. Since the method continues to work with job data and backtrace information, these imports are likely needed for the implementation.

The semantic intent seems to be that the incoming branch is adding necessary imports that will be used in the method implementation. Therefore, I'll resolve this by keeping the imports from the incoming branch.

```python

    def size(self):
        return str(failure.count(self.resq) or 0)

    def failed_jobs(self):
        from base64 import b64encode
        try:
            import json
        except ImportError:
            import simplejson as json

        jobs = []
        for job in failure.all(self.resq, self._start, self._start + 20):
            backtrace = job['backtrace']

            if isinstance(backtrace, list):
