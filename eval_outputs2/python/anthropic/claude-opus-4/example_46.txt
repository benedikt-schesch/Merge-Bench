Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they're both updating the docstring format. The only difference is:

- HEAD version: has a space after the opening triple quotes (`""" Test`)
- Other version: no space after the opening triple quotes (`"""Test`)

The Python convention (PEP 257) recommends no space after the opening triple quotes, so the semantically correct resolution would be to use the version without the space.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```python
    out_ = schema({"number": '123456789012.00'})
    assert float(out_.get("number")) == 123456789012.00


def test_number_when_precision_none_n_invalid_scale_yield_decimal_true():
    """Test with Number with no precision and invalid scale"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(scale=2, yield_decimal=True)})
    try:
        schema({"number": '12345678901.234'})
    except MultipleInvalid as e:
