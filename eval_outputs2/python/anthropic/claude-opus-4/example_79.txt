Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the help text for the `trash-empty` command, but they're adding different options:

- HEAD is adding the `--dry-run` option
- The incoming change (302accd0) is adding the `--print-completion {bash,zsh,tcsh}` option

Since both changes appear to be adding legitimate new features to the command-line interface, the semantic intent is to include both new options. The proper resolution is to merge both additions.

```python

    def test_help(self):
        result = run_command.run_command(self.tmp_dir, "trash-empty",
                                         ['--help'])
        self.assertEqual(["""\
usage: trash-empty [-h] [--print-completion {bash,zsh,tcsh}] [--version]
                   [--trash-dir TRASH_DIR] [--all-users] [-i] [-f]
                   [--dry-run]
