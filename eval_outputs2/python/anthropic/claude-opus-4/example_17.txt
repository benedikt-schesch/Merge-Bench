Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the type annotation for the `path` parameter in the `prepend` method. 

- The HEAD version uses `typing.List[str]`
- The incoming change uses `typing.List[typing.Hashable]`

From a semantic perspective, `typing.Hashable` is more general than `str` - all strings are hashable, but not all hashable objects are strings. This suggests the incoming change is trying to make the type annotation more flexible to accept a broader range of path elements.

Since this appears to be a deliberate broadening of the accepted types (likely to support non-string keys in paths), the semantic intent seems to be to allow more flexibility. Therefore, the resolution should use the more general type annotation.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
        self.errors.append(error)

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return str(self.errors[0])

    def prepend(self, path: typing.List[typing.Hashable]) -> None:
        for error in self.errors:
            error.prepend(path)
