Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - logging debug information. The only difference is:

- HEAD uses `logger.debug()`
- The incoming change uses `logging.debug()`

Since the code already uses `logger.info()` in the `done_working()` method below, it appears that `logger` is the established logging instance being used throughout this codebase. Therefore, the HEAD version using `logger.debug()` is the semantically correct choice to maintain consistency.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
            'run_at': str(int(time.mktime(datetime.datetime.now().timetuple()))),
            'payload': job._payload
        }
        data = json.dumps(data)
        self.resq.redis["resque:worker:%s" % str(self)] = data
        logger.debug("worker:%s" % str(self))
        logger.debug(self.resq.redis["resque:worker:%s" % str(self)])

    def done_working(self):
        logger.info('done working')
        self.processed()
        self.resq.redis.delete("resque:worker:%s" % str(self))

```
