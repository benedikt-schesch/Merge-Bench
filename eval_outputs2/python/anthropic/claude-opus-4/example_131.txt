Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the same code section, but with different changes:

- HEAD version: Updates the format string to use a regular string (`'\\1 \\2 \\3'`)
- Incoming change: Updates the format string to use a unicode string (`u'\\1 \\2 \\3'`) AND adds a new parameter `mobile_number_portable_region=True`

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to update the string format (likely for Python 3 compatibility where the `u` prefix is no longer needed)
2. The incoming change also wants to add mobile number portability support

Since Python 3 treats all strings as unicode by default, the regular string format from HEAD is appropriate, and we should also include the mobile number portability feature from the incoming change.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
    voip=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    pager=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    uan=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    voicemail=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    no_international_dialling=PhoneNumberDesc(national_number_pattern='NA', possible_number_pattern='NA'),
    number_format=[NumberFormat(pattern='([2689]\\d)(\\d{3})(\\d{3})', format='\\1 \\2 \\3')],
    mobile_number_portable_region=True)

```
