Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Imports various utilities including `prnt`, `unicod`, `u`, `U_EMPTY_STRING`, `U_ZERO` from `.util`, and `format_number`, `PhoneNumberFormat`, `number_type` from `.phonenumberutil`
- **Incoming branch**: Appears to have removed those imports entirely

The lines after the conflict show additional imports from `.phonenumberutil` that both sides agree on, including another import of `number_type`.

Since `number_type` is imported again in the agreed-upon section, and the incoming branch seems to have intentionally removed the utilities from `.util` and some imports from `.phonenumberutil`, the semantic intent appears to be cleaning up unused imports while keeping the necessary ones below.
