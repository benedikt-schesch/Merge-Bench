Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Wants to call `self.read_request_data()` to get the data
- **Incoming change**: Wants to decode and parse JSON from a `data` variable

The issue is that the incoming change references a `data` variable that doesn't exist in the surrounding context. It appears the incoming change is trying to parse JSON from `data`, but `data` hasn't been defined yet.

The HEAD version makes more sense semantically - it's calling a method `self.read_request_data()` which presumably handles reading and parsing the request data properly. The incoming change seems to be missing the part where `data` is initially obtained.

Since the incoming change appears to be incomplete (using an undefined variable), and the HEAD version provides a complete solution by calling a method that likely encapsulates the data reading logic, I'll resolve in favor of HEAD:

```python

        return self.response(self.serialize_object(obj))

    def edit(self, obj):
        try:
            data = self.read_request_data()
        except ValueError:
            return self.response_bad_request()

        obj, models = self.deserialize_object(data, obj)


```
