Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD has no empty line between the import statement and the assert statement
- The other branch (1fcf849f16279d43010c89c5d8cf69d5de96a800) adds an empty line between them

This appears to be a simple formatting/style conflict. The semantic intent of both sides is the same - they both want the import statement followed by the assert statement. The only difference is whether there should be a blank line between them.

Since this is just a formatting preference and doesn't affect the functionality, and without additional context about the project's style guide, I'll preserve the version with the blank line as it provides better visual separation between the import and the assertion, which is a common Python style practice.

```python
        "toaster": str,
        Extra: object,
    }
    # toaster should be first.
    from voluptuous.schema_builder import _iterate_mapping_candidates

    assert _iterate_mapping_candidates(schema)[0][0] == 'toaster'


def test_in():
    """Verify that In works."""
```
