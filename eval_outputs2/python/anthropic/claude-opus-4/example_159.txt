Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD has version `0.6.0-alpha` (an alpha release for version 0.6.0)
- The other branch has version `0.5.4` (a stable release)

Since HEAD contains a newer version number (0.6.0-alpha vs 0.5.4) and is explicitly marked as an alpha release, the semantic intent appears to be that development has moved forward to a new major version. The conflict likely arose from a merge where one branch had continued development toward 0.6.0 while another branch had a patch or minor update to 0.5.x.

The resolution should keep the newer version number from HEAD:

```python
else:
    import setuptools as dist
    setup = dist.setup


VERSION = '0.6.0-alpha'  # Also change in pystache/__init__.py.

FILE_ENCODING = 'utf-8'

README_PATH = 'README.md'
HISTORY_PATH = 'HISTORY.md'

```
