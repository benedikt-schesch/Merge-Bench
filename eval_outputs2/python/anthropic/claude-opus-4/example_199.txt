Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to set the `self.num_spray` attribute, but they differ in the default constant being used:

- HEAD uses `DEFAULT_NUMSPRAY` 
- The other branch uses `DEFAULT_NUMSPARY` (which appears to be a typo - "SPARY" instead of "SPRAY")

Given that:
1. The attribute name is `num_spray` (with correct spelling)
2. The option key is `'num-spray'` (with correct spelling)
3. The HEAD version uses `DEFAULT_NUMSPRAY` which follows the correct spelling pattern

The intent appears to be to use a properly spelled constant name. The other branch likely contains a typo.

```python

class DefaultChooser(object):
    def __init__(self, options):
        self.grid_size = options.get('grid_size', DEFAULT_GRIDSIZE)
        self.grid_seed = options.get('grid_seed', DEFAULT_GRIDSEED)
        self.num_spray = options.get('num-spray', DEFAULT_NUMSPRAY)
        self.spray_std = options.get('spray-std', DEFAULT_SPRAYSTD)
        self.check_grad = options.get('check-grad', False)

        self.grid_subset = 20


```
