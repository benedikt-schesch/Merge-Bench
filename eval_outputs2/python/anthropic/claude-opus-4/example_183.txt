Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar functionality with two key differences:

1. **Import method**: HEAD uses `get_connection()` while the other branch uses `connections.get_connection()`
2. **Return value**: HEAD doesn't return anything while the other branch returns the result of `es.indices.put_template()`

Based on common patterns in Elasticsearch Python clients and the fact that the newer branch (2b6358206668e2d1a8604e93e63267b4ee737225) includes a return statement (which is generally more useful for callers to know if the operation succeeded), the semantic intent appears to be:
- Use the proper connection method (likely `connections.get_connection()` based on common elasticsearch-py patterns)
- Return the result of the operation

Here's the resolved code:

```python
        if self.order is not None:
            d['order'] = self.order
        return d

    def save(self, using=None):
        es = connections.get_connection(using or self._index._using)
        return es.indices.put_template(name=self._template_name, body=self.to_dict())


class Index(object):
    def __init__(self, name, using='default'):
        """
        :arg name: name of the index

```
