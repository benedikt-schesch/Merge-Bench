Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the version number in the setup configuration:

- HEAD (current branch) is setting the version to '0.15.0'
- The incoming branch is setting the version to '0.16.0'

Since the incoming branch has a higher version number (0.16.0 > 0.15.0), and assuming this is a standard version bump scenario where we want to keep the latest/highest version, the semantic intent would be to use the higher version number.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
    # TODO: put package test requirements here
]

setup(
    name='python-nvd3',
    version='0.16.0',
    description="Python NVD3 - Chart Library for d3.js",
    long_description=readme + '\n\n' + history,
    keywords='plot, graph, nvd3, d3',
    author='Belaid Arezqui',
