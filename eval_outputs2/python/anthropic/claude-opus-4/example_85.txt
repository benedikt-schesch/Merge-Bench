Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the version number. The HEAD has version '0.9' while the incoming branch has version '0.9.1'. 

Since '0.9.1' is a patch version increment from '0.9', it represents a newer version. The semantic intent appears to be moving forward with version updates, so I'll resolve this by keeping the higher version number.

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

version='0.9.1'
setup(
    name='pyres',
    version=version,
    description='Python resque clone',
    author='Matt George',

```
