Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - raising a `MultipleInvalid` exception with a `ValueInvalid` error. The only difference is formatting:

- HEAD uses a single line with the list on the same line
- The incoming change uses multi-line formatting with the list on a separate line

Since both achieve the same result and the difference is purely stylistic, I'll preserve the more readable multi-line format from the incoming change:

```python
                raise er.SequenceTypeInvalid('expected a %s' % seq_type_name, path)

            # Empty seq schema, reject any data.
            if not schema:
                if data:
                    raise er.MultipleInvalid(
                        [er.ValueInvalid('not a valid value', path if path else data)]
                    )
                return data

            out = []
            invalid = None
            errors = []

```
