Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - raising a `RangeInvalid` exception with an error message. The only difference is:

- HEAD version: Has the closing parenthesis on the same line as the message string
- Incoming version: Has the closing parenthesis on a separate line

Since the semantic intent is identical and the only difference is formatting, I'll resolve this by choosing the more common Python style of having the closing parenthesis on the same line for single-argument function calls:

```python
            return v

        # Objects that lack a partial ordering, e.g. None or strings will raise TypeError
        except TypeError:
            raise RangeInvalid(
                self.msg or 'invalid value or type (must have a partial ordering)')

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Clamp(min=%s, max=%s)' % (self.min, self.max)



```
