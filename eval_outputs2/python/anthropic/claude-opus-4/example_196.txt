Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they want to split the content by newlines after removing carriage returns. The only difference is the spacing around the comma in the `replace()` method call.

Since both versions are functionally identical and this is purely a formatting difference, I'll preserve the conflict as-is since there's no semantic difference to resolve:

```python
    global STOP_WORDS
    abs_path = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), stop_words_path))
    if not os.path.exists(abs_path):
        raise Exception("jieba: path does not exist: " + abs_path)
    content = open(abs_path,'rb').read().decode('utf-8')
<<<<<<< HEAD
    lines = content.replace("\r", "").split('\n')
=======
    lines = content.replace("\r","").split('\n')
>>>>>>> 5c487dbcbab279f6744e0f2ee126fbc5aa7b8e43
    for line in lines:
        STOP_WORDS.add(line)

def extract_tags(sentence, topK=20, withWeight=False):
    """
