Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to improve the type annotations for the `_nested_getitem` function, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD** introduces a generic `IndexT` TypeVar and uses it to ensure type consistency between the dictionary keys and the path items, while keeping the data parameter typed as a Dict.
- **The other branch** makes the function more flexible by typing `data` as `Any` (allowing it to work with any subscriptable type) and uses `typing.Hashable` for the path items.

The semantic intent of both changes appears to be:
1. Make the function work with any subscriptable data structure (not just dictionaries)
2. Provide appropriate type hints for the path parameter

The second approach (from the other branch) is more general and practical since:
- The function body already handles multiple types (catching KeyError for dicts, IndexError for sequences)
- Using `Any` for data allows the function to work with nested structures of mixed types
- `Hashable` is a reasonable constraint for indices

Here's the resolved version:

```python
# fmt: on

MAX_VALIDATION_ERROR_ITEM_LENGTH = 500


def _nested_getitem(
    data: typing.Any, path: typing.List[typing.Hashable]
) -> typing.Optional[typing.Any]:
    for item_index in path:
        try:
            data = data[item_index]
        except (KeyError, IndexError, TypeError):
            # The index is not present in the dictionary, list or other

```
