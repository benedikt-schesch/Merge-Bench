Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the context and intent of both sides:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Uses `self.rsa.importKey(self.rsaKeyPEM)`
- **Incoming change**: Uses `RSA.importKey(self.rsaKeyPEM)`

The key difference is whether to use an instance method (`self.rsa.importKey`) or a class method (`RSA.importKey`). 

Based on the test method name `testImportKey5` and the fact that this appears to be a unit test class, the most likely scenario is that:
- `self.rsa` is likely set to the `RSA` module/class in the setUp method
- Both approaches would functionally work the same way
- The incoming change is using the more direct approach by calling the class method directly

Given that this is a test for importing keys and both approaches achieve the same semantic intent (importing an RSA key from PEM format), I'll resolve this by choosing the more direct approach from the incoming change, which doesn't rely on how `self.rsa` is initialized.

```python
        self.assertEqual(key.n, self.n)
        self.assertEqual(key.e, self.e)

    def testImportKey5(self):
        """Verifies that the imported key is still a valid RSA pair"""
        key = RSA.importKey(self.rsaKeyPEM)
        idem = key.encrypt(key.decrypt(b("Test")),0)
        self.assertEqual(idem[0],b("Test"))

    def testImportKey6(self):
        """Verifies that the imported key is still a valid RSA pair"""

```
