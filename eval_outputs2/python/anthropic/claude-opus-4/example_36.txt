Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - they want to assert that the repr of `range_` matches a specific string. The only difference is formatting:

- HEAD has it on a single line
- The incoming change splits it across multiple lines for better readability (following Python style guidelines for long lines)

Since both sides have identical assertion logic and the incoming change improves code readability by breaking up a long line, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```python
    all_ = All('10', Coerce(int), msg='all msg')
    maybe_int = Maybe(int)

    assert repr(match) == "Match('a pattern', msg='message')"
    assert repr(replace) == "Replace('you', 'I', msg='you and I')"
    assert (
        repr(range_)
        == "Range(min=0, max=42, min_included=False, max_included=False, msg='number not in range')"
    )
    assert repr(coerce_) == "Coerce(int, msg='moo')"
    assert repr(all_) == "All('10', Coerce(int, msg=None), msg='all msg')"
    assert repr(maybe_int) == "Any(None, %s, msg=None)" % str(int)



```
