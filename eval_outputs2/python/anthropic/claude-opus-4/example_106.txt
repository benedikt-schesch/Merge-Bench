Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different query parameters to what appears to be a Google Scholar search URL construction:

- HEAD wants to add `&start=%(start)s` - likely for pagination/offset functionality
- The other branch wants to add `&scisbd=%(sortby)s` - likely for sorting functionality

These are complementary features rather than conflicting ones - pagination and sorting are both common search features that work together. The semantic intent is to enhance the search capabilities with both features.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
        + '&as_yhi=%(yhi)s' \
        + '&as_vis=%(citations)s' \
        + '&btnG=&hl=en' \
        + '%(num)s' \
        + '&as_sdt=%(patents)s%%2C5' \
        + '&start=%(start)s' \
        + '&scisbd=%(sortby)s'

    def __init__(self):
        ScholarQuery.__init__(self)
        self._add_attribute_type('num_results', 'Results', 0)
        self.words = None # The default search behavior

```
