Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the invocation syntax for the script, but with different approaches:

- HEAD version: `buildprefixdata.py indir outfile module_prefix` (3 positional arguments)
- Other version: `buildprefixdata.py [options] input outfile` (options + 2 arguments)

The conflict appears to be about:
1. Whether to support command-line options (`[options]`)
2. The naming of the input parameter (`indir` vs `input`)
3. Whether to include a `module_prefix` parameter

Since the "Options:" section follows immediately after, it suggests that the script does support options. The more flexible approach that includes `[options]` and uses the more generic term `input` seems to align better with having an "Options:" section. However, I cannot determine if `module_prefix` is still needed without more context.

Given the ambiguity about whether `module_prefix` is required and what the actual intent is, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""Script to read the libphonenumber per-prefix metadata and generate Python code.

Invocation:
<<<<<<< HEAD
  buildprefixdata.py indir outfile module_prefix
=======
  buildprefixdata.py [options] input outfile
>>>>>>> ae0482c892a4ed19444c7d9101943db2abdd558a

Processes all of the per-prefix data under the given input directory and emit
generated Python code.

Options:
