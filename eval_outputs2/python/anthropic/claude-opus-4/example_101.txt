Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD is trying to import the `coverage` module
- The other branch (d5fc415e7e1577bce484d7d024020d40cebe81de) doesn't have this import

Without more context about the intent of both branches, I cannot determine whether the `coverage` import should be included or not. The `coverage` module is typically used for code coverage analysis during testing, but I don't have enough information to know if this is intentional or if one side is adding test infrastructure while the other isn't.

Since the intent is ambiguous, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```python
try:
    from cStringIO import StringIO
except ImportError:
    from io import StringIO
from contextlib import contextmanager
<<<<<<< HEAD
