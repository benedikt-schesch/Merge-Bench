Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: After the `topvalues` checks, it adds code coverage stopping/saving and runs a test for `scancli.py --init`
- **Incoming change**: Simply removes those lines, moving directly to the `test_passive` method

The conflict appears to be about whether to include the coverage stopping and `scancli.py --init` test before the `test_passive` method. Since the HEAD version includes additional test setup/teardown logic that seems intentional (stopping coverage and initializing something with scancli.py), while the incoming change removes it entirely, I should preserve the HEAD version as it contains more complete test logic.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```python
            "nmap_tophop",
            list(ivre.db.db.nmap.topvalues("hop"))[0]['_id'])
        self.check_value(
            "nmap_tophop_10+",
            list(ivre.db.db.nmap.topvalues("hop>10"))[0]['_id'])

        cov.stop()
        cov.save()
        self.assertEqual(RUN(["./bin/scancli.py", "--init"],
                              stdin=open(os.devnull))[0], 0)

    def test_passive(self):

        # Init DB
        self.assertEqual(RUN(["./bin/ipinfo.py", "--count"])[1], "0\n")

```
