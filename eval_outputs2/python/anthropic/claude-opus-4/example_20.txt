Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (the branch `1fcf849f16279d43010c89c5d8cf69d5de96a800`) wants to add a `# fmt: off` comment before the imports, while HEAD doesn't have this comment.

The `# fmt: off` comment is typically used to disable automatic code formatting (like Black) for a specific section of code. Since this appears to be at the start of a file with import statements, the intent seems to be to prevent the formatter from reorganizing these imports.

The semantic intent appears to be: maintain the specific import order without allowing automatic formatters to change it. This is a common practice when import order matters for some reason.

Here's the resolved version:

```python
# fmt: off
from __future__ import annotations

import collections
import inspect
import itertools

```
