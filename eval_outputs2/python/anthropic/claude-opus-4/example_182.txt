Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD wants to import `get_connection` from `.connections`
- The other branch wants to import `connections` from `.connections`

Without more context about the codebase, it's difficult to determine which is correct or if both are needed. The conflict could represent:
1. A refactoring where `connections` was changed to `get_connection` (or vice versa)
2. Different features that need different imports
3. A naming inconsistency that needs resolution

Since I cannot determine the semantic intent with certainty, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```python
from . import analysis
<<<<<<< HEAD
from .connections import get_connection
=======
from .connections import connections
