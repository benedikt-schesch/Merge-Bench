Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to fix the same issue - adjusting the docstring format. The only difference is:

- HEAD version: `""" Test with Number with no precision and valid scale case 1"""`
- Other version: `"""Test with Number with no precision and valid scale case 1"""`

The conflict is about whether to have a space after the opening triple quotes. The "other" version (without the space) follows the more common Python docstring convention where there's no space between the opening quotes and the text. This is also consistent with PEP 257.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```python
    out_ = schema({"number": '12345678901234'})
    assert out_.get("number") == 12345678901234


def test_number_when_precision_none_n_valid_scale_case1_yield_decimal_true():
    """Test with Number with no precision and valid scale case 1"""
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(scale=2, yield_decimal=True)})
    out_ = schema({"number": '123456789.34'})
    assert float(out_.get("number")) == 123456789.34



```
