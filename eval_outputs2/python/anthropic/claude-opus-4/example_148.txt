Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - adding a check for a build script and printing an error message. The differences are:

1. **Head** checks for "buildgeocodingdata.py" while the **incoming change** checks for "buildprefixdata.py"
2. **Head** uses the modern Python `print()` function with `file=sys.stderr`, while the **incoming change** uses the older Python 2 style `print >>` syntax

Since both checks appear to be valid (they're checking for different build scripts that likely both exist), and we should use the modern Python syntax, the semantic resolution should include both script names and use the modern print syntax:

```python
    # The generation process imports this module, creating a circular
    # dependency.  The hack below works around this.
    import os
    import sys
    if (os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildmetadatafromxml.py" or
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildgeocodingdata.py" or
        os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) == "buildprefixdata.py"):
        prnt("Failed to import generated data (but OK as during autogeneration)", file=sys.stderr)
        _ALT_NUMBER_FORMATS = {}
    else:
        raise
