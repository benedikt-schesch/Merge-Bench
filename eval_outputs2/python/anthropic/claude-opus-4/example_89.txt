Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to format the docstring for the Worker class. The only difference is how the line break is handled:

- HEAD version: Has a line break after "Worker" and before "class"
- The other version: Keeps "Worker class and" on the same line

Both versions have the same semantic intent - they're documenting the Worker class. The other version appears to have better formatting by keeping "Worker class and" together on one line, which reads more naturally.

Here's the resolved version:

```python


logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Worker(object):
    """Defines a worker. The ``pyres_worker`` script instantiates this Worker class and
    passes a comma-separated list of queues to listen on.::

       >>> from pyres.worker import Worker
       >>> Worker.run([queue1, queue2], server="localhost:6379")

    """

```
