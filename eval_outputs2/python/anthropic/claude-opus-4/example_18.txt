Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the `import typing` statement, but they've placed it in different locations:

- HEAD has `import typing` after the other imports
- The other branch (1fcf849f16279d43010c89c5d8cf69d5de96a800) has removed this duplicate import

Since `import typing` already appears at the very beginning of the file (first line), the second import in HEAD is redundant. The other branch correctly removed this duplication.

Here's the resolved code:

```python
import typing

from voluptuous import Invalid, MultipleInvalid
from voluptuous.error import Error
from voluptuous.schema_builder import Schema

# fmt: on

MAX_VALIDATION_ERROR_ITEM_LENGTH = 500


```
