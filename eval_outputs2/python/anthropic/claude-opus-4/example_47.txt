Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they're asserting that the error message equals a specific string. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD has the assertion on a single line
- The incoming change splits it across multiple lines with parentheses for better readability

Since both sides have the same semantic intent and the incoming change provides better code formatting (following Python style guidelines for long lines), I'll resolve by keeping the incoming change's formatting.

```python
    schema = Schema({"number": Number(scale=2, yield_decimal=True)})
    try:
        schema({"number": '12345678901.234'})
    except MultipleInvalid as e:
        assert (
            str(e) == "Scale must be equal to 2 for dictionary value @ data['number']"
        )
    else:
        assert False, "Did not raise Invalid for String"
