Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - adding type hints to the `raises` function. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD has the function definition on a single line
- The other branch has split it across multiple lines for better readability

Since both changes add the same type hints (`msg: typing.Optional[str] = None, regex: typing.Optional[re.Pattern] = None`) and return type (`-> Generator[None, None, None]`), and the multi-line format is generally preferred for functions with multiple parameters (following PEP 8 style guidelines for line length), I'll resolve this by keeping the multi-line version:

```python
        return value
    return lambda: value


@contextmanager
def raises(
    exc, msg: typing.Optional[str] = None, regex: typing.Optional[re.Pattern] = None
) -> Generator[None, None, None]:
    try:
        yield
    except exc as e:
        if msg is not None:
            assert str(e) == msg, '%r != %r' % (str(e), msg)

```
