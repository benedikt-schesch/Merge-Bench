Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to test importing an RSA key from PEM format, but with some differences:

**HEAD side:**
- Uses method name `testImportKey3`
- Uses `self.rsa.importKey`
- Uses `self.failUnless` assertion style

**Other side:**
- Uses method name `testImportKey3unicode` (suggesting it's specifically testing unicode/bytes handling)
- Uses `RSA.importKey` directly
- Wraps the PEM key in `b()` (likely a bytes conversion function)
- Uses `self.assertEqual(..., True)` assertion style

The semantic intent of both sides appears to be testing the same functionality - importing a PEM key and verifying it has private components. The differences seem to be:
1. The other side is being more explicit about bytes/unicode handling
2. Different assertion styles (older unittest vs newer)
3. Different ways of accessing the RSA module

Given that the other side seems to have more specific intent around unicode/bytes handling (evident from the method name and use of `b()`), and uses a more modern assertion style, I'll resolve in favor of the other side's approach:

```python
        key = self.rsa.importKey(self.rsaPublicKeyDER)
        self.failIf(key.has_private())
        self.assertEqual(key.n, self.n)
        self.assertEqual(key.e, self.e)

    def testImportKey3unicode(self):
        key = RSA.importKey(b(self.rsaKeyPEM))
        self.assertEqual(key.has_private(),True) # assert_
        self.assertEqual(key.n, self.n)
        self.assertEqual(key.e, self.e)
        self.assertEqual(key.d, self.d)
        self.assertEqual(key.p, self.p)
        self.assertEqual(key.q, self.q)

```
