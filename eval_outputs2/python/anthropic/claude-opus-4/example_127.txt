Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

1. **HEAD (current branch)**: Defines `_COLOMBIA_MOBILE_TO_FIXED_LINE_PREFIX` using `unicod("3")` (note: this appears to be a typo of `unicode`)
2. **Incoming branch**: 
   - Defines `_COLOMBIA_MOBILE_TO_FIXED_LINE_PREFIX` as a plain string `"3"`
   - Adds a new constant `_MOBILE_TOKEN_MAPPINGS` with a dictionary mapping

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to define the Colombia mobile-to-fixed prefix
- The incoming branch also wants to add a new mobile token mappings feature
- The conflict is mainly about how to represent the string "3" (with or without the `unicod` wrapper)

Given the context where other constants use `u()` function (likely for unicode compatibility), and considering that `unicod` appears to be a typo, the resolution should:
1. Use the `u()` function consistently with other constants in the file
2. Include the new `_MOBILE_TOKEN_MAPPINGS` constant from the incoming branch

Here's the resolved code:

```python
UNKNOWN_REGION = u("ZZ")
# The set of regions that share country calling code 1.
_NANPA_COUNTRY_CODE = 1
# The prefix that needs to be inserted in front of a Colombian landline number
# when dialed from a mobile phone in Colombia.
_COLOMBIA_MOBILE_TO_FIXED_LINE_PREFIX = u("3")
# Map of country calling codes that use a mobile token before the area
# code. One example of when this is relevant is when determining the length of
# the national destination code, which should be the length of the area code
# plus the length of the mobile token.
_MOBILE_TOKEN_MAPPINGS = {52: u('1'), 54: u('9')}
# The PLUS_SIGN signifies the international prefix.
_PLUS_SIGN = u("+")
_STAR_SIGN = u('*')
_RFC3966_EXTN_PREFIX = u(";ext=")
_RFC3966_PREFIX = u("tel:")
```
