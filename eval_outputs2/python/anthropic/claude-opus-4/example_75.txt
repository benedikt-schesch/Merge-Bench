Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to format the `__init__` method signature, with the only difference being the line breaking style:

- HEAD has the entire signature on one line
- The other branch breaks it across multiple lines for better readability

Since both versions are functionally identical and the multi-line format is generally preferred for long method signatures (following PEP 8 style guidelines), I'll resolve this by keeping the multi-line version:

```python
    Special class to use as a parent class for validators using sub-validators.
    This class provides the `__voluptuous_compile__` method so the
    sub-validators are compiled by the parent `Schema`.
    """

    def __init__(
        self, *validators, msg=None, required=False, discriminant=None, **kwargs
    ) -> None:
        self.validators = validators
        self.msg = msg
        self.required = required
        self.discriminant = discriminant


```
