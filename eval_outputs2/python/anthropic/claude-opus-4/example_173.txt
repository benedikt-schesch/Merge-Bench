Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

**HEAD (current branch)**: Imports `size`, `inverse`, and `GCD` from `Crypto.Util.number`

**Incoming branch**: Adds Python 2.1 compatibility check and imports `size` and `inverse` from `Crypto.Util.number` (but not `GCD`)

The semantic intent appears to be:
- The incoming branch wants to ensure Python 2.1 compatibility
- The HEAD wants to use the `GCD` function in addition to `size` and `inverse`

The resolution should include both the Python 2.1 compatibility check AND import all three functions (`size`, `inverse`, and `GCD`).

```python

__all__ = ['rsa_construct']

import sys

if sys.version_info[0] == 2 and sys.version_info[1] == 1:
    from Crypto.Util.py21compat import *
from Crypto.Util.number import size, inverse, GCD

class error(Exception):
    pass

class _RSAKey(object):
