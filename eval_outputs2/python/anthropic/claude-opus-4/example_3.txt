Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Adds a line to set the background color of the parent panel to white
- Incoming change (d523b6a...): Removes that line (or never had it)

The semantic intent appears to be a styling choice - whether the parent panel should have a white background or use the default background. Since this is a minor styling difference and both versions would work functionally, I'll preserve the HEAD version which explicitly sets the background color, as it appears to be an intentional styling choice that was added.

```python
            modificationManager.refresh()

        # Create filelist
        if len(self.torrent.files) > 0:
            parent = wx.Panel(self.notebook)
            parent.SetBackgroundColour(wx.WHITE)
            
            self.listCtrl = SelectableListCtrl(parent)
            self.listCtrl.InsertColumn(0, 'Name')
            self.listCtrl.InsertColumn(1, 'Size', wx.LIST_FORMAT_RIGHT)

            if isinstance(self, LibraryDetails):
