Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD wants to: `import os as c4`
- The other branch wants to: `import tokenize as c4`

Both sides are importing different modules but aliasing them to the same name `c4`. The comment after both imports suggests they might have originally been importing `Scope` from a `parsing` module.

However, looking at the rest of the code, `c4` is assigned to `c5`, then `c5` is reassigned to `1`, and finally there's a problematic line `return c5+1+'asdf'` which will cause a TypeError (trying to add an integer to a string).

Given that:
1. The actual module imported doesn't seem to matter since `c4` is immediately reassigned through `c5` and then `c5` becomes `1`
2. The code has other issues that make the specific import choice irrelevant
3. I cannot determine the true semantic intent from the context

I should preserve the conflict as-is:

```python
# completion
import time
class c1():
    c2,c5 = c1(), c1().c3()
    def c3(self): 
<<<<<<< HEAD
        import os as c4 #from parsing import Scope as c4
=======
        import tokenize as c4 #from parsing import Scope as c4
>>>>>>> 118908f3118ef557502dd35ca10a98ca547f3ce1
        c5 = c4
        c5 = 1
        return c5+1+'asdf'



```
