Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to register the same plugin (`PluginTVMazeLookup`) with the same name (`'tvmaze_lookup'`), but with different parameters:

- HEAD version: `api_ver=2`
- Incoming version: `api_ver=3` and adds `groups=['series_metainfo']`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- The incoming change wants to upgrade the API version from 2 to 3
- The incoming change also wants to add the plugin to the 'series_metainfo' group

Since the incoming change has both a higher API version and additional functionality (the groups parameter), it seems like the intended resolution is to accept the incoming version which represents the more complete/updated implementation.

```python
        return 'tvmaze_id'


@event('plugin.register')
def register_plugin():
    plugin.register(PluginTVMazeLookup, 'tvmaze_lookup', api_ver=3, groups=['series_metainfo'])

```
