An analysis of the conflict reveals two different method signatures for `get_page`.

*   **HEAD:** `def get_page(target_url)` defines the method with a single, required positional argument.
*   **Incoming:** `def get_page(target_url: nil)` changes the method to use a keyword argument that is optional and defaults to `nil`.

The semantic intent of this method, as described by the documentation (`@param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page`) and its implementation (the `target_url` variable is passed directly to a `request` method), is to fetch a specific page using a provided URL. A `nil` URL would likely cause an error.

The incoming change attempts to modernize the method signature to use keyword arguments, but by making `target_url` optional, it introduces a contradiction with the method's purpose and implementation. This would allow the method to be called without a URL, leading to a runtime failure.

The most sound resolution is to preserve the method's required argument contract. The `HEAD` version correctly enforces this. While the intent to use keyword arguments is noted, the implementation in the incoming branch is flawed. Therefore, the correct and safe resolution is to use the version from `HEAD`.

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of ChannelInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of ChannelInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return ChannelPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
