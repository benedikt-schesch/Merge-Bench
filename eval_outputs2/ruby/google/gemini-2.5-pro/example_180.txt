An expert in semantic merge conflict resolution would analyze the intent behind both changes.

*   **HEAD** `def get_page(target_url)`: This uses a standard Ruby positional argument. The intent is to define a method that requires a `target_url` to be passed to it.
*   **d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0** `def get_page(target_url: nil)`: This changes the method to use a keyword argument. Using keyword arguments is a more modern and explicit style in Ruby. However, by providing a default value of `nil`, it makes the argument optional. This contradicts the method's purpose and implementation, which clearly require a URL to function, and could lead to a runtime error if called without the `target_url`.

The semantic resolution is to combine the best of both intents:
1.  Use the modern keyword argument syntax from the `d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0` branch.
2.  Enforce that the `target_url` is a mandatory argument, as intended by the `HEAD` branch and the method's logic.

In modern Ruby (2.1+), this is achieved by defining a required keyword argument, which is written without a default value. This respects the stylistic improvement of one branch while maintaining the logical correctness of the other.

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of AlertInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of AlertInstance
          def get_page(target_url:)
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return AlertPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
