Resolving this merge conflict requires understanding the intended logic from both branches.

*   The `HEAD` branch introduces logic to handle a `USER_PATH`. It checks if this path exists and, if so, compares the timestamp of its last git commit against a `VENDORED_TIMESTAMP`. However, the implementation is incomplete and does not return anything, leaving the method in a broken state.
*   The other branch (`4ab77a880bd4720881ca02294ce6bf009e278bd3`) provides a simple and functional implementation that returns a `DEFAULT_PATH`.

The semantic intent is to create a more dynamic way of selecting the database path. The `HEAD` branch wants to use a user-provided database if it's newer, while the other branch provides the fallback default path.

A proper resolution is to complete the logic from `HEAD` and use the code from the other branch as the default case. The combined logic should be: if the `USER_PATH` directory exists and is newer than the vendored copy, use `USER_PATH`; otherwise, fall back to `DEFAULT_PATH`.

```ruby
      #
      # @return [String]
      #   The path to the database directory.
      #
      def self.path
        if File.directory?(USER_PATH)
          t1 = Dir.chdir(USER_PATH) { Time.parse(`git log --date=iso8601 --pretty="%cd" -1`).utc }
          t2 = VENDORED_TIMESTAMP

          return USER_PATH if t1 > t2
        end

        DEFAULT_PATH
      end

      #
      # Tests whether the database exists.
      #
      # @param [String] path
```
