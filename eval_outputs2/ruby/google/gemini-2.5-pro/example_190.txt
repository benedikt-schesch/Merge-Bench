Resolving this conflict requires understanding the semantic difference between the two proposed method signatures for `get_page`.

*   **HEAD Version:** `def get_page(target_url)`
    This defines `get_page` with a single mandatory positional argument. The method cannot be called without providing a `target_url`. This aligns with the documentation (`@param [String] target_url`) which specifies that a string URL is expected.

*   **d26f64b7... Version:** `def get_page(target_url: nil)`
    This version refactors the method to use a keyword argument, which is a common modern Ruby idiom. However, it also provides a default value of `nil`, making the `target_url` optional.

**Intent Analysis:**
The intent of the `d26f64b7...` branch appears to be a stylistic refactoring to use keyword arguments. However, making `target_url` optional conflicts with both the method's documentation and its implementation. The method body unconditionally uses `target_url` in an API request: `request('GET', target_url)`. Passing `nil` here would likely cause a runtime error.

The most logical resolution is to adopt the functionally correct and safer implementation. The `HEAD` version is guaranteed to work as documented, whereas the other version introduces a likely bug by allowing a `nil` value for a required parameter. Therefore, we will keep the version from `HEAD`.

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of MobileInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of MobileInstance
              def get_page(target_url)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return MobilePage.new(@version, response, @solution)
