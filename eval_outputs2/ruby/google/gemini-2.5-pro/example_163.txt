This merge conflict involves a change to a method signature.

*   The `HEAD` branch defines the method with a standard positional argument: `def get_page(target_url)`.
*   The `d26f64b7...` branch changes this to an optional keyword argument: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`.

The intent of the `d26f64b7...` branch appears to be a modernization of the method signature to use keyword arguments, which improves call-site readability. Making the argument optional suggests that calling `get_page` without a URL might be intended to fetch the first page of results, assuming the underlying `request` method can handle a `nil` URL. This is a common pattern in API client libraries.

Given that this change is more specific and likely part of a broader stylistic or functional update, it represents the more forward-looking state of the code. Therefore, we will adopt the change from the `d26f64b7...` branch.

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of DailyInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of DailyInstance
                def get_page(target_url: nil)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return DailyPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
