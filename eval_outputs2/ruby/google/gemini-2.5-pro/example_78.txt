In this merge conflict, the `HEAD` branch introduces a new method `name_status`, while the other branch has no changes in this location. The addition of this new method is self-contained and does not conflict with any other logic. The clear semantic intent is to add this new functionality. Therefore, the resolution is to keep the code from the `HEAD` branch.

```ruby
      @full_diff = nil
      @full_diff_files = nil
      @stats = nil
    end
    attr_reader :from, :to
   
    def name_status
      cache_name_status
    end

    def path(path)
      @path = path
      return self
    end

```
