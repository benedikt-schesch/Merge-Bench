An analysis of the conflict reveals two different method signatures for `get_page`.

- The `HEAD` version uses a standard positional argument: `def get_page(target_url)`. This makes the argument mandatory.
- The `d26f64b7...` version refactors this to be an optional keyword argument with a default of `nil`: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`.

The semantic intent of `HEAD` is that `target_url` is a required parameter for the method to function, which is supported by the method's logic that immediately uses this parameter in an API request. The intent of the other branch is to modernize the method signature to use keyword arguments for better readability. However, making the argument optional with a `nil` default would cause the subsequent request to fail if the method were called without it.

The best resolution is to combine these intents: use a keyword argument, but make it required. This is achieved in modern Ruby by defining the method with a keyword argument that has no default value. This respects the refactoring towards keyword arguments while preserving the mandatory nature of the parameter.

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of MediaInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of MediaInstance
              def get_page(target_url:)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return MediaPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
