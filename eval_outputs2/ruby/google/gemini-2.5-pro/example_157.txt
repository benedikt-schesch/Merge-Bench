The semantic conflict here is between two different method signatures for the same function, `get_page`.

*   The `HEAD` version uses a traditional positional argument: `def get_page(target_url)`.
*   The incoming change (`d26f64b...`) uses a keyword argument: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`.

In modern Ruby, using keyword arguments is often preferred for clarity, especially for methods that are part of a public API. It makes the calling code more explicit (e.g., `get_page(target_url: '...')` vs. `get_page('...')`). The intent of the incoming change appears to be a modernization or standardization of the method signature. Adopting the keyword argument is the better path forward as it aligns with this intent.

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of ConnectAppInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of ConnectAppInstance
            def get_page(target_url: nil)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return ConnectAppPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
