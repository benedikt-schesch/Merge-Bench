In RSpec, both `be true` and `be_truthy` are used to test for positive results.
*   `be true` is a strict matcher that only passes if the value is the boolean object `true`.
*   `be_truthy` is a more lenient matcher that passes for any value that is not `false` or `nil`.

The method being tested is `Term.unicode?`. In Ruby, methods ending with a question mark are predicates by convention and are expected to return a strict boolean (`true` or `false`). From this perspective, `be true` is a more precise assertion.

However, the intent of the test, described as `"marks unicode as available"`, is to check for a state of "availability". In this context, any "truthy" value could signify this state. Using `be_truthy` makes the test less brittle and more focused on the semantic outcome rather than the specific implementation detail of returning the boolean singleton `true`. This is a common practice in modern RSpec to create more robust tests.

Given that one side of the conflict is explicitly moving to `be_truthy`, this likely represents a deliberate style choice or a project-wide convention to prefer the more semantic, less strict matcher. Therefore, we will adopt the `be_truthy` change.

    end

    it "marks unicode as available" do
      Encoding.stub(:default_external).and_return(Encoding::UTF_8)
      Term.unicode?.should be_truthy
    end

    it 'marks color as unavailable' do
      STDOUT.stub(:tty?).and_return(false)
