This merge conflict is between two styles of defining a method argument in Ruby.

*   The `HEAD` branch uses a standard positional argument: `def get_page(target_url)`. This makes the argument mandatory.
*   The `d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0` branch uses a keyword argument with a default `nil` value: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`.

The likely intent of the `d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0` branch is to migrate the codebase to use keyword arguments for consistency and clarity, a common practice in modern Ruby libraries. This makes method calls more explicit (e.g., `get_page(target_url: 'http://...')` instead of `get_page('http://...')`).

Although providing a default of `nil` for a seemingly required parameter might seem counter-intuitive, it's a standard convention in this type of library-wide refactoring. The responsibility to provide a valid URL is on the caller, as implied by the documentation and the method's purpose.

Therefore, the resolution should adopt the more modern keyword argument syntax.

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of PayloadInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of PayloadInstance
                def get_page(target_url: nil)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return PayloadPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
