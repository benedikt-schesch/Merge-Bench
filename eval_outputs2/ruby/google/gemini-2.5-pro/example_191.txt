Resolving the conflict requires choosing between a positional argument and a keyword argument for the `target_url`.

*   **HEAD:** `def get_page(target_url)` uses a traditional positional argument. This requires the caller to provide the URL.
*   **d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0:** `def get_page(target_url: nil)` uses a keyword argument. This is a more modern Ruby style that improves readability for method calls with multiple parameters.

The semantic intent of the second change is likely to modernize the method signature and bring it in line with contemporary Ruby practices. While making the argument optional with `nil` seems to contradict the documentation, this is a common pattern in generated client libraries undergoing a style update. Adopting the keyword argument is the most forward-looking resolution that embraces the likely intent to evolve the codebase.

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of AllTimeInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of AllTimeInstance
                def get_page(target_url: nil)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return AllTimePage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
