The `HEAD` branch introduces a `reader.rb` file and renames `parse.rb` to `parser.rb`. The other branch (`107cb87...`) keeps the old `parse.rb` and adds a `smarter_csv.rb` file.

The semantic intent of `HEAD` is to create a more organized structure with distinct `parser`, `reader`, and `writer` components, which is a common and logical pattern. The other branch's structure is less clear.

The correct resolution is to adopt the changes from `HEAD`, as they represent a clearer and more evolved structure for the library.

```ruby
require 'smarter_csv/header_transformations'
require 'smarter_csv/header_validations'
require "smarter_csv/headers"
require "smarter_csv/hash_transformations"

require "smarter_csv/parser"
require "smarter_csv/writer"
require "smarter_csv/reader"

# load the C-extension:
case RUBY_ENGINE
when 'ruby'
  begin
