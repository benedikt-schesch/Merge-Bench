This appears to be a style and syntax update. The `HEAD` branch uses a standard positional argument, while the incoming change `d26f64b7...` updates the method signature to use an optional keyword argument.

The intent of the incoming change is likely to modernize the method signature to use keyword arguments, which improves readability and is a common pattern in modern Ruby. However, making `target_url` optional with a `nil` default contradicts the documentation (`@param [String] target_url`) and the method's logic, which passes the URL directly to a request method where `nil` would likely cause an error.

The best way to merge these intents is to adopt the keyword argument syntax while enforcing that the argument is required. This is achieved using the required keyword argument syntax (`arg_name:`), which respects the original contract that `target_url` must be provided.

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of OutgoingCallerIdInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of OutgoingCallerIdInstance
            def get_page(target_url:)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return OutgoingCallerIdPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
