The conflict arises from two different method signatures for `get_page`. The `HEAD` version uses a standard positional argument, `target_url`. The other version refactors this to be a keyword argument, `target_url:`, but provides a default value of `nil`.

Looking at the method's implementation, `target_url` is passed directly to a `request` method. If `target_url` is `nil` (which is possible with the keyword argument version), the request will likely fail. The documentation also describes `target_url` as a required parameter.

The semantic intent of the second branch is likely to modernize the method signature to use keyword arguments, which improves call-site readability. However, making the argument optional with `nil` as a default is a mistake given its usage.

The best resolution is to combine the intents: use the modern keyword argument syntax but enforce that the argument is required, which aligns with the documentation, the method's logic, and the original intent. In modern Ruby, a required keyword argument is specified by using a colon with no default value.

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of EventInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of EventInstance
            def get_page(target_url:)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return EventPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
