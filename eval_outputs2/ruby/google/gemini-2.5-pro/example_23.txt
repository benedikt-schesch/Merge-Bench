Resolving this merge conflict requires understanding the semantic intent of both changes.

*   **HEAD (`<<<`):** The line `name = Net::IMAP.decode_utf7(name.to_s)` is intended to handle mailbox names that contain non-ASCII characters. IMAP uses a modified version of UTF-7 to encode such names. This change ensures that any given name is decoded into a standard UTF-8 string before being used internally (e.g., as a key in a hash).

*   **Incoming Change (`>>>`):** The line `name = labels.localize(name)` is designed to add a layer of abstraction for common mailbox names. For example, it could translate a user-friendly symbol like `:inbox` or `:trash` into the actual folder name used by the server (e.g., "INBOX", "Boîte de réception", "[Gmail]/Trash"). This is a common feature for email clients that support multiple languages or services with different standard folder names.

Both changes aim to canonicalize the `name` argument before it's used, but they address different concerns: one for encoding and the other for localization. They are not mutually exclusive and, in fact, are complementary. A robust implementation would handle both scenarios.

The correct resolution is to apply both transformations. The logical order is to first localize the name (to convert a symbol like `:inbox` to a string like `"INBOX"`) and then ensure the resulting string is properly decoded.

```ruby
      #     mailbox.count(:all)
      #     ...
      #   end
      def mailbox(name, &block)
        @mailbox_mutex.synchronize do
          name = labels.localize(name)
          name = Net::IMAP.decode_utf7(name.to_s)
          mailbox = (mailboxes[name] ||= Mailbox.new(self, name))
          switch_to_mailbox(mailbox) if @current_mailbox != mailbox

          if block_given?
            mailbox_stack << @current_mailbox

```
