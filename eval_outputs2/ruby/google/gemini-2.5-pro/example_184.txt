The conflict is between a method signature using a positional argument (`HEAD`) and one using an optional keyword argument (`d26f64b...`).

The intent of `HEAD` is to require the `target_url` parameter, which aligns with the method's documentation and its usage within the function body, as it's passed directly to a request.

The intent of the `d26f64b...` branch is likely to modernize the method signature to use keyword arguments for better readability and consistency. However, by providing a default value of `nil`, it makes the argument optional, which contradicts the method's purpose and would likely cause a runtime error if called without the argument.

The best semantic resolution is to combine these intents: adopt the modern keyword argument syntax but preserve the requirement that the argument must be provided. This is achieved in modern Ruby by defining a required keyword argument (a keyword argument without a default value).

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of LastMonthInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of LastMonthInstance
                def get_page(target_url:)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return LastMonthPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
