Resolving this conflict requires combining the intents of both branches.
- The `HEAD` branch introduces a helper method `log_exception(job, e)`, which is likely a refactoring to centralize and standardize exception logging.
- The other branch (`757f5852...`) adds two key improvements:
    1. It passes the `e.backtrace` to `job.reschedule` for more detailed context on rescheduling.
    2. It explicitly returns the `job` after handling the failure, which is consistent with the successful return path.

The best resolution is to combine these improvements. We will use the more detailed `reschedule` call and the explicit `return` from the secondary branch, while keeping the cleaner `log_exception` helper from `HEAD`. The explicit logging calls in the secondary branch are likely superseded by the new helper method.

```ruby

          return job
        rescue LockError
          # We did not get the lock, some other worker process must have
          logger.warn "* [JOB] failed to aquire exclusive lock for #{job.name}"
        rescue StandardError => e
          job.reschedule e.message, e.backtrace
          log_exception(job, e)
          return job
        end
      end

      nil
