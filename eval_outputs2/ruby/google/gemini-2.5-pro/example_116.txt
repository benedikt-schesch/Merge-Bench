This is a common merge conflict in RSpec tests where one branch updates the test to use a more idiomatic matcher.

*   **HEAD** (`Term.color?.should be false`): This branch uses the strict `be false` matcher, which passes only if the result is exactly the boolean `false`.
*   **Incoming** (`Term.color?.should be_falsey`): This branch uses the `be_falsey` matcher. This is generally preferred in the RSpec community as it is more robust, passing for anything that Ruby considers "falsey" (`false` or `nil`).

**Intent:** Both sides intend to test that when `STDOUT` is not a TTY, the system reports that color is not available.

**Resolution:** The `be_falsey` matcher from the incoming branch is a better choice. It's a common style improvement that makes the test less brittle to implementation details (e.g., if the method changed to return `nil` instead of `false`). This change correctly captures the intent of the test while adhering to modern RSpec best practices. The stray conflict markers are removed to produce a clean, resolved file.

```ruby
    end

    it 'marks color as unavailable' do
      STDOUT.stub(:tty?).and_return(false)
      Term.color?.should be_falsey
    end

    it 'marks color as available' do
      STDOUT.stub(:tty?).and_return(true)

```
