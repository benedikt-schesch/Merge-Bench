The merge conflict in the code snippet revolves around the addition of the following line in one branch:

```ruby
@has_rails = !! defined?(Rails)
```

This line checks whether the `Rails` constant is defined and assigns the boolean result to the instance variable `@has_rails`. The rest of the code in both versions of the file remains unchanged.

Since there is no modification from the `HEAD` branch in this section and the intent of adding `@has_rails` is not ambiguous, the semantic and safe resolution is to keep the line added by the other branch. This ensures that the functionality added by this line is preserved without interfering with the rest of the code.

Below is the resolved code snippet in markdown code syntax with the full context preserved as is:

```ruby
    headerA = []
    result = []
    old_row_sep = $/
    @file_line_count = 0
    @csv_line_count = 0
    @has_rails = !! defined?(Rails)

    begin
      f = input.respond_to?(:readline) ? input : File.open(input, "r:#{options[:file_encoding]}")

      if (options[:force_utf8] || options[:file_encoding] =~ /utf-8/i) && ( f.respond_to?(:external_encoding) && f.external_encoding != Encoding.find('UTF-8') || f.respond_to?(:encoding) && f.encoding != Encoding.find('UTF-8') )
```
