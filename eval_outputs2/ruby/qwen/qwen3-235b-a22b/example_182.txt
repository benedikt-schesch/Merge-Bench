The merge conflict occurs in the definition of the `get_page` method, with two different versions:

- `def get_page(target_url)`: a positional argument, implying the target URL is required, as reflected in the docstring: `@param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page`.
- `def get_page(target_url: nil)`: a keyword argument with an optional `nil` default, suggesting a possible intention to evolve the API or allow alternate usage.

### Semantics and Intent

Analyzing the intent from both sides:

- **HEAD (`target_url` as positional):** This is the original form, and the presence of a parameter description in the comment indicates that the `target_url` is required. The method uses this parameter immediately to perform the HTTP request, and passing `nil` here would likely raise an error, unless there is additional handling elsewhere.
  
- **d26f64b (`target_url` as optional keyword):** The introduction of `nil` as a default suggests that the developer may have intended backward compatibility, or possibly a change to allow for default or alternative logic. However, without additional code handling a missing `target_url`, this could introduce runtime issues if called without one.

Given that the method's comment explicitly states that the `target_url` is required and it's used directly in the HTTP request, the version declaring it as a required positional argument better reflects the method's purpose and current implementation logic.

### Final Resolution

The correct semantic merge would be to preserve the HEAD version, which aligns with the documented intent and immediate usage of the parameter.

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of IpAddressInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of IpAddressInstance
                def get_page(target_url)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return IpAddressPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
