The merge conflict arises from differing intentions regarding the `PRE` constant in the versioning. The `HEAD` branch sets it to `'rc3'`, indicating a release candidate, while the other branch sets it to `nil`, implying a stable release. However, the surrounding context and code structure (e.g., the `to_s` method using `.compact`) indicate that the presence of `PRE` modifies the version output by including a pre-release identifier only when it's non-`nil`. This means that both settings are valid depending on the branch's versioning strategy.

Given the ambiguity in the semantic intents—whether the merged result should present a release candidate (via `'rc3'`) or a stable version (via `nil`)—**no confident resolution can be made** without explicit clarification.

The original code's version logic is intact and context-preserving, and the semantic interpretation remains unclear at this point. As per the guidelines, when the intent is ambiguous, the conflict remains unaltered.
