The given merge conflict arises in a Ruby class definition, centered around the `attr_reader :role_symbols` declaration and a conditional Rails 3 compatibility setup.

---

The key portion of the code being evaluated is as follows:

```ruby
  attr_reader :role_symbols
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
>>>>>>> 1bc1a86db3ca5e00b733330d7a1404ae6edd30df
  if Rails.version < '4'
```

Because the code between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`, as well as between `=======` and `>>>>>>> 1bc1a86db3ca5e00b733330d7a1404ae6edd30df`, is empty, there is insufficient information to determine the intended outcome of the merge. This could represent:
- One side trying to insert a line of code,
- One side trying to delete or remove a line,
- Or both sides intentionally leaving the area blank.

However, without content in these blocks, the exact intent of both branches remains ambiguous.

---

Given the requirement to preserve the original context entirely and only resolve the conflict *if and when the intent is clear*, we must return the code with the unresolved conflict markers still in place.

---

Here is the entire original code snippet with the unresolved conflict preserved:

```ruby
  belongs_to :branch
  belongs_to :company
  has_many :test_attr_throughs
  has_many :test_model_security_model_with_finds
  attr_reader :role_symbols
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
>>>>>>> 1bc1a86db3ca5e00b733330d7a1404ae6edd30df
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :test_model, :test_another_model, :attr, :branch, :company, :test_attr,
  	  :test_a_third_model, :n_way_join_item, :n_way_join_item_id, :test_attr_through_id, 
  	  :test_model_id, :test_another_model_id
  end
```
