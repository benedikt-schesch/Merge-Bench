The provided code snippet features a merge conflict centered around two divergent lines that modify different instance variables (`@join_parts` and `@joins`). Without further top-level context (e.g., how `@join_parts` and `@joins` are used elsewhere in the system, or details around the intent of each branch), it is ambiguous which instance variable is semantically appropriate for storing the association post-merge.

Since the intent and semantics of the code branches cannot be conclusively determined from the snippet provided, the resolution should preserve the original merge conflict to alert developers that manual intervention is required.

Here is the code snippet, returned in full, without modification to the context or spacing:

```ruby
            association = PolymorphicJoinAssociation.new(reflection, self, klass, parent)
          else
            association = build_join_association(reflection, parent)
          end
          association.join_type = join_type
<<<<<<< HEAD
          @join_parts << association
=======
          @joins << association
>>>>>>> 5df8ae16e28501c35b5681da6563eba6bff0ffb6
          cache_joined_association(association)
        end
        association
      else
        build_without_metawhere(associations, parent, join_type)
