Here is the resolved code snippet based on the semantics and intent behind the merge conflict:

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of MessageInteractionInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of MessageInteractionInstance
                def get_page(target_url)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return MessageInteractionPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```

### Explanation:

- **Intent**: Both versions of the method aim to define a function that retrieves a page of results based on a provided URL. `target_url` is a fundamental argument for the `GET` request and is **required**.
- **Semantics**: The conflicting change (`target_url: nil`) introduces the possibility of an invalid, `nil` URL, which would result in an API error. Since the rest of the method depends on a valid `target_url`, making it optional (`nil`) is semantically incorrect.
- **Consistency**: The original positional argument (`target_url`) aligns directly with the usage in the method body and is consistent with typical REST API client design where resource URLs are mandatory.

Therefore, the `HEAD` branch's version is semantically sound and should be preserved.
