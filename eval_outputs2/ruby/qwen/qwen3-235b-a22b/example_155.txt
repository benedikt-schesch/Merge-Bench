Here is the resolved code snippet with semantic conflict resolution applied. The core resolution decision centers on maintaining the original method signature, because the parameter `target_url` is essential for the method to function correctly (used directly in the request), and making it a keyword argument with a default of `nil` introduces ambiguity and potential runtime errors:

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of CommandInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of CommandInstance
          def get_page(target_url)
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return CommandPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```

### Explanation

- **Semantic Intent**: The method `get_page` relies on `target_url` being provided. It is immediately used to make a network request; allowing it to default to `nil` would lead to an invalid API call. Therefore, `target_url` should not have a default value.
- **Parameter Type Change**: Changing the parameter to a keyword argument would change the method's interface. If other parts of the system expect a positional argument, this could break calling code unless all usages are manually updated.
- **Stability**: Keeping the original parameter signature maintains backward compatibility and guarantees that the required data is always present when the method is invoked.
