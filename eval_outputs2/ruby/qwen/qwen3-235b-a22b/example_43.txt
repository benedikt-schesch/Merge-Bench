The resolution of this merge conflict depends on the intended scope and usage of the `uniform` method within the `Ai4r::NeuralNetwork::WeightInitializations` module.

Both versions of the method share identical implementation logic:

```ruby
->(_n, _i, _j) { rand * 2 - 1 }
```

This indicates that the functional intent behind the method has not changed—both sides aim to return a Proc object that generates a random number in the range \[-1, 1) for weight initialization.

However, there is a semantic difference in how the method is defined:

- `HEAD` defines it as an **instance method** (`def uniform`).
- The merge commit defines it as a **class/module method** (`def self.uniform`) and includes a documentation comment describing its return type.

To choose one version without additional context could introduce semantic inconsistencies depending on:
- Whether the module is `include`d (which makes these instance methods available), or `extend`ed (which makes them module-level class methods).
- How the rest of the codebase expects to call `uniform`—on an instance or on the module directly.
- Whether downstream code may have relied on the prior behavior.

Since both versions serve coherent, but potentially conflicting, semantic purposes and no existing usage or documentation conventions are provided to resolve this ambiguity, we preserve the conflict markers as required to flag it for developer review.
