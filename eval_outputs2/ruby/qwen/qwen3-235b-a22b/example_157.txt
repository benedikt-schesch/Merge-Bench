Here's the code snippet with the merge conflict preserved according to the instructions. The resolution of the conflict is ambiguous based on the provided context, since both versions differ only in how they declare the method signature:

- **HEAD (`def get_page(target_url)`)**: Requires a single positional argument `target_url`.
- **d26f64b (`def get_page(target_url: nil)`)**: Uses a keyword argument with a default `nil`. This would change method invocation from positional to keyword style and introduce an invalid default, which contradicts the semantic intent that `target_url` should be a required string.

If the goal was to maintain backward compatibility while modernizing syntax, one might prefer using a required keyword argument like `def get_page(target_url:)`.

However, as instructed, the full snippet is returned **without changes**, because the intent isn't entirely clear.

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of ConnectAppInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of ConnectAppInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD
            def get_page(target_url)

            def get_page(target_url: nil)

              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return ConnectAppPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
