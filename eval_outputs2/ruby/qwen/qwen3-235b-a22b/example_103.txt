```ruby
          :model => nil,
          :nested_in  => nil,
          :strong_parameters => nil
        }.merge(options)
        options.merge!({ :strong_parameters => true }) if Rails.version >= '4' && options[:strong_parameters] == nil
        options.merge!({ :strong_parameters => false }) if Rails.version < '4' && options[:strong_parameters] == nil

        new_actions = actions_from_option( options[:new] ).merge(
            actions_from_option(options[:additional_new]) )
        members = actions_from_option(options[:member]).merge(
            actions_from_option(options[:additional_member]))

``` 

The intent of both conflicting changes appears to be to establish a default value for the `:strong_parameters` option based on the Rails version.  
- The line from `HEAD` (the current branch): Ensures `:strong_parameters` is explicitly set to `true` for Rails 4 and above if no other value was provided.  
- The line from `1bc1a86db3ca5e00b733330d7a1404ae6edd30df` (the incoming branch): Ensures `:strong_parameters` is explicitly set to `false` for Rails 3 and below if no other value was provided.

These two changes are complementary â€” they cover both sides of the version check and are not semantically conflicting. The resolved version merges this intent by keeping both checks in sequence:

- First, set to `true` if Rails is version 4 or higher.
- Second, set to `false` if Rails is version less than 4 (and was not already set in the previous step).  

This correctly sets a default value depending on the Rails version and aligns with both sides' intent to handle strong parameters based on the Rails version.
