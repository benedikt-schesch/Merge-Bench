Here is the conflict resolved by preserving the original positional argument since the `target_url` parameter is essential and has no valid default, as implied by the comment and method functionality:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of LocalInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of LocalInstance
              def get_page(target_url)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return LocalPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
