The code provides a clear comment explaining the need to "Silence Rails 4 deprecation warnings in test suite". However, in **both sides of the merge conflict**, the code to silence deprecation is **commented out**, thus not fulfilling the stated intent.

One branch has:

```ruby
if Rails.version >= '4'
#  ActiveSupport::Deprecation.silenced = true
end
```

The other has:

```ruby
# if Rails.version >= '4'
#   ActiveSupport::Deprecation.silenced = true
# end
```

So, although the purpose is well-defined in the comment, **both versions effectively do not silence the deprecations**, and instead introduce different commenting strategies.

Because **resolving the merge conflict requires choosing between two code paths that both fail to meet the original intent**, and it is **unclear whether the silence directive should now be restored or left commented out intentionally**, this situation qualifies as **ambiguous intent**.

Therefore, and per the user's instruction, the appropriate resolution is to **return the original conflicting code in full context**, unchanged apart from wrapping in a code block as needed.
