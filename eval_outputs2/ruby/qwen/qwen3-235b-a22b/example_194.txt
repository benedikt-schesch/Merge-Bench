The conflict in this code involves a change in the method signature for `get_page`. One version maintains a standard positional parameter: `def get_page(target_url)`, while the other introduces a keyword argument with a default of `nil`: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`.

To assess which version should persist, we observe how the method is implemented:

```ruby
response = @version.domain.request(
    'GET',
    target_url
)
```

This means that the method expects a defined `target_url`â€”it is directly used in a request. Making `target_url` optional by setting a default of `nil` could introduce a runtime error (a `nil` URL in an HTTP request is indeed invalid and likely unusable), unless further handling is implemented elsewhere, which is not visible in this snippet.

### Semantic Interpretation:
- The original version (HEAD): `def get_page(target_url)` ensures that consumers **must** provide a `target_url`, enforcing contract integrity.
- The incoming change attempts to allow an optional parameter, which may indicate an intent to supply a default elsewhere or allow backward compatibility, but with no such logic visible in the snippet.

Since the code requires a valid `target_url` and there is no internal fallback logic shown to handle a nil value safely, the **positional argument** that guarantees a provided `target_url` is semantically correct for the behavior of the method.

### Resolution:
We preserve the original method signature and remove the merge conflict markers accordingly.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of OriginationUrlInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of OriginationUrlInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return OriginationUrlPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
