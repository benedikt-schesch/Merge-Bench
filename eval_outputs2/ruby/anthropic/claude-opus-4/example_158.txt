Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD**: Defines `get_page` with `target_url` as a positional parameter
- **Incoming change**: Defines `get_page` with `target_url` as a keyword parameter with a default value of `nil`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want the same method that retrieves a page of results
- The incoming change is modernizing the method signature to use keyword arguments (a Ruby best practice)
- The default value of `nil` suggests the parameter might be optional

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly in the request without any nil checking, and the comment indicates this is for an "API-generated URL", it seems the parameter is actually required. The keyword argument approach is better Ruby style, but the `nil` default might be incorrect.

However, without more context about how this method is called throughout the codebase, I cannot be certain whether the parameter should be optional or required. The safest approach is to preserve the conflict for human review.

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of AddOnResultInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of AddOnResultInstance

                )
                return AddOnResultPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
