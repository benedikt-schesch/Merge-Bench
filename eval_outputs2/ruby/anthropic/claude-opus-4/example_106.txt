Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle Rails 4+ compatibility, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD side**: Uses `self.klass.all(@finder_options)` with a debug `puts` statement
- **Other side**: Uses a more explicit chain of `joins`, `includes`, and `where` with specific finder options

The intent appears to be migrating from the deprecated `all` method with options (which was removed in Rails 4) to the newer ActiveRecord query interface. The other side's approach is more correct for Rails 4+ as it properly separates the different query components.

Here's the resolved conflict, keeping the more appropriate Rails 4+ implementation:

```ruby
        self
      elsif Rails.version < "4"
        # for Rails < 4: use scoped method
        self.klass.scoped(@finder_options)
      else
        # TODO Refactor this.  There is certainly a better way.
        self.klass.joins(@finder_options[:joins]).includes(@finder_options[:include]).where(@finder_options[:conditions])
      end
    end

    # Consumes the given obligation, converting it into scope join and condition options.
    def parse!( obligation )

```
