Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to calculate distances between data points, but they have different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Uses a direct call to `distance(data, train_item)`
- **Other branch**: Introduces a configurable distance function through `@distance_function`, falling back to the `distance` method if not specified

The semantic intent of the other branch is to make the distance calculation more flexible by allowing users to specify a custom distance function. This is a common pattern in machine learning libraries and appears to be a legitimate enhancement.

Here's the resolved conflict that preserves the flexibility introduced in the other branch:

```ruby
      #
      # Evaluation does not update internal statistics, keeping the
      # classifier state unchanged. Use +update_with_instance+ to
      # incorporate new samples.
      def eval(data)
        metric = @distance_function || method(:distance)
        neighbors = @data_set.data_items.map do |train_item|
          [metric.call(data, train_item), train_item.last]
        end
        neighbors.sort_by! { |d, _| d }
        k_limit = [@k, @data_set.data_items.length].min
        k_neighbors = neighbors.first(k_limit)


```
