Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - defining a `get_page` method that retrieves a page of records. The only difference is in the method signature:

- HEAD version: `def get_page(target_url)`
- Other version: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

The semantic difference is that the HEAD version uses a positional parameter while the other version uses a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`.

Given that the method body uses `target_url` directly in the request without any nil checking, and considering Ruby conventions where keyword arguments are often preferred for clarity and flexibility, I'll resolve this by keeping the keyword argument version:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of LocalInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of LocalInstance
              def get_page(target_url: nil)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return LocalPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
