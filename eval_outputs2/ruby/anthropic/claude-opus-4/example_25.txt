Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the schema version in an ActiveRecord schema file. The HEAD has version `20110308233449` while the incoming change has version `20110512144542`.

Based on the timestamp format (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS), the incoming change (20110512144542 - May 12, 2011) is more recent than HEAD (20110308233449 - March 8, 2011). In Rails schema files, we typically want to keep the most recent migration version since it represents the latest state of the database schema.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```ruby
# all the migrations from scratch. The latter is a flawed and unsustainable approach (the more migrations
# you'll amass, the slower it'll run and the greater likelihood for issues).
#
# It's strongly recommended to check this file into your version control system.

ActiveRecord::Schema.define(:version => 20110512144542) do

  create_table "configuration_parameters", :force => true do |t|
    t.string   "name"
    t.string   "value"
    t.integer  "project_id"
```
