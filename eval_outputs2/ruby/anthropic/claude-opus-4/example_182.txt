Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD**: Has a method signature `def get_page(target_url)` with a positional parameter
- **Other branch**: Has a method signature `def get_page(target_url: nil)` with a keyword parameter with a default value

The semantic intent appears to be:
- The HEAD branch expects `target_url` as a required positional argument
- The other branch wants to make `target_url` an optional keyword argument

Looking at the method body, `target_url` is passed directly to `@version.domain.request()`, which suggests it's likely required for the functionality to work properly. However, the other branch's intent to use keyword arguments might be part of a broader refactoring effort to standardize the API.

Since I cannot determine with certainty whether:
1. The `nil` default is meaningful (perhaps there's other code that handles nil values)
2. This is part of a larger refactoring to keyword arguments
3. Whether the positional vs keyword argument change would break existing callers

I should return the conflict as-is:

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of IpAddressInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of IpAddressInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD
                def get_page(target_url)

                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return IpAddressPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
