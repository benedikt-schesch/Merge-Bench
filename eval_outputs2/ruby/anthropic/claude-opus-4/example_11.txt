Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar goals with slight differences:

1. **HEAD side**: Uses `sadd("processes", key)` and `exists(key)`
2. **Other side**: Uses `sadd("processes", [key])` and `exists?(key)`

The semantic differences are:
- `sadd` can accept either a single value or an array. Both `key` and `[key]` will work the same way for adding a single element.
- `exists` vs `exists?` - In recent versions of Redis gems, `exists?` is the preferred method as it returns a boolean, while `exists` returns an integer (0 or 1).

Based on Redis gem best practices and the intent to check existence, the resolution should use `exists?` for cleaner boolean semantics, while for `sadd`, both forms are functionally equivalent, so we can keep the simpler form without the array wrapper.

```ruby
        fails = procd = 0
        kb = memory_usage(::Process.pid)

        _, exists, _, _, msg = redis { |conn|
          conn.multi { |transaction|
            transaction.sadd("processes", key)
            transaction.exists?(key)
            transaction.hmset(key, "info", to_json,
              "busy", curstate.size,
              "beat", Time.now.to_f,
              "rtt_us", rtt,
              "quiet", @done.to_s,
