Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - checking if Rails version is less than 4. The only differences are:

1. HEAD uses double quotes (`"4"`) while the other branch uses single quotes (`'4'`)
2. The other branch has an extra blank line before the if statement

Since both accomplish the same semantic goal and Ruby treats single and double quotes equivalently for this simple string, I'll choose the cleaner version without the extra blank line and with single quotes (which is often preferred in Ruby for simple strings).

```ruby
end
class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  has_many :branches
  belongs_to :country
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :name, :country, :country_id
  end
end
class SmallCompany < Company
  def self.decl_auth_context

```
