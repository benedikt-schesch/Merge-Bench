Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they're testing that timestamps are approximately equal to expected values. The only difference is the syntax used:

- HEAD uses `be_close(expected, tolerance)` with a tolerance of 5 seconds
- The incoming change uses `be_within(tolerance).of(expected)` with a tolerance of 1 second

The `be_within` syntax appears to be the newer RSpec matcher syntax (replacing the deprecated `be_close`), and the tolerance has been tightened from 5 seconds to 1 second, which seems reasonable for this test.

Here's the resolved conflict, using the newer syntax:

```ruby
      upload = Factory.create :upload
      comment = Factory.create :comment, :upload_ids => [upload.id.to_s],
        :body => "Can't touch this"
      Comment.update_all({:updated_at => 15.minutes.ago}, :id => comment.id)

      comment.reload.updated_at.should be_within(1).of(15.minutes.ago)
      upload.reload.destroy
      comment.reload.updated_at.should be_within(1).of(Time.now)
    end
  end
  
  context "hours" do
    it "assigns human hours" do

```
