Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same result - they both want to keep the `xavier` method implementation. The only difference is that one side (HEAD) has no blank line after the method declaration, while the other side has added a blank line.

Since both sides have the same functional code and the only difference is formatting (the presence or absence of a blank line), I'll resolve this by keeping the version without the extra blank line for consistency:

```ruby
        ->(_n, _i, _j) { rand * 2 - 1 }
      end

      # Xavier/Glorot initialization based on layer dimensions
      def xavier(structure)
        lambda do |layer, _i, _j|
          limit = Math.sqrt(6.0 / (structure[layer] + structure[layer + 1]))
          rand * 2 * limit - limit
        end
      end

```
