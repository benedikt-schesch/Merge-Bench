Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature of `get_page`. 

- HEAD version: `def get_page(target_url)`
- Incoming version: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

The semantic intent here appears to be:
- HEAD keeps the positional parameter
- The incoming change converts it to a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks or default handling, and the comment indicates this is for retrieving "a single page" from an "API-generated URL", it seems the `target_url` is required for this method to function properly.

The most semantically correct resolution would be to keep the positional parameter since the URL appears to be required, not optional.

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of FaxMediaInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of FaxMediaInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return FaxMediaPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
