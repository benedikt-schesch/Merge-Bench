Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Adds a `name_status` method that calls `cache_name_status`
- **Incoming change**: Removes the `name_status` method entirely

Without more context about the broader codebase changes, I cannot determine which approach is correct. The conflict represents a fundamental disagreement about whether this method should exist or not.

Since the intent is ambiguous and I cannot determine which side should take precedence, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```ruby
      @full_diff = nil
      @full_diff_files = nil
      @stats = nil
    end
    attr_reader :from, :to
<<<<<<< HEAD
   
    def name_status
      cache_name_status
    end
=======
>>>>>>> 69bae05cf5d4b3f27932c0c998e24da2af654682

    def path(path)
      @path = path
      return self
    end

```
