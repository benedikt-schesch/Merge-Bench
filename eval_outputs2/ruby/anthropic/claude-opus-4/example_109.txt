Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - checking if the Rails version is less than 4. The only difference is the style of quotes used:
- HEAD uses double quotes: `"4"`
- The incoming change uses single quotes: `'4'`

Since both versions are functionally identical in Ruby, I'll resolve this by keeping the single quotes version as it appears to be part of a broader standardization effort (given it's from a specific commit). Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
end

class TestModelSecurityModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  using_access_control

  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :attr, :attr_2, :test_attrs
  end
end
class TestModelSecurityModelWithFind < ActiveRecord::Base
  if Rails.version < "3.2"

```
