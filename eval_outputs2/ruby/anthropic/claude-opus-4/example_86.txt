Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to document the same method for drawing a cropped image, but they're using different naming conventions and parameter styles:

- HEAD uses `draw_image_cropped` with object-based parameters (`position`, `crop_position`, `crop_size`)
- The other branch uses `image_cropped` with individual numeric parameters (`x`, `y`, `crop_x`, `crop_y`, `crop_width`, `crop_height`)

Based on the context and the existing parameter documentation below the conflict (which lists individual numeric parameters), it appears the intent is to have a method that draws a cropped portion of an image. The parameter documentation that follows matches the style of the second approach with individual coordinates.

Here's the resolved version that aligns with the documented parameters:

```ruby
  # @return [nil]
  # @example Draw a duck within a game
  #   display.image(Image['images/duck.png'], 80, 80)
  # Draw an image at a position.

  # @!method image_cropped(image, x, y, crop_x, crop_y, crop_width, crop_height)
  # @param [Image] image to draw
  # @param [Numeric] x position
  # @param [Numeric] y position
  # @param [Numeric] x position of crop
  # @param [Numeric] y position of crop

```
