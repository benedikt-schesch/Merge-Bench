Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD has version `0.3.15` - this appears to be a stable release version
- The incoming change has version `0.4.0.beta2` - this is a beta/pre-release version of a new minor version

From a semantic versioning perspective, `0.4.0.beta2` is a higher version than `0.3.15`, even though it's a beta. The conflict likely arose because:
1. The HEAD branch continued with patch releases (0.3.x series)
2. Meanwhile, another branch was working on the next minor version (0.4.0) in beta

The intent appears to be moving forward to the new minor version that's in beta testing. Since `0.4.0.beta2` represents forward progress toward the next release, that should be the resolved version.

```ruby
module Dandelion
  VERSION = '0.4.0.beta2'
end
```
