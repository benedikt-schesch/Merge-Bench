Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to document a method for drawing an image, but with different method signatures:

- HEAD uses `draw_image(image, position)` with a position parameter
- The other branch uses `image(image, x, y)` with separate x and y parameters

However, the documentation below the conflict clearly shows:
- Parameters are listed as separate `x` and `y` values
- The method takes three parameters: image, x position, and y position

Since the parameter documentation matches the `image(image, x, y)` signature, this appears to be the correct method signature.

```ruby

  # @!method fill_shape
  # @return [nil]
  # Fill previously made shape.

  # @!method image(image, x, y)
  # @param [Image] image to draw
  # @param [Numeric] x position
  # @param [Numeric] y position
  # @return [nil]
  # @example Draw a duck within a game

```
