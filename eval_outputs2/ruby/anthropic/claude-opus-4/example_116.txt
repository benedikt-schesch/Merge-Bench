Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are testing the same functionality but using different RSpec matcher syntax:

- HEAD uses `should be false` (older RSpec syntax)
- The incoming change uses `should be_falsey` (newer RSpec syntax)

Since the second test below uses the same pattern and would need consistency, and considering that `be_falsey` is more semantically appropriate for testing truthiness rather than exact boolean values, I'll resolve this by using the newer syntax pattern:

```ruby
>>>>>>> 88e81a1828af3c87c3b3ef7563bc67326d6774d9
    end

    it 'marks color as unavailable' do
      STDOUT.stub(:tty?).and_return(false)
      Term.color?.should be_falsey
    end

    it 'marks color as available' do
      STDOUT.stub(:tty?).and_return(true)
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
