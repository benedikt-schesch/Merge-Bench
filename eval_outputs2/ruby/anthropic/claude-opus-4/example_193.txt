Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the `get_page` method signature:

- HEAD version: `def get_page(target_url)`
- Incoming change: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

The incoming change is converting the positional parameter to a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`. This is a common Ruby pattern for making APIs more explicit and flexible.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks or default handling, and the comment indicates this is for retrieving "a single page" from an "API-generated URL", it seems the `target_url` is required for this method to function properly.

However, the incoming change appears to be part of a broader refactoring to use keyword arguments (which is a Ruby best practice for method signatures with parameters). The conflict should be resolved by accepting the keyword argument syntax from the incoming change:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of NotificationInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of NotificationInstance
            def get_page(target_url: nil)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return NotificationPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
