Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature for `get_page`. The conflict is between:
- HEAD: `def get_page(target_url)`
- Incoming change: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

The incoming change is converting the positional parameter to a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`. This is a common Ruby pattern that makes the API more explicit and allows for optional parameters.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any checks for nil or default handling, and the comment indicates it takes a "target_url" parameter, it seems the intent is to make this parameter optional via keyword argument syntax while maintaining backward compatibility.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of DayInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of DayInstance
            def get_page(target_url: nil)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return DayPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
