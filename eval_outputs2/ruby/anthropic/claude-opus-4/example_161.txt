Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same method `get_page`, but with different parameter signatures:

- HEAD version: `def get_page(target_url)`
- Incoming version: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

The semantic difference is that the incoming version is using a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`, while the HEAD version uses a positional argument.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks or default handling, and the docstring indicates that `target_url` is expected to be an "API-generated URL", it seems the intent is that this parameter should be required, not optional.

The keyword argument syntax with `nil` default would make the parameter optional, which doesn't align with the documented behavior and usage within the method.

Therefore, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of CredentialListInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of CredentialListInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return CredentialListPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
