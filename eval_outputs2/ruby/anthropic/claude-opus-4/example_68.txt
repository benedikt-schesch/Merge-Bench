Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different test cases to what appears to be a test file. The HEAD side is adding a test about creating and updating a repo, while the incoming change is adding a context block for testing when a directory exists but is empty.

These changes appear to be additive and non-conflicting in terms of intent - they're testing different aspects of the functionality. The conflict is purely structural because both sides are adding content at the same location.

Here's the resolved version that includes both test cases:

```ruby
      let(:path) { '/does/not/exist' }

      it { expect(subject.exists?(path)).to be(false) }
    end

    it "should create the repo, then update it given multiple successive calls." do
      expect_update_to_clone_repo!
      subject.update!(quiet: false)
      expect(File.directory?(mocked_user_path)).to be true
    end

    context "when the directory does exist" do
      context "but is empty" do
        let(:path) { Fixtures.join('empty_dir') }

        before { FileUtils.mkdir(path) }

        it { expect(subject.exists?(path)).to be(false) }
