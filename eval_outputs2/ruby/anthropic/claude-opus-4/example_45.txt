Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides of the merge are trying to achieve the same thing. The only difference is that the HEAD version has a blank line after the opening of the `map` block, while the incoming change has two blank lines before the `neighbors = ` assignment.

Since both versions have identical functional code and the semantic intent is the same, I'll resolve this by keeping the cleaner version without the extra blank lines:

```ruby
      #
      # Evaluation does not update internal statistics, keeping the
      # classifier state unchanged. Use +update_with_instance+ to
      # incorporate new samples.
      def eval(data)
        neighbors = @data_set.data_items.map do |train_item|
          [distance(data, train_item), train_item.last]
        end
        neighbors.sort_by! { |d, _| d }
        k_limit = [@k, @data_set.data_items.length].min
        k_neighbors = neighbors.first(k_limit)


```
