Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same `get_page` method, but with different parameter syntax:

- **HEAD**: Uses positional parameter syntax `def get_page(target_url)`
- **Branch d26f64b**: Uses keyword argument syntax `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both want a method that retrieves a page given a target URL. The difference is in the calling convention. The keyword argument version with a default of `nil` suggests it might be called without arguments in some cases, while the positional parameter version requires the argument.

Given that the method body uses `target_url` directly in the request without any nil-checking, and this appears to be retrieving a specific page from an API-generated URL, the positional parameter version (HEAD) seems more appropriate as it enforces that a URL must be provided.

Here's the resolved version:

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of PayloadInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of PayloadInstance
                def get_page(target_url)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return PayloadPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
