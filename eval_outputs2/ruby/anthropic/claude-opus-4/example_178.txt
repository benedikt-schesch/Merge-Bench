Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same `get_page` method, but with different parameter syntax:

- HEAD version: `def get_page(target_url)` - uses positional parameter
- Incoming version: `def get_page(target_url: nil)` - uses keyword parameter with default value

The semantic intent appears to be to make the `target_url` parameter a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`. This is a common Ruby pattern that makes the API more explicit and allows for optional parameters.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks or conditional logic, and given that this appears to be retrieving a page from an API-generated URL, the keyword argument approach with a nil default seems to be the intended improvement.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of InviteInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of InviteInstance
              def get_page(target_url: nil)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return InvitePage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
