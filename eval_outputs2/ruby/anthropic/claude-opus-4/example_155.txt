Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature for `get_page`. 

The HEAD version has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url)
```

The incoming change has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url: nil)
```

The key difference is that the incoming change is converting the positional parameter to a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`. This is a common Ruby pattern that provides more flexibility and clarity in method calls.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks or conditional logic, and the comment indicates this is for retrieving "a single page" from an "API-generated URL", it seems the `target_url` is actually required for this method to function properly.

Given this context, the HEAD version (positional parameter without default) appears to be the correct choice as it better represents the semantic intent that `target_url` is a required parameter.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of CommandInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of CommandInstance
          def get_page(target_url)
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return CommandPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
