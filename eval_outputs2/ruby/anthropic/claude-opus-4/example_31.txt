Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to maintain the same `UNSAFE_ATTRIBUTES_FOR_SERIALIZATION` constant. The conflict appears to be about adding deprecation handling for an old constant name.

The HEAD side has just the constant definition, while the incoming changes add deprecation support for the old `BLACKLIST_FOR_SERIALIZATION` constant name, which is being renamed to `UNSAFE_ATTRIBUTES_FOR_SERIALIZATION` (likely for more inclusive language).

The semantic intent is clear: both sides want the same constant, and the incoming side additionally wants to provide backwards compatibility with a deprecation warning for the old name. This is a common pattern when renaming constants in a library.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```ruby
      UNSAFE_ATTRIBUTES_FOR_SERIALIZATION = [:encrypted_password, :reset_password_token, :reset_password_sent_at,
        :remember_created_at, :sign_in_count, :current_sign_in_at, :last_sign_in_at, :current_sign_in_ip,
        :last_sign_in_ip, :password_salt, :confirmation_token, :confirmed_at, :confirmation_sent_at,
        :remember_token, :unconfirmed_email, :failed_attempts, :unlock_token, :locked_at]

      include Devise::DeprecatedConstantAccessor
      deprecate_constant "BLACKLIST_FOR_SERIALIZATION", "Devise::Models::Authenticatable::UNSAFE_ATTRIBUTES_FOR_SERIALIZATION", deprecator: Devise.deprecator

      included do
        class_attribute :devise_modules, instance_writer: false
        self.devise_modules ||= []

        before_validation :downcase_keys
