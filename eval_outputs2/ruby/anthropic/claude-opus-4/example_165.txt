Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same method `get_page`, but with different parameter signatures:

- HEAD version: `def get_page(target_url)` - uses positional parameter
- Incoming version: `def get_page(target_url: nil)` - uses keyword parameter with default value

Given the context and Ruby conventions, the incoming change appears to be modernizing the method signature to use keyword arguments, which is a common Ruby best practice. The default value of `nil` also suggests this might be part of making the API more flexible.

Since both versions have the same intent (defining a method to retrieve a page using a target URL), and the keyword argument version is more flexible and follows modern Ruby conventions, I'll resolve this by keeping the incoming change:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of DependentPhoneNumberInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of DependentPhoneNumberInstance
              def get_page(target_url: nil)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return DependentPhoneNumberPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
