Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature for `get_page`. 

The HEAD version has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url)
```

The incoming change has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url: nil)
```

The semantic intent here is clear: the incoming change is converting the positional parameter `target_url` to a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`. This is a common Ruby pattern that makes the API more explicit and allows for optional parameters.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any modifications, and keyword arguments are generally preferred in modern Ruby for clarity, the resolution should accept the incoming change.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of InstalledAddOnInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of InstalledAddOnInstance
          def get_page(target_url: nil)
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return InstalledAddOnPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
