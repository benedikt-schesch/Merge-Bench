Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call the `@page.call` method, but they differ in whether to pass an empty hash as an argument:

- HEAD version: `response = @page.call`
- The other branch: `response = @page.call({})`

Given the context of this being a test file for what appears to be a Rack middleware (Rack::Facebook), and looking at the pattern in the surrounding code, the most likely intent is that `@page.call` expects an environment hash as a parameter (which is standard for Rack applications).

The conflict seems to be about whether to explicitly pass an empty hash or rely on a default parameter. Since this is testing the "skips with false condition" scenario, and the test name suggests we're testing behavior when the condition is false (meaning the Facebook middleware should be skipped), passing an empty environment hash explicitly makes the test's intent clearer.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
    assert_equal 400, response.status
  end
  
  def test_skips_with_false_condition
    @facebook = Rack::Facebook.new(@app) { false }
    response = @page.call({})
    assert_equal 200, response.status
  end
  
  def test_skips_with_true_condition_without_fb_sig
    @facebook = Rack::Facebook.new(@app) { true }
```
