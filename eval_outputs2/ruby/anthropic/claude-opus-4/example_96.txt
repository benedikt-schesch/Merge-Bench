Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

**HEAD version:**
- Sets `img_opts` to a new hash with title, alt, and class, then merges the passed-in `img_opts`
- This means passed-in options will override the defaults

**Other version:**
- Merges the defaults into `img_opts`, then merges `img_opts` again (which is redundant)
- The double merge of `img_opts` appears to be a mistake

Both versions want the passed-in `img_opts` to take precedence over the defaults, but HEAD's approach is cleaner and more straightforward. The other version's double merge is unnecessary and confusing.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```ruby
module ProfilesHelper
  include Avatar::View::ActionViewSupport
  
  def icon profile, size = :small, img_opts = {}
    return "" if profile.nil?
    img_opts = {:title => profile.full_name, :alt => profile.full_name, :class => size}.merge(img_opts)
    link_to(avatar_tag(profile, {:size => size, :file_column_version => size}, img_opts))
  end
  
  def location_link profile = @p
    return profile.location if profile.location == Profile::NOWHERE
    link_to h(profile.location), search_profiles_path.add_param('search[location]' => profile.location)

```
