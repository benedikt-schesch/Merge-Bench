Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they have identical code. The only difference appears to be trailing whitespace on the branch version (3e5c37308ee51d35b9fae438da419cb40770a95b) which has extra spaces at the end of the line.

Since both sides have the same semantic intent and identical functionality, I'll resolve this by taking the cleaner version without trailing whitespace:

```ruby
    def attempt_to_load(klass)
       klass.constantize
    end

    def self.db_time_now
      (ActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone == :utc) ? Time.now.utc : Time.now
    end

    protected

    def before_save

```
