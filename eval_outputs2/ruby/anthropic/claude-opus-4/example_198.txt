Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same `get_page` method, but with different parameter styles:

- HEAD side: `def get_page(target_url)` - uses positional parameter
- Other side: `def get_page(target_url: nil)` - uses keyword parameter with default value

The semantics indicate that the other side is trying to make the parameter optional by providing a default value of `nil` and using Ruby's keyword argument syntax. This is likely an API improvement to make the method more flexible.

Since the method body shows that `target_url` is used directly in the request without any nil checking, and this appears to be retrieving a specific page from a paginated API response, the intent seems to be that `target_url` should actually be required. The positional parameter style from HEAD better reflects this requirement.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of PhoneNumberInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of PhoneNumberInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return PhoneNumberPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
