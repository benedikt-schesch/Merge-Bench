Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to require the same three files, but with different path specifications:

- HEAD is using `File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/lib/...'` which provides an explicit path relative to the current file
- The other branch is using simple require statements with just the file names

The semantic intent of both sides is the same - to require these three files. The difference is in how they specify the paths. The more explicit path approach (HEAD) is generally more reliable as it doesn't depend on Ruby's load path configuration, while the simpler approach assumes these files are in Ruby's load path.

Given that this appears to be a library initialization file and both approaches aim to achieve the same result, I'll preserve the more explicit path approach from HEAD as it's more robust:

```ruby
require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/lib/acts_as_follower'
require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/lib/acts_as_followable'
require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/lib/follow'

ActiveRecord::Base.send(:include, ActiveRecord::Acts::Follower)
ActiveRecord::Base.send(:include, ActiveRecord::Acts::Followable)
```
