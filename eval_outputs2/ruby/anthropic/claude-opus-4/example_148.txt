Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD**: Uses positional parameter syntax `def get_page(target_url)`
- **Incoming change**: Uses keyword argument syntax `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

The conflict appears to be about method signature style. The incoming change is trying to modernize the method signature to use keyword arguments (a Ruby best practice for better clarity and flexibility), while also providing a default value of `nil`.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks or default behavior, and this appears to be an API client method where the URL is likely required, the most semantically correct resolution would be to use keyword arguments but make it required (without the default value).

However, since I cannot be certain about the broader codebase conventions or whether `nil` is actually a valid value that triggers some default behavior elsewhere, I should return the conflict as-is:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of AuthorizedConnectAppInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of AuthorizedConnectAppInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD

              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return AuthorizedConnectAppPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
