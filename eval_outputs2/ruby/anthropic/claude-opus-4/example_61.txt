Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

1. **HEAD (current branch)**: Adds a new `optional_parts` method and a `protected` visibility modifier
2. **Incoming branch**: Removes/doesn't have these additions

From a semantic perspective, the HEAD branch is trying to:
- Add functionality to expose optional parts of a route
- Mark the following methods as protected (likely `base_arguments` and `parts_table`)

The incoming branch appears to have the original code without these additions.

Since the `optional_parts` method seems to be a logical companion to `required_parts` (providing complementary functionality), and the `protected` modifier is establishing proper encapsulation for the methods that follow, the semantic intent appears to be to enhance the class with additional functionality and better access control.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby

    def required_parts
      route.required_parts
    end

    def optional_parts
      route.path.optional_names
    end

    protected

    def base_arguments
      @base_arguments ||= [parts_table, serialize(spec, parent_spec)]
    end

    def parts_table

```
