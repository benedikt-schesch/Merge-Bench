```ruby
module Delayed

  class DeserializationError < StandardError
  end

  class Job < ActiveRecord::Base   
    MAX_ATTEMPTS = 25   
    set_table_name :delayed_jobs

    cattr_accessor :worker_name
    self.worker_name = "pid:#{Process.pid}"
  
```

The conflict resolution here is straightforward. The HEAD version has just the class declaration, while the other branch adds a `MAX_ATTEMPTS = 25` constant definition. Since both sides want the `Job` class to inherit from `ActiveRecord::Base` and the only difference is the addition of a constant, we can merge them by including both the class declaration and the constant definition. The trailing spaces after `ActiveRecord::Base` and `MAX_ATTEMPTS = 25` from the second branch are preserved as they were in the original.
