Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to check if the platform is Darwin (macOS), but using different approaches:

- HEAD uses: `RUBY_PLATFORM.downcase.include?("darwin")`
- The incoming change uses: `platform?("darwin")`

The incoming change appears to be using a more abstracted helper method `platform?` which is likely defined elsewhere in the codebase. This is generally a better practice as it encapsulates the platform detection logic and makes the code more maintainable.

Both sides have the same intent - to only run the test on Darwin/macOS platforms. The comment in the incoming change `# Only run test if it's darwin` confirms this intent.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
require File.expand_path('../../teststrap',__FILE__)

if platform?("darwin") # Only run test if it's darwin
  context "MacCore" do
    # Stub out the initialization
    setup do
      terminal = Object.new
      stub(terminal).windows { true }

```
