Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the same line of code that sends an email notification, but with different error handling approaches:

- HEAD version: Has `rescue assert(false)` - which will rescue any exceptions and call assert(false)
- The other branch: Has commented out the rescue clause with `# rescue assert(false)`

Given the context of the test (it's checking that an invitation should be deleted and no invitations should exist), and the next test is about "should not send an Invitation email", it seems the intent here is to verify that the email sending either:
1. Doesn't happen at all (and might raise an exception which should be handled)
2. Happens but we want to suppress any errors

Since the comment suggests someone intentionally disabled the rescue clause (rather than removing it entirely), I'll preserve the HEAD version which includes the active rescue clause, as it appears to be the more defensive/safe approach for a test that deals with deleted invitations.

```ruby
      invitation = @project.new_invitation(@inviter, :user_or_email => user.login)
      invitation.save
      invitation.deleted?.should == true
      user.invitations.length.should == 0
      
      Emailer.send_email(:project_membership_notification, invitation.id) rescue assert(false)
    end

    it "should not send an Invitation email to users in the inviter's organization" do
      user = Factory.create(:user)
      @project.organization.add_member(user, :participant)

```
