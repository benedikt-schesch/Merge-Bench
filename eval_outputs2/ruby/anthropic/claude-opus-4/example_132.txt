Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has no content between `module MetaSearch` and `module ModelCompatibility`, while the other branch (042d437) has added a blank line between these two module declarations.

This is a trivial formatting difference where one side added a blank line for readability. Since this doesn't affect functionality and is purely a stylistic choice, I'll resolve this by keeping the blank line as it improves code readability by separating the nested modules.

```ruby
module MetaSearch

  module ModelCompatibility

    def self.included(base)
      base.extend ClassMethods
    end

```
