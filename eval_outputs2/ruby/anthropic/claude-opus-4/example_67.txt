Looking at this merge conflict, I can see two different approaches to the `self.path` method:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Implements logic that checks if `USER_PATH` is a directory, gets git timestamps, and compares them (though the implementation is incomplete as it doesn't return anything)
- **Incoming changes**: Simply returns `DEFAULT_PATH`

The HEAD version appears to be implementing more complex logic for determining the path based on timestamps, while the incoming change simplifies it to just return a default path. Without seeing the complete implementation of the HEAD version (it seems cut off), it's ambiguous what the intended behavior should be.

Since the intent is unclear and the HEAD implementation appears incomplete, I'll return the snippet with the conflict markers intact:

```ruby
      #
      # @return [String]
      #   The path to the database directory.
      #
      def self.path
<<<<<<< HEAD
        if File.directory?(USER_PATH)
          t1 = Dir.chdir(USER_PATH) { Time.parse(`git log --date=iso8601 --pretty="%cd" -1`).utc }
          t2 = VENDORED_TIMESTAMP
=======
        DEFAULT_PATH
      end

      #
      # Tests whether the database exists.
      #
      # @param [String] path
```
