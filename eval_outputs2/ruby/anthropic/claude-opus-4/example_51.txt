Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle a blank line or comment after the `SPEC_ROOT` definition. The HEAD version has a completely blank line, while the other branch has a line with just a `#` comment marker.

Since both versions essentially serve the same purpose (providing visual separation between the `SPEC_ROOT` definition and the subsequent require statements), and the semantic intent is the same, I'll resolve this by choosing the simpler HEAD version with just the blank line:

```ruby
# Configure Rails Envinronment
ENV["RAILS_ENV"] = "test"
# # require File.expand_path("../internal/config/environment.rb",  __FILE__)
SPEC_ROOT = File.dirname(__FILE__)

require 'rubygems'
require 'bundler/setup'

require 'combustion'
```
