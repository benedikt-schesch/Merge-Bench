Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to add an autoload for CSV while the other branch appears to have removed or not included this line.

Given the context of the code (which appears to be setting up autoloads for a SciRuby library), and considering that:
1. The pattern follows the existing autoload for Shoes
2. CSV is a common data format that would make sense in a scientific Ruby library
3. The HEAD branch is actively adding this functionality

The intent seems to be to add CSV support to the library. The conflict likely arose because one branch added this feature while another branch was working on different changes.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```ruby
  autoload(:Validation, File.join(DIR, 'sciruby', 'validation'))
  autoload(:Data, File.join(DIR, 'sciruby', 'data'))
end

autoload(:Shoes, File.join(SciRuby::DIR, 'ext', 'shoes'))
autoload(:CSV, File.join(SciRuby::DIR, 'ext', 'csv'))

```
