Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the only difference between the two versions is that the HEAD version has no blank line after the comment block, while the other branch (08ab5310c30a528313f03790c68868941ad26101) has added a blank line between the comment and the method definition.

This is a stylistic difference where one side prefers to have spacing between the comment block and the method definition. Since this is a minor formatting preference and doesn't affect functionality, I'll resolve this by keeping the blank line as it improves readability by providing visual separation between the documentation comment and the code.

```ruby
      # The Hamming distance between two attributes vectors of equal 
      # length is the number of attributes for which the corresponding 
      # vectors are different
      # This distance function is frequently used with binary attributes,
      # though it can be used with other discrete attributes.

      def hamming_distance(a,b)
        count = 0
        a.each_index do |i|
          count += 1 if a[i] != b[i]
        end

```
