Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to improve the same method, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Changes the method from a module method to an instance method (removes `self.`)
- **Other branch**: Adds documentation comments (@param and @return tags) while keeping it as a module method

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. The HEAD branch wants this to be an instance method (possibly to be mixed into classes)
2. The other branch wants to add proper documentation

Since both changes are valuable and don't fundamentally conflict in intent, the best resolution is to combine both - keep the documentation AND make it an instance method:

```ruby
    # This module provides classical distance functions
    module Proximity
      
      # This is a faster computational replacement for eclidean distance.
      # Parameters a and b are vectors with continuous attributes.
      # @param a [Object]
      # @param b [Object]
      # @return [Object]
      def squared_euclidean_distance(a, b)
        sum = 0.0
        a.each_with_index do |item_a, i|
          item_b = b[i]
          sum += (item_a - item_b)**2
        end

```
