Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to add the same column `allowed_children_cache` to the `pages` table. The only difference is:

- HEAD includes a default value of empty string: `default: ''`
- The other branch adds the column without a default value

Since both sides want to add the same column and the code after the migration (`Page.find_each`) is updating all existing pages to populate this cache, having a default value of empty string seems reasonable and safer. It ensures that any new pages created will have a non-null value in this field.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```ruby
class AddAllowedChildrenCacheToPages < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    add_column :pages, :allowed_children_cache, :text, default: ''
    Page.reset_column_information
    Page.find_each do |page|
      page.save # update the allowed_children_cache
    end
  end

```
