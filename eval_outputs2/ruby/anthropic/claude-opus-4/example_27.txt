Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define routes, but using different Rails routing syntax:

- The HEAD side is using Rails 3+ routing syntax (`Www::Application.routes.draw do`)
- The incoming side is using Rails 2.x routing syntax (`ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|`)

The HEAD side appears to be the more modern version, and it already has route definitions that follow. The incoming side adds `map.resources :auth_sources` and some comments.

To resolve this semantically, I'll keep the modern Rails 3+ syntax from HEAD and incorporate the `:auth_sources` resource from the incoming changes:

```ruby
Www::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :auth_sources

  match '/' => 'projects#dashboard', :as => :home
  match ':controller/service.wsdl' => '#wsdl'

  resources :hosts

```
