Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

**HEAD (current branch):**
- Sets `@attachment` to `stringio_encode("")` if it's nil
- This suggests they want to encode an empty string in some specific way

**Incoming changes (5148eee4ba1b640f494ef4f9b6eb1c16ff8c50e3):**
- Sets `@attachment` to `StringIO.new('')` if it's nil
- Also adds a new `adapter` method that manages a connection

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to ensure `@attachment` has a default value when nil
- The incoming branch also adds new functionality (the adapter method)
- The main difference is `stringio_encode("")` vs `StringIO.new('')`

Without knowing what `stringio_encode` does exactly, I cannot definitively resolve whether it's a necessary encoding wrapper around StringIO or if it can be replaced. The safer approach is to preserve the conflict as-is.

```ruby
      json
    end

    def body(io=nil)
      @attachment = io unless io.nil?
<<<<<<< HEAD
      @attachment ||= stringio_encode("")
=======
      @attachment ||= StringIO.new('')
    end

    def adapter(connection=nil)
      @connection = connection unless connection.nil?
      @connection ||= Weary.adapter
>>>>>>> 5148eee4ba1b640f494ef4f9b6eb1c16ff8c50e3
    end

    def basic_auth(*credentials)
      if !credentials.empty?
        @basic_auth = true
