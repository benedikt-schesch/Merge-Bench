Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add the same dependencies but with different styling and one additional dependency on the HEAD side.

**HEAD side** has:
- Single quotes for the requires
- Includes `rexml/document`
- Three require statements

**Branch side** has:
- Double quotes for the requires (consistent with the earlier requires in the file)
- Does not include `rexml/document`
- Two require statements

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to add `rack-xslview` and `rack-docunext-content-length`
2. HEAD additionally wants to add `rexml/document`
3. The file uses double quotes as the standard (based on the earlier require statements)

Here's the resolved conflict, maintaining double quotes for consistency and including all three dependencies:

```ruby
require "sinatra/base"
require "haml"
require "grit"
require "rdiscount"
require "rack-xslview"
require "rexml/document"
require "rack-docunext-content-length"

module GitWiki
  class << self
    attr_accessor :homepage, :extension, :repository
  end

```
