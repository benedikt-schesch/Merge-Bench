Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature for `get_page`. The conflict is about whether `target_url` should be a positional parameter or a keyword argument.

- HEAD side: `def get_page(target_url)` - uses positional parameter
- Other side: `def get_page(target_url: nil)` - uses keyword argument with nil default

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checking or default value handling, and the comment indicates this is an "API-generated URL", it seems the parameter is required. The keyword argument approach with a nil default doesn't align well with this usage pattern.

However, looking at Ruby conventions and modern best practices, keyword arguments are often preferred for clarity. But given that:
1. The parameter appears to be required (used directly without nil checking)
2. The method name and usage pattern suggest this is a simple getter with one required parameter
3. The existing code expects the URL to be provided

I'll keep the positional parameter approach from HEAD as it better represents the required nature of the parameter.

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of ConferenceInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of ConferenceInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return ConferencePage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
