Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - implementing a `get_page` method that retrieves a page of BindingInstance records. The only difference is in the method signature:

- HEAD: `def get_page(target_url)` - uses a positional parameter
- The other branch: `def get_page(target_url: nil)` - uses a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`

Based on Ruby conventions and the fact that the newer branch is using keyword arguments (which is more modern Ruby style and provides better API clarity), I'll resolve this by keeping the keyword argument version:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of BindingInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of BindingInstance
            def get_page(target_url: nil)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return BindingPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
