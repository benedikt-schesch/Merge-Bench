Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- The HEAD version has no blank line between the softmax condition block and the else block
- The branch `08ab5310c30a528313f03790c68868941ad26101` adds a blank line between these blocks

This appears to be a formatting/style conflict rather than a semantic one. The branch is trying to improve code readability by adding visual separation between the two conditional branches.

Since this is purely a stylistic change that improves readability without changing functionality, I'll resolve in favor of the branch that adds the blank line:

```ruby
            end
          end
          if @activation[n] == :softmax
            values = @propagation_functions[n].call(sums)
            values.each_index { |j| @activation_nodes[n + 1][j] = values[j] }

          else
            sums.each_index do |j|
              @activation_nodes[n + 1][j] = @propagation_functions[n].call(sums[j])
            end
          end

```
