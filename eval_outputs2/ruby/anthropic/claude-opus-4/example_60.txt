Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD**: Uses a `url(action)` method call to construct the URL
- **Other branch**: Uses string interpolation with `base_url(action)` and `action` to construct the URL

Both sides appear to be trying to construct the same URL endpoint, just using different approaches. The HEAD version suggests there's a dedicated `url` method that likely encapsulates the URL construction logic, while the other branch constructs it inline using `base_url` and the action.

Since both are semantically trying to achieve the same thing (construct the proper URL for the SSL POST), and the HEAD version uses a more encapsulated approach with the `url` method, I'll preserve the HEAD version as it appears to be a cleaner abstraction:

```ruby
        JSON.parse(body)
      end

      def commit(action, parameters, options)
        begin
          raw_response = ssl_post(url(action), post_data(action, parameters), request_headers(options))
          response = parse(raw_response)
        rescue ResponseError => e
          raw_response = e.response.body
          response = parse(raw_response)
        end

```
