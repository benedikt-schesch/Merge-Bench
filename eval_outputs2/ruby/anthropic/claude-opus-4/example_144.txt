Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define keyboard shortcuts in the `notes_mode_map`. The conflict appears to be about:

1. **HEAD**: Has two lines - one calling `Notes.archieve` (note the typo) and another calling `Agenda.quick_add_line`
2. **Branch 03fb00d8**: Has one line calling `Notes.archive` (correct spelling)

The semantic intent seems to be:
- Both sides want to bind CA (Ctrl-A) to an archive function
- The branch has the correct spelling "archive" vs the typo "archieve" in HEAD
- HEAD also adds an additional keybinding for CC (Ctrl-C) to `Agenda.quick_add_line`

The resolution should:
1. Use the correct spelling "archive" from the branch
2. Keep the additional CC keybinding from HEAD

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby

  def self.keys
    # Get reference to map if already there (don't mess with existing buffers)
    elvar.notes_mode_map = make_sparse_keymap unless boundp :notes_mode_map

    Keys.CA(:notes_mode_map) { Notes.archive }
    Keys.CC(:notes_mode_map) { Agenda.quick_add_line }
    Keys.CO(:notes_mode_map) { Notes.show_text }
    Keys.CM(:notes_mode_map) { Notes.hide_text }
    Keys.CS(:notes_mode_map) { $el.insert Time.now.strftime("- %Y-%m-%d %I:%M%p: ").downcase.sub(' 0', ' ') }

    Keys.CT(:notes_mode_map) { Notes.move_block_to_top }

```
