Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Wants to decode the mailbox name from UTF-7 encoding using `Net::IMAP.decode_utf7(name.to_s)`
- **Incoming change (right side)**: Wants to localize the mailbox name using `labels.localize(name)`

Both changes appear to be transforming the mailbox name, but for different purposes:
- UTF-7 decoding is about character encoding (handling international characters in IMAP)
- Localization is about translating/adapting names for different locales

Without more context about the system's requirements and whether these transformations are mutually exclusive or should be combined, I cannot determine the correct resolution. The intent is ambiguous - should we:
1. Only decode UTF-7?
2. Only localize?
3. Do both (and in what order)?
4. Make it conditional based on some criteria?

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```ruby
      #     mailbox.count(:all)
      #     ...
      #   end
      def mailbox(name, &block)
        @mailbox_mutex.synchronize do
<<<<<<< HEAD
          name = Net::IMAP.decode_utf7(name.to_s)
=======
          name = labels.localize(name)
>>>>>>> 90b1739798b8d0c0d3057011c38315c3543af816
          mailbox = (mailboxes[name] ||= Mailbox.new(self, name))
          switch_to_mailbox(mailbox) if @current_mailbox != mailbox

          if block_given?
            mailbox_stack << @current_mailbox

```
