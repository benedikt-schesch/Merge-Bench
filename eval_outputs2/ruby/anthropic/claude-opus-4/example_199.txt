Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD**: The method signature is `def get_page(target_url)` - using positional parameter
- **Branch d26f64b**: The method signature is `def get_page(target_url: nil)` - using keyword argument with a default value

The branch version is trying to convert the parameter to a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`. This is likely part of a broader refactoring to use keyword arguments for better API clarity and allowing optional parameters.

Since the rest of the method body remains the same and both versions use `target_url` in the same way, the semantic intent is preserved. The keyword argument version with default value provides more flexibility while maintaining backward compatibility if called with a keyword.

Here's the resolved version:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of PublicKeyInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of PublicKeyInstance
            def get_page(target_url: nil)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return PublicKeyPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
