Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides have the same implementation of the `manhattan_distance` method. The only difference is that the HEAD version has no blank line after the method definition, while the other branch (08ab5310c30a528313f03790c68868941ad26101) has added a blank line.

Since both sides have identical logic and the only difference is formatting (presence of a blank line), I'll resolve this by keeping the version with the blank line as it provides better readability by separating the method signature from its implementation.

```ruby
      
      
      # city block, Manhattan distance, or L1 norm.
      # Parameters a and b are vectors with continuous attributes.
      def manhattan_distance(a, b)

        sum = 0.0
        a.each_with_index do |item_a, i|
          item_b = b[i]
          sum += (item_a - item_b).abs
        end

```
