Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same `get_page` method, but with different parameter syntax:

- HEAD version: `def get_page(target_url)` - positional parameter
- Other version: `def get_page(target_url: nil)` - keyword parameter with default nil value

The semantic intent appears to be to make the `target_url` parameter more flexible. The keyword parameter syntax with a default value is generally preferred in modern Ruby as it:
1. Makes the code more explicit at the call site
2. Allows for optional parameters
3. Is more flexible for future additions

However, looking at the method body, `target_url` is used directly in the request, suggesting it's likely a required parameter. The `nil` default might not make semantic sense here.

Since I cannot determine with certainty whether `target_url` should be optional or required (the nil default suggests optional, but the usage suggests required), I'll return the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of DomainInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of DomainInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD
              def get_page(target_url)
=======
              def get_page(target_url: nil)
>>>>>>> d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return DomainPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
