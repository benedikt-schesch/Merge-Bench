Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD wants to include `auth_type` in the list of parameters: `%w[display scope auth_type]`
- The incoming change only has: `%w[display scope]`

Since HEAD is adding `auth_type` as an additional parameter to be processed alongside `display` and `scope`, and the incoming change doesn't explicitly remove it (it just doesn't have it), the semantic intent appears to be that HEAD wants to expand the functionality to also handle the `auth_type` parameter.

The resolution should include all three parameters to preserve the expanded functionality from HEAD:

```ruby
      #
      # /auth/facebook?display=popup
      #
      def authorize_params
        super.tap do |params|
          %w[display scope auth_type].each do |v|
            if request.params[v]
              params[v.to_sym] = request.params[v]
            end
          end
