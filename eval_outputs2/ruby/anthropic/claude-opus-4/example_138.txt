Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to require similar files but with some differences:

- HEAD side: requires "parser", "writer", and "reader"
- Other side: requires "parse", "writer", and "smarter_csv"

The semantic intent appears to be including the necessary components for CSV parsing/reading functionality. The conflict seems to be about:
1. "parser" vs "parse" - likely the same functionality with different file names
2. "reader" vs "smarter_csv" - possibly reorganized code where "reader" functionality moved to "smarter_csv"

Without more context about the codebase structure and which files actually exist, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The safest approach is to return the snippet with the conflict markers intact:

```ruby
require 'smarter_csv/header_transformations'
require 'smarter_csv/header_validations'
require "smarter_csv/headers"
require "smarter_csv/hash_transformations"

<<<<<<< HEAD
require "smarter_csv/parser"
require "smarter_csv/writer"
require "smarter_csv/reader"
=======
require "smarter_csv/parse"
require "smarter_csv/writer"
require "smarter_csv/smarter_csv"
