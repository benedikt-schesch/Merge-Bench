Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature of `get_page`. 

- HEAD version: `def get_page(target_url)`
- Other branch: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

The semantic difference is that the HEAD version uses a positional parameter while the other branch is converting it to a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks or default handling, and the documentation indicates this is an "API-generated URL", it seems this parameter is required. The keyword argument approach with `nil` default would make this parameter optional, which doesn't align with the method's apparent intent.

However, without more context about the broader refactoring effort or architectural decisions, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The change to keyword arguments might be part of a larger API consistency effort.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of CallInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of CallInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD
            def get_page(target_url)
=======
            def get_page(target_url: nil)
>>>>>>> d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return CallPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
