Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - defining a `get_page` method that takes a `target_url` parameter. The only difference is:

- HEAD version: uses positional parameter syntax `def get_page(target_url)`
- Other branch: uses keyword argument syntax `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

Given that this is a Ruby method that retrieves a page from an API using a target URL, and the URL is clearly required for the method to function (it's passed directly to the request), the positional parameter syntax from HEAD is more appropriate. A required parameter shouldn't have a default value of `nil`.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of IpAccessControlListMappingInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of IpAccessControlListMappingInstance
                def get_page(target_url)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return IpAccessControlListMappingPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
