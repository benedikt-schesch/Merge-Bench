Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature for `get_page`. The conflict is about whether `target_url` should be a positional parameter or a keyword argument.

- HEAD version: `def get_page(target_url)` - positional parameter
- Other branch: `def get_page(target_url: nil)` - keyword argument with nil default

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly in the request call without any nil checking or default value handling, and given that the documentation indicates this is an "API-generated URL", it seems this parameter is required and should always be provided.

The keyword argument approach with `nil` default doesn't align well with the intent - if `target_url` is nil, the request would likely fail. The positional parameter approach better conveys that this is a required parameter.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of LastMonthInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of LastMonthInstance
                def get_page(target_url)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return LastMonthPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
