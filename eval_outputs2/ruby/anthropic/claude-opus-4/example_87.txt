Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has nothing after the `end` statement and the closing of what appears to be a method or block, while the other side is adding RSpec configuration to disable paging in Commander::UI before each test.

The intent seems clear - the incoming change wants to add test configuration to prevent paging during tests, which is a common and sensible practice. This doesn't conflict with any intent from the HEAD side, which simply has the end of the previous code block.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```ruby
  new_command_runner(*args) do
    program :help_formatter, Commander::HelpFormatter::Base
  end.run!    
  @output.string
end

RSpec.configure do |c|
  c.before(:each) do
    allow(Commander::UI).to receive(:enable_paging)
  end
end

```
