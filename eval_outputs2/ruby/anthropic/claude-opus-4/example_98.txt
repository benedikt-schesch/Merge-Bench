Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - checking if the Rails version is less than 4. The only difference is the style of quotes used:

- HEAD uses double quotes: `"4"`
- The incoming change uses single quotes: `'4'`

Since both accomplish the same intent and the conflict is purely stylistic, I'll resolve this by choosing the single quotes version, which is generally preferred in Ruby style guides for strings that don't require interpolation.

```ruby
end

class TestModelSecurityModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  using_access_control

  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :attr, :attr_2, :test_attrs
  end
end
class TestModelSecurityModelWithFind < ActiveRecord::Base
  if Rails.version < "3.2"

```
