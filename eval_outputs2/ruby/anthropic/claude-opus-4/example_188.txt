Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same method `get_page`, but with different parameter syntax:

- HEAD version: Uses positional parameter `target_url`
- Other version: Uses keyword parameter `target_url: nil` with a default value

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both versions want to accept a `target_url` parameter and use it to make a GET request. The difference is in the Ruby parameter style.

Given that:
1. The method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks
2. The comment indicates this is for "API-generated URL for the requested results page" (suggesting it's a required parameter)
3. The keyword argument style with `nil` default seems inconsistent with requiring a URL

The HEAD version with the positional parameter appears more semantically correct for this use case. A required URL parameter shouldn't have a nil default.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of MessageInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of MessageInstance
              def get_page(target_url)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return MessagePage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
