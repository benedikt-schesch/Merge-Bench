Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD**: Uses positional parameter `target_url`
- **Incoming change**: Uses keyword argument `target_url: nil`

The conflict is about changing from a positional parameter to a keyword argument. This is a common Ruby refactoring pattern to make method calls more explicit and allow for optional parameters.

Since the incoming change adds a default value of `nil` and converts to a keyword argument, this appears to be an intentional API improvement. The method body uses `target_url` without any nil checks, suggesting it expects a value to be provided, but having a keyword argument with a default makes the API more flexible and explicit.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of MessageInteractionInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of MessageInteractionInstance
                def get_page(target_url: nil)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return MessageInteractionPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
