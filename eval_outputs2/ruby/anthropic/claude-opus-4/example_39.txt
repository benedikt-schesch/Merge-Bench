Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same `sup_distance` method, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Defines it as an instance method
- **Branch 753f2ec**: Defines it as a class method (with `self.`) and adds documentation comments

The semantic intent appears to be the same - implementing the sup distance (L-infinity norm) calculation. The key difference is whether this should be a class method or instance method. Given that this is a distance calculation that takes two parameters and doesn't seem to rely on instance state, the class method approach makes more sense and is more flexible.

Additionally, the branch adds helpful documentation which improves code clarity.

Here's the resolved version:

```ruby
        return sum
      end
      
      # Sup distance, or L-intinity norm
      # Parameters a and b are vectors with continuous attributes.      
      # @param a [Object]
      # @param b [Object]
      # @return [Object]
      def self.sup_distance(a, b)
        distance = 0.0
        a.each_with_index do |item_a, i|
          item_b = b[i]
          diff = (item_a - item_b).abs
          distance = diff if diff > distance

```
