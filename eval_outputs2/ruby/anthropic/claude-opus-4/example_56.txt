Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they both want to define the `sup_distance` method. The only difference is that the branch `08ab5310c30a528313f03790c68868941ad26101` has added extra blank lines before and after the method definition.

Since both sides have the same method signature and the intent is identical (to define the sup_distance method), I'll resolve this by keeping the version without the extra blank lines for consistency with the surrounding code style.

```ruby
        return sum
      end
      
      # Sup distance, or L-intinity norm
      # Parameters a and b are vectors with continuous attributes.      
      def sup_distance(a, b)
        distance = 0.0
        a.each_with_index do |item_a, i|
          item_b = b[i]
          diff = (item_a - item_b).abs
          distance = diff if diff > distance

```
