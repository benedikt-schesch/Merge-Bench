Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - adding a Rails version check to conditionally use `attr_accessible` for Rails versions before 4.0.

The only differences are:
- HEAD uses double quotes: `"4"`
- The other branch uses single quotes: `'4'` and has an extra blank line before the conditional

Since both sides have the same intent and the difference is merely stylistic (quotes and whitespace), I'll resolve this by choosing the cleaner version without the extra blank line and using single quotes (which is more common in Ruby for simple strings):

```ruby
end

class Branch < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  belongs_to :company
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :name, :company
  end
end
class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs

```
