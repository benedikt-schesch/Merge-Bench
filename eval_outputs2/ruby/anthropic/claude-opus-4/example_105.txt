Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different belongs_to associations and update the attr_accessible list accordingly:

- HEAD adds just the basic `belongs_to :company` association
- The incoming change adds both `belongs_to :company` AND `belongs_to :test_model`, and includes `:test_model` in the attr_accessible list

The semantic intent appears to be that the Branch model should have both associations. The conflict arose because both sides added the `belongs_to :company` line, but the incoming change also added the additional `test_model` association.

Here's the resolved version that preserves both associations:

```ruby
end

class Branch < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  belongs_to :company
  belongs_to :test_model
  
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :name, :company, :test_model
  end
end
class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  has_many :branches

```
