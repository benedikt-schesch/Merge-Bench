Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature for `get_page`. The conflict is between:

- HEAD: `def get_page(target_url)`
- Other branch: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

The semantic difference is that HEAD expects a positional argument while the other branch is converting it to a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks or default handling, and based on the comment indicating this is for retrieving a page from an "API-generated URL", it seems the intent is that `target_url` should be a required parameter. The keyword argument approach with `nil` default doesn't make semantic sense here as you wouldn't want to make a request with a nil URL.

However, the other branch might be part of a broader refactoring to use keyword arguments consistently across the codebase. In that case, the better resolution would be to use a keyword argument but make it required:

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of AllTimeInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of AllTimeInstance
                def get_page(target_url:)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return AllTimePage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```

This resolution maintains the requirement that `target_url` must be provided while adopting the keyword argument syntax pattern.
