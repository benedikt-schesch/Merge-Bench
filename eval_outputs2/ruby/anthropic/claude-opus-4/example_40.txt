Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to implement the same `hamming_distance` method, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Defines it as an instance method
- **Other branch (753f2ec)**: Defines it as a class method (with `self.`) and adds documentation comments

Based on the semantic intent, the other branch appears to be making improvements by:
1. Converting it to a class method (which makes sense for a utility function like Hamming distance)
2. Adding proper documentation with parameter and return type annotations

The resolution should accept the improvements from the other branch:

```ruby
      # The Hamming distance between two attributes vectors of equal 
      # length is the number of attributes for which the corresponding 
      # vectors are different
      # This distance function is frequently used with binary attributes,
      # though it can be used with other discrete attributes.
      # @param a [Object]
      # @param b [Object]
      # @return [Object]
      def self.hamming_distance(a,b)
        count = 0
        a.each_index do |i|
          count += 1 if a[i] != b[i]
        end
        return count

```
