Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same `get_page` method, but with different parameter signatures:

- HEAD version: `def get_page(target_url)`
- Incoming version: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

The incoming change is converting the positional parameter to a keyword parameter with a default value of `nil`. This is a common Ruby pattern that makes the API more flexible and explicit.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks or default handling, and considering modern Ruby best practices favor keyword arguments for clarity, the semantic intent appears to be making the parameter more explicit while maintaining the same functionality.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of ActivityInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of ActivityInstance
            def get_page(target_url: nil)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return ActivityPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
