Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the same test method, but with different names and approaches:

- HEAD side: Names the test `test_worker_uses_one_conn` and includes a `skip` statement indicating the test is broken
- Other side: Names the test `test_worker_reuses_conn` (similar intent, slightly different wording)

Both sides appear to be testing the same concept - that workers efficiently use/reuse database connections. The HEAD side acknowledges the test is broken with a skip statement, while the other side doesn't have this skip statement.

Given that the HEAD side explicitly marks this test as broken and needing fixes, the safer semantic resolution is to keep the skip statement while using the more descriptive method name from the other side. This preserves the warning about the test's broken state while adopting the clearer method name.

```ruby
    p_queue.enqueue("TestObject.two_args", "1", 2)
    p_queue.conn_adapter.disconnect
    t.join
  end

  def test_worker_reuses_conn
    skip "This test is broken and needs to be fixed."

    QC.enqueue("TestObject.no_args")
    count = QC.default_conn_adapter.execute("SELECT count(*) from pg_stat_activity where datname = current_database()")["count"].to_i;
    worker = TestWorker.new
    worker.work

```
