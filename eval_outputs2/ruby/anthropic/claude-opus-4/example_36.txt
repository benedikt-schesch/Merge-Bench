Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to improve the same method, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Changes the method from a module method to an instance method (removes `self.`)
- **Other branch (753f2ec)**: Adds documentation comments (@param and @return) while keeping it as a module method

Since this is a module called `Proximity` that provides distance functions, and the method is described as a "computational replacement for euclidean distance", it makes semantic sense for this to be a module method (accessible via `Proximity.squared_euclidean_distance`) rather than an instance method.

The documentation additions are also valuable for clarity. Therefore, I'll keep the `self.` prefix and include the documentation:

```ruby
    # This module provides classical distance functions
    module Proximity
      
      # This is a faster computational replacement for eclidean distance.
      # Parameters a and b are vectors with continuous attributes.
      # @param a [Object]
      # @param b [Object]
      # @return [Object]
      def self.squared_euclidean_distance(a, b)
        sum = 0.0
        a.each_with_index do |item_a, i|
          item_b = b[i]
          sum += (item_a - item_b)**2
        end

```
