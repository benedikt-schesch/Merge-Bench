Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call `Sidekiq::CurrentAttributes.persist` but with different arguments:

- HEAD version: `Sidekiq::CurrentAttributes.persist("Myapp::Current", @config)`
- Other version: `Sidekiq::CurrentAttributes.persist("Myapp::Current")`

The key difference is that HEAD includes `@config` as a second parameter while the other version doesn't.

Looking at the context below the conflict, I can see that `@config` is being used immediately after in `@config.client_middleware.invoke`, which suggests that `@config` is an important part of the test setup and is needed for the test to work properly.

The HEAD version appears to be the correct resolution since it includes the necessary `@config` parameter that's required for the subsequent test operations.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
    end
    # the Rails reloader is responsible for reseting Current after every unit of work
  end

  it "persists" do
    Sidekiq::CurrentAttributes.persist("Myapp::Current", @config)
    job_hash = {}
    with_context(:user_id, 16) do
      @config.client_middleware.invoke(nil, job_hash, nil, nil) do
        assert_equal 16, job_hash["cattr"][:user_id]
      end

```
