Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- The HEAD branch is trying to add an index on the "stages" table
- The other branch (ae6cc159...) is trying to create a new table called "user_project_links"

These are two completely different operations that don't conflict semantically - one is adding an index to an existing table, and the other is creating a new table. Both changes should be included in the final result.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
    t.text     "alert_emails"
    t.integer  "locked_by_deployment_id"
    t.integer  "locked",                  :default => 0
  end

  add_index "stages", ["project_id"], :name => "index_stages_on_project_id"

  create_table "user_project_links", :force => true do |t|
    t.integer  "user_id"
    t.integer  "project_id"
    t.datetime "created_at"
    t.datetime "updated_at"
  end

  create_table "users", :force => true do |t|
    t.string   "login"
    t.string   "email"
    t.string   "crypted_password",          :limit => 40
```
