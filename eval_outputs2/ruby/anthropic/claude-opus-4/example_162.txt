Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same method `get_page`, but with different parameter styles:

- The HEAD version uses a positional parameter: `def get_page(target_url)`
- The incoming change uses a keyword argument with a default value: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both versions want to accept a `target_url` parameter. The difference is in the calling convention. The keyword argument approach in the incoming change is more explicit and provides a default value of `nil`.

Looking at the method body, `target_url` is passed directly to `@version.domain.request`, so it seems the parameter is required for the method to function properly. Having a default of `nil` might not be semantically correct if the method expects a valid URL.

Given that the rest of the code remains the same and both sides want the same functionality, I'll preserve the HEAD version with the positional parameter, as it better reflects that `target_url` is a required parameter:

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of CredentialListMappingInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of CredentialListMappingInstance
                def get_page(target_url)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return CredentialListMappingPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
