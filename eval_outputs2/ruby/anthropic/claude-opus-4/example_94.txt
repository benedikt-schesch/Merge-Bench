Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to include the same module (`ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper`), but HEAD has additional comments explaining why the include is necessary.

The semantic intent is clear:
- Both sides want to include `ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper`
- HEAD provides helpful documentation about why this include is needed (Rails includes it automatically but too late for an `alias_method_chain` call)
- The actual functionality is identical

Since the comments provide valuable context about why this include is necessary, I'll keep them in the resolved version:

```ruby
module PhotosHelper
  
  # Rails automatically includes this, but not until after this file,
  # so the :image_path won't exist for the alias_method_chain call, below.
  # Thus, we include it now:
  include ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper
  
  def image photo, size = :square, img_opts = {}
    return image_tag(image_path( photo, size), :class => size) if photo.image.blank?
    img_tag = image_tag(image_path( photo, size), {:title=>photo.caption, :alt=>photo.caption, :class=>size}.merge(img_opts))
    img_tag

```
