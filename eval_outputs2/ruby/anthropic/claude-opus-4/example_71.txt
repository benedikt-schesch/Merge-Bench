Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - adding timing/logging functionality to track when the render process starts. The semantic intent is identical, but the implementation differs slightly:

- HEAD version uses `puts` with a formatted string that includes "Starting Render:"
- The other branch uses `printf` with a format specifier `%g` and ends with a period

The HEAD version appears more consistent with the Ruby style and the existing logging pattern (note the similar `puts` statement a few lines below). Here's the resolved version:

```ruby
    @document.render(:html, :template => "public/noc_html/views", :output => "public/noc_html/index.html")
    redirect "noc_html/index.html"
  end
  
  get '/create_pdf/:filename' do
    
    startTime = Time.now
    puts "///////// Starting Render: #{startTime}"
        
    # first render html
    @document = AsciiDoc::AsciiDocument.new("public/#{params[:filename]}", { :debug_xml_to_file => "public/#{params[:filename]}.xml" })
    puts "Parsed Asciidoc after: #{Time.now-startTime} seconds"
    
    @document.render(:html, :template => "public/noc_pdf/views", :output => "public/noc_pdf/index.html")

```
