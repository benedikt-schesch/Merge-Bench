Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - checking if Rails version is less than 4. The only differences are:

1. HEAD uses double quotes: `"4"`
2. The incoming change uses single quotes: `'4'` and adds an extra blank line before the if statement

Since both accomplish the same semantic goal and the difference is purely stylistic, I'll choose the incoming change as it includes the extra spacing which might be intentional for readability.

```ruby
  end
  has_many :test_attrs
  belongs_to :test_attr
  using_access_control :include_read => true, 
    :context => :test_model_security_models
  
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :test_attr, :attr
  end
end

class Branch < ActiveRecord::Base
