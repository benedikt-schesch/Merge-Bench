Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they both want to return `true` when an `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` exception is caught. The only difference is formatting/whitespace.

The HEAD version has cleaner formatting without extra spaces, while the other branch has trailing spaces and extra blank lines. Since the semantic intent is identical, I'll resolve this by taking the cleaner HEAD version:

```ruby

    def perform
      load(object).send(method, *args.map{|a| load(a)})
    rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
      # We cannot do anything about objects which were deleted in the meantime
      true
    end

    private

    def load(arg)
      case arg
      when AR_STRING_FORMAT then $1.constantize.find($2)

```
