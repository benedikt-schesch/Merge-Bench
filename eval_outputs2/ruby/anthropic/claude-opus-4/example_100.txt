Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar functionality with some differences:

1. Both sides want to define `attr_accessible` for Rails versions before 4
2. HEAD has: `belongs_to :company` and `attr_accessible :name, :company`
3. The incoming change adds: `belongs_to :test_model` and includes `:test_model` in `attr_accessible`
4. The incoming change also uses single quotes for the version string instead of double quotes

The semantic intent appears to be merging both associations and their corresponding accessible attributes. Here's the resolved conflict:

```ruby
end

class Branch < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  belongs_to :company
  belongs_to :test_model
  
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :name, :company, :test_model
  end
end
class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  has_many :branches

```
