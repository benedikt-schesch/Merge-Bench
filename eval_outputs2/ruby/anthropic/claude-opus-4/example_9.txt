Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - adding two process IDs to a Redis set. The semantic differences are:

1. **Redis connection method**: HEAD uses `@cfg.redis` while the other branch uses `Sidekiq.redis`
2. **Method of adding to set**: HEAD uses two separate `sadd` calls, while the other branch uses a single `sadd` with an array

Based on the context and the fact that the other branch appears to be more recent (given the file rename from `test/api.rb` to `test/test_api.rb`), I'll resolve this by using the `Sidekiq.redis` connection method with the array syntax for `sadd`:

```ruby
      end
    end

    describe "workers_size" do
      it "retrieves the number of busy workers" do
        Sidekiq.redis do |c|
          c.sadd("processes", ["process_1", "process_2"])
          c.hset("process_1", "busy", 1)
          c.hset("process_2", "busy", 2)
        end
        s = Sidekiq::Stats.new
        assert_equal 3, s.workers_size

```
