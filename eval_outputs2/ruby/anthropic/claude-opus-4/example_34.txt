Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has nothing additional after the `docroot` line, while the other side adds a `notifies` directive to restart the apache2 service.

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD: Keep the web app configuration simple without notifications
- Other branch: Add a notification to restart apache2 when this web app configuration changes

This is a common pattern in Chef recipes where you want services to be restarted when their configuration files change. The `notifies :restart` with `:delayed` means the apache2 service will be restarted at the end of the Chef run if this resource changes.

Since this notification is generally a good practice (ensuring apache2 picks up configuration changes), and it doesn't conflict with any functionality on the HEAD side, the appropriate resolution is to include the notification.

```ruby
    template "web_app.conf.erb"
    server_name site["host"]
    server_aliases site["aliases"]
    server_include site["include"]
    docroot site["docroot"]?site["docroot"]:"/vagrant/public/#{site["host"]}"
    notifies :restart, resources("service[apache2]"), :delayed
  end

   # Add site info in /etc/hosts
   bash "hosts" do
     code "echo 127.0.0.1 #{site["host"]} #{site["aliases"].join(' ')} >> /etc/hosts"

```
