Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Has a method signature `def get_page(target_url)` that takes `target_url` as a positional parameter
- **Incoming changes (right side)**: Has a method signature `def get_page(target_url: nil)` that takes `target_url` as a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`

The key semantic difference is:
- The HEAD version requires `target_url` to be provided as a positional argument
- The incoming version makes `target_url` an optional keyword argument with a default of `nil`

Looking at the method body, `target_url` is used directly in the `@version.domain.request` call. If `target_url` were `nil`, this would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior since we're making an HTTP GET request to that URL.

Given that the method's purpose is to "Retrieve a single page of DailyInstance records from the API" using an "API-generated URL", it seems semantically incorrect to allow `target_url` to be `nil`. The method appears to require a valid URL to function properly.

Therefore, the HEAD version (positional required parameter) appears to be the semantically correct choice, as it ensures `target_url` is always provided.

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of DailyInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of DailyInstance
                def get_page(target_url)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return DailyPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
