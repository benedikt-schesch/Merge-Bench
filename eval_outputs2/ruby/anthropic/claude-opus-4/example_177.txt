Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature for `get_page`. 

The HEAD version has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url)
```

The incoming change (d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0) has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url: nil)
```

The semantic intent here is clear: the incoming change is converting the positional parameter `target_url` to a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`. This is a common Ruby refactoring pattern that makes the API more explicit and allows for optional parameters.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any modification, and keyword arguments are generally preferred in modern Ruby for clarity, the resolution should accept the incoming change.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of InteractionInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of InteractionInstance
              def get_page(target_url: nil)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return InteractionPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
