Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch) is adding three new attribute accessors: `timer`, `control_uri`, and `control`
- The incoming branch (7ba5425c6c4369c537c25fce6dd5f1aaf6e5b6c4) appears to have removed these attributes or never had them

Given that this is a semantic merge conflict resolution, I should consider the intent:
- The HEAD branch seems to be adding functionality related to control and timing
- The incoming branch doesn't have these attributes

Since the HEAD branch is actively adding these attributes (rather than the incoming branch removing them), and these appear to be new features, the semantic intent seems to be to keep these additions.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
  # view the TweetStream::Daemon class.
  class Client

    # @private
    attr_accessor *Configuration::VALID_OPTIONS_KEYS
    attr_accessor :timer
    attr_reader :control_uri
    attr_reader :control

    # Creates a new API
    def initialize(options={})
      options = TweetStream.options.merge(options)
      Configuration::VALID_OPTIONS_KEYS.each do |key|

```
