Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

**HEAD (left side)**: Adds an `installers` method that returns the last element of `@install_queues`

**Other branch (right side)**: Removes/doesn't have the `installers` method

Looking at the context, particularly the `install` method below that calls `installers << i`, it's clear that the `installers` method is needed for the code to function properly. The `install` method depends on having access to an `installers` collection to append installers to it.

The semantic intent appears to be that the HEAD side is providing the necessary `installers` method that the `install` method requires, while the other branch may have inadvertently removed it or never had it.

Resolution: Keep the `installers` method from HEAD since it's required by the `install` method.

```ruby
        @install_queues.push []
        yield
        @install_queues.pop
      end

      def installers
        @install_queues.last
      end

    protected

      def install(i)
        installers << i
        i

```
