Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch adds a call to `GmailImapExtensions.patch_net_imap_response_parser` and explicitly returns `@imap`, while the other branch simply removes those lines.

The intent appears to be:
- HEAD: After creating the IMAP connection, patch the Net::IMAP response parser (likely to handle Gmail-specific responses) and explicitly return the imap object
- Other branch: Just create the connection without any additional setup

Since the HEAD branch is adding functionality (patching the parser) that seems important for Gmail-specific handling, and the explicit return doesn't hurt, I'll resolve in favor of HEAD to preserve this functionality:

```ruby
      end
      
      # Connect to gmail service. 
      def connect(raise_errors=false)
        @imap = Net::IMAP.new(GMAIL_IMAP_HOST, GMAIL_IMAP_PORT, true, nil, false)
        GmailImapExtensions.patch_net_imap_response_parser
        @imap
      rescue SocketError
        raise_errors and raise ConnectionError, "Couldn't establish connection with GMail IMAP service"
      end
      
      # This version of connect will raise error on failure...
```
