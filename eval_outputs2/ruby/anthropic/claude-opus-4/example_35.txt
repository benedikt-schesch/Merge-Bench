Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - implementing the `sup_distance` method. The only difference is that the HEAD version has no blank line after the method definition, while the other branch has added a blank line.

Since this is purely a formatting difference and both sides have the same semantic intent (implementing the sup distance/L-infinity norm calculation), I'll resolve this by keeping the version with the blank line, as it provides better readability by separating the method signature from its implementation.

```ruby
      end
      
      # Sup distance, or L-intinity norm
      # Parameters a and b are vectors with continuous attributes.      
      def sup_distance(a, b)

        distance = 0.0
        a.each_with_index do |item_a, i|
          item_b = b[i]
          diff = (item_a - item_b).abs
          distance = diff if diff > distance

```
