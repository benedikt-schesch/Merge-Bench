Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to fix the same issue but with slightly different approaches:

- HEAD version: Uses `controller.is_a?` and has parameter `klass`
- Other version: Uses `@controller.is_a?` and has parameter `objects`

The key difference is:
1. How to reference the controller (`controller` vs `@controller`)
2. The parameter name (`klass` vs `objects`)

Based on the context, it appears the second branch is actually using the `objects` parameter in the logic below (`objects.length <= 3`), while the first branch has `klass` which isn't used. The `@controller` notation is more explicit about using an instance variable.

Here's the resolved version:

```ruby
    "stage: #{link_to current_stage.name, project_stage_path(current_project, current_stage)} (of project #{link_to current_project.name, project_path(current_project)})"
  end

  # returns the open/closed status of a menu
  # either the active controller is used or the given status is returned
  def controller_in_use_or(contr_name, status, objects)
    if @controller.is_a? contr_name
      :open
    else
      if status == :closed && (objects.length <= 3 )
        # the box should be closed
        # open it anyway if we have less than three
```
