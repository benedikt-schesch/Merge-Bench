Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - creating a new `Ai4r::Data::DataSet` object with the same parameters. The only difference is the syntax used:

- HEAD uses the newer Ruby hash syntax with colons after the keys (introduced in Ruby 1.9)
- The other branch uses the older hash rocket syntax (=>)

Since both achieve the exact same result, I'll preserve the newer, more modern syntax from HEAD as it's the preferred style in modern Ruby:

```ruby
      def test(data_set)
        result_data_items = []
        @classifiers.each do |classifier|
          result_data_items << test_classifier(classifier, data_set)
        end
        return Ai4r::Data::DataSet.new(data_items: result_data_items,
          data_labels: ["Classifier","Testing Time","Errors","Success rate"])
      end

      # Perform k-fold cross validation on all classifiers.
      # The dataset is split into +k+ folds using the Split utility. For each
      # fold, classifiers are trained on the remaining folds and then tested on

```
