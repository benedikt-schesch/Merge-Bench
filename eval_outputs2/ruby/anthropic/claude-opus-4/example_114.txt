Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the RSpec syntax from an older style to a newer one. The conflict is about how to express that something should be false:

- HEAD uses: `should be false`
- The incoming change uses: `should be_falsey`

Looking at the context and the second test case below, which appears to be incomplete in the provided snippet, the pattern suggests we should use the newer RSpec syntax consistently.

The `be_falsey` matcher is the more modern RSpec syntax (RSpec 3+), while `be false` is older. Since the incoming change is updating to the newer syntax, that's likely the intent we should preserve.

```ruby

module XCPretty
  describe Term do
    it "marks unicode as unavailable" do
      Encoding.stub(:default_external).and_return(Encoding::ASCII)
      Term.unicode?.should be_falsey
    end

    it "marks unicode as available" do
      Encoding.stub(:default_external).and_return(Encoding::UTF_8)

```
