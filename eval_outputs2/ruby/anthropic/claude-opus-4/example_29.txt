Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to add the same comment explaining what the following code does (converting Unicode "smart" quotes to regular quotes). The only difference is that one side includes profanity ("bullshit") while the other uses a more professional tone.

Since both sides have the same intent - to document the Unicode conversion code - I'll resolve this by choosing the more professional version without the profanity, as this is generally preferred in code comments.

```ruby
        @raw_content.gsub!(/\n{3,}/, "\n\n")
        @raw_content.gsub!(/(\<br(\s\/)?\>){2,}/, "</p><p>")

        # Remove scripts manually, Sanitize and/or Nokogiri seem to go a bit funny with them
        @raw_content.gsub!(/\<script .*?\<\/script\>/im, '')
        
        # Get rid of "smart" quotes and other Unicode nonsense
        @raw_content.force_encoding("ASCII-8BIT") if RUBY_VERSION > "1.9"
        @raw_content.gsub!("\xe2\x80\x89", " ")
        @raw_content.gsub!("\xe2\x80\x99", "'")
        @raw_content.gsub!("\xe2\x80\x98", "'")
        @raw_content.gsub!("\xe2\x80\x9c", '"')

```
