Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature of `get_page`. 

The HEAD version has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url)
```

The incoming change has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url: nil)
```

The semantic intent here is clear - the incoming change is converting the positional parameter `target_url` to a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`. This is a common Ruby refactoring pattern that makes the API more explicit and allows for optional parameters.

Since the rest of the method body remains the same and uses `target_url` in the same way, the conflict resolution should accept the incoming change with the keyword argument syntax.

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of FaxInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of FaxInstance
          def get_page(target_url: nil)
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return FaxPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
