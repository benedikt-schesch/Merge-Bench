Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the `get_page` method signature, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Uses positional parameter `target_url`
- **Branch d26f64b7**: Uses keyword argument `target_url: nil`

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both want a method that accepts a `target_url` parameter. The difference is in the Ruby calling convention. The keyword argument approach (from the branch) is more modern Ruby style and provides better clarity at the call site, plus it has a default value of `nil`.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks, and the documentation indicates this is an "API-generated URL", it seems this parameter is required. However, the keyword argument with default `nil` might be intentional for backwards compatibility or optional usage.

Given that keyword arguments are generally preferred in modern Ruby for their clarity and the branch explicitly added this style, I'll resolve in favor of the keyword argument approach:

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of AccountInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of AccountInstance
          def get_page(target_url: nil)
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return AccountPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
