Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they're both checking if the Rails version is less than 4 to conditionally apply `attr_accessible`. The only difference is:

- HEAD uses double quotes: `"4"`
- The incoming change uses single quotes: `'4'` and has an extra blank line before the if statement

Since both versions are functionally identical (in Ruby, single and double quotes are interchangeable for simple strings like this), I'll resolve this by choosing the version with single quotes as it's generally preferred in Ruby style guides for simple strings. I'll also keep the blank line for better readability.

```ruby
  end
end
class Country < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_models
  has_many :companies
  
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :name
  end
end

class NamedScopeModelTest < Test::Unit::TestCase

```
