Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature for `get_page`. 

The HEAD version has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url)
```

The incoming change has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url: nil)
```

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD keeps the positional parameter
- The incoming change converts it to a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly in the request, and this appears to be an API-generated URL that should be required (based on the documentation comment), the positional parameter approach from HEAD seems more appropriate. Making it an optional keyword argument with `nil` default doesn't align with the documented behavior that requires an "API-generated URL".

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of AlertInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of AlertInstance
          def get_page(target_url)
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return AlertPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
