Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD uses `m.route_resource` (singular)
- The incoming change uses `m.route_resources` (plural)

Given the context:
1. The variable is named `controller_plural_name` (plural)
2. The next line uses `m.route_resources` (plural) with `model_controller_plural_name`
3. This appears to be generating routes for authentication-related controllers

The semantic intent seems to be that the incoming change is correcting the method call to use the plural form `route_resources`, which is consistent with routing multiple resources and matches the plural nature of the controller name variable.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
        m.migration_template 'migration.rb', 'db/migrate', :assigns => {
          :migration_name => "Create#{class_name.pluralize.gsub(/::/, '')}"
        }, :migration_file_name => "create_#{file_path.gsub(/\//, '_').pluralize}"
      end
      unless options[:skip_routes]
        m.route_resources  controller_plural_name
        m.route_resources model_controller_plural_name
        m.route_name('signup', '/signup', {:controller => model_controller_plural_name, :action => 'new'})
        m.route_name('register', '/register', {:controller => model_controller_plural_name, :action => 'create'})
        m.route_name('login', '/login', {:controller => controller_plural_name, :action => 'new'})
        m.route_name('logout', '/logout', {:controller => controller_plural_name, :action => 'destroy'})
