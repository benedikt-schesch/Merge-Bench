Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve with the `photo_path` method signature.

- **HEAD** (current branch): `def photo_path photo = nil, size = nil`
  - Sets both `photo` and `size` parameters to `nil` as defaults
  
- **Incoming change**: `def photo_path photo = nil, size = :square`
  - Sets `photo` to `nil` but `size` to `:square` as defaults

The semantic intent appears to be about what the default value for the `size` parameter should be. Looking at the context:

1. The `image` method above calls `photo_path` with a size parameter that defaults to `:square`
2. Inside `photo_path`, the code handles both `nil` and valid size values
3. When `path` is nil, it calls `missing_photo_path(size)`, which suggests `size` should have a meaningful value

The incoming change (setting default to `:square`) appears more semantically correct because:
- It's consistent with the `image` method's default
- It provides a sensible default for `missing_photo_path`
- The method still handles nil checks for the photo parameter

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
  def image photo, size = :square, img_opts = {}
    return image_tag(image_path( photo, size), :class => size) if photo.image.blank?
    img_tag = image_tag(photo_path( photo, size), {:title=>photo.caption, :alt=>photo.caption, :class=>size}.merge(img_opts))
    img_tag
  end

  def photo_path photo = nil, size = :square
    path = nil
    unless photo.nil? || photo.image.blank?
      path = url_for_file_column(photo, :image, size.to_s) rescue nil
    end
    path = missing_photo_path(size) if path.nil?

```
