Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to require TinyMCE-related files, but with different approaches:

- HEAD (current branch): Requires a single file `"tinymce/rails"`
- Incoming branch: Requires multiple specific files including version, railtie, configuration, and helper

Since the incoming branch has more specific and granular requires, it likely represents a refactoring or reorganization of the code structure. The single require in HEAD might be loading all these components through a single entry point, while the incoming changes explicitly require each component.

Without more context about the project structure and whether `"tinymce/rails"` is still a valid entry point that loads all the necessary components, I cannot determine which approach is correct or if both sets of requires are needed.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```ruby
<<<<<<< HEAD
require "tinymce/rails"
=======
require "tinymce/version"
require "tinymce/railtie"
require "tinymce/configuration"
require "tinymce/tinymce_helper"
>>>>>>> 73335b54fae6c17953039b0961b4f1eb1151ad64

```
