Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - checking if the Rails version is less than 4. The only difference is:

- HEAD uses double quotes: `"4"`
- The incoming change uses single quotes: `'4'` and adds a blank line before the if statement

Since both achieve the same functionality and the blank line provides better readability by separating the associations from the conditional logic, I'll resolve by accepting the incoming change:

```ruby
end
class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  has_many :branches
  belongs_to :country
  
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :name, :country, :country_id
  end
end
class SmallCompany < Company
  def self.decl_auth_context

```
