Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD**: Uses positional parameter `target_url`
- **Other branch**: Uses keyword argument `target_url: nil`

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both versions want to accept a `target_url` parameter for the `get_page` method. The difference is in the Ruby calling convention:
- Positional parameters require the argument to be passed in order
- Keyword arguments are more explicit and self-documenting

Given modern Ruby best practices favor keyword arguments for clarity and the fact that the other branch explicitly made this change (likely as part of a refactoring effort), the resolution should use the keyword argument version.

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of MemberInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of MemberInstance
              def get_page(target_url: nil)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return MemberPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
