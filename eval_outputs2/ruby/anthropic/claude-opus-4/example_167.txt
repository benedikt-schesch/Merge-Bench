Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Defines `get_page` with `target_url` as a positional parameter
- **Incoming branch**: Defines `get_page` with `target_url` as a keyword parameter with a default value of `nil`

The semantic intent appears to be about how the `target_url` parameter should be passed to the method. The incoming change is moving from positional to keyword arguments, which is a common Ruby pattern for improving API clarity and flexibility.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks or conditional logic, and given that this appears to be retrieving a page from a specific URL, having `target_url` as a required parameter makes more sense semantically. However, the keyword argument style is generally preferred in modern Ruby for its clarity.

The best resolution would be to use keyword arguments but make it required:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of DocumentPermissionInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of DocumentPermissionInstance
              def get_page(target_url:)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return DocumentPermissionPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
