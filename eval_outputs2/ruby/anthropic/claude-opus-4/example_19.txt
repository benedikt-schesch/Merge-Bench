Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has no setup method, while the other side wants to add a setup method that initializes a `@tracer` instance variable.

Since the conflict is between having nothing versus adding a setup method, and there's already a `teardown` method present (which suggests this test class follows a setup/teardown pattern), the intent appears to be to add the setup method to initialize the tracer for the tests.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
      module Trace
        class SpanTest < Minitest::Test
          Segment = Struct.new(:guid, :transaction)
          Transaction = Struct.new(:trace_id)

          def setup
            @tracer = NewRelic::Agent::OpenTelemetry::Trace::Tracer.new
          end

          def teardown
            NewRelic::Agent.instance.transaction_event_aggregator.reset!
            NewRelic::Agent.instance.span_event_aggregator.reset!
          end


```
