Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - checking if the Rails version is less than 4. The only difference is:

- HEAD uses double quotes: `"4"`
- The incoming change uses single quotes: `'4'` and adds a blank line before the if statement

Since both achieve the same semantic intent and the difference is purely stylistic, I'll resolve this by choosing the incoming change as it includes the spacing which may have been intentional for readability:

```ruby
  end
end
class Country < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_models
  has_many :companies
  
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :name
  end
end

class NamedScopeModelTest < Test::Unit::TestCase

```
