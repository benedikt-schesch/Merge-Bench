Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - converting symbolic size values (like `:small`, `:medium`, etc.) to their numeric equivalents using the `sizes` hash. The key difference is:

- HEAD version handles both `:size` and `:s` keys as possible size options
- The other branch only handles `:size`

Since the HEAD version is more comprehensive (supporting both `:size` and `:s` as aliases) while still achieving the same intent as the other branch, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version's logic but using the cleaner variable naming from the other branch:

```ruby
  def self.sizes
    { :small => 50, :medium => 100, :large => 150, :big => 150 }
  end
  
  def parse_options(profile, options)
    #pass :gravatar_size through, but translate :size or :s to a number if possible
    result = parse_options_without_size(profile, options)
    [:size, :s].each do |k|
      result[k] = self.class.sizes[options[k]] if self.class.sizes.has_key?(options[k])
    end
    result
  end
  
end
```
