Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define `RE_DOMAIN_TLD` (a regular expression for top-level domains), but with slightly different orderings of the TLD options.

The only difference between the two versions is the order of `com` and `edu`:
- HEAD version: `com|org|net|edu|...`
- Other version: `edu|com|org|net|...`

Since this is a regular expression with alternation (|), the order doesn't affect the functionality - both versions will match the same set of domains. The comment above indicates this is "purposefully imperfect" and just meant as a basic check for bogus input.

Given that the ordering doesn't matter semantically, I'll keep the HEAD version to resolve the conflict cleanly:

```ruby
    # This is purposefully imperfect -- it's just a check for bogus input. See
    # http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html
    RE_EMAIL_NAME   = '[\w\.%\+\-]+'                          # what you actually see in practice
    #RE_EMAIL_NAME   = '0-9A-Z!#\$%\&\'\*\+_/=\?^\-`\{|\}~\.' # technically allowed by RFC-2822
    RE_DOMAIN_HEAD  = '(?:[A-Z0-9\-]+\.)+'
    RE_DOMAIN_TLD   = '(?:[A-Z]{2}|com|org|net|edu|gov|mil|biz|info|mobi|name|aero|jobs|museum)'
    RE_EMAIL_OK     = /\A#{RE_EMAIL_NAME}@#{RE_DOMAIN_HEAD}#{RE_DOMAIN_TLD}\z/i
    MSG_EMAIL_BAD   = "should look like an email address."
    
    CONSTANTS_DEFINED = 'yup' # sorry for the C idiom
  end

```
