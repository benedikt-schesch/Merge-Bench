Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature of `get_page`. 

The HEAD version has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url)
```

While the incoming change has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url: nil)
```

The semantic intent here appears to be that the incoming change is trying to make the `target_url` parameter a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`, which would make it optional. This is a common Ruby pattern for making APIs more flexible.

Given that the method body uses `target_url` directly in the request, and considering modern Ruby best practices favor keyword arguments for clarity, the incoming change appears to be the intended improvement.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of IpAccessControlListInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of IpAccessControlListInstance
            def get_page(target_url: nil)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return IpAccessControlListPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
