Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to add a new test case to what appears to be a list of test names. The conflict shows:

- HEAD wants to add: `opentelemetry_api_can_add_custom_attributes_to_spans`
- The incoming branch wants to add: `opentelemetry_api_can_record_errors`

Since both additions are testing different aspects of the OpenTelemetry API integration (custom attributes vs error recording), and they don't appear to be mutually exclusive, the semantic intent is to include both test cases.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
      creates_opentelemetry_segment_in_a_transaction
      creates_new_relic_span_as_child_of_opentelemetry_span
      does_not_create_segment_without_a_transaction
      starting_transaction_tests
      opentelemetry_api_and_new_relic_api_can_inject_outbound_trace_context
      opentelemetry_api_can_add_custom_attributes_to_spans
      opentelemetry_api_can_record_errors
    ]
  end

  test_cases = load_cross_agent_test('hybrid_agent')
  test_cases.each do |test_case|

```
