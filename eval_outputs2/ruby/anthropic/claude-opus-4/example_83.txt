Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

**HEAD (left side)**: Calls `Twitter::Headers.new` with 3 parameters: `@client, @request_method, @uri`

**Incoming change (right side)**: Calls `Twitter::Headers.new` with 4 parameters: `@client, @request_method, @uri, options || {}`

Looking at the surrounding context, I can see that:
1. In the `else` block below, `Twitter::Headers.new` is called with 4 parameters including `options`
2. The incoming change adds `options || {}` to ensure a hash is always passed even if options is nil

The semantic intent appears to be standardizing the `Twitter::Headers.new` calls to always include the `options` parameter. The HEAD version is missing this parameter in the `:json_put` case, which seems inconsistent with the pattern used elsewhere in the code.

The resolved version should include the `options` parameter for consistency:

```ruby
          merge_multipart_file!(options) if request_method == :multipart_post
          @request_method = :post
          @headers = Twitter::Headers.new(@client, @request_method, @uri).request_headers
        elsif %i[json_put].include?(request_method)
          @request_method = :put
          @headers = Twitter::Headers.new(@client, @request_method, @uri, options || {}).request_headers
        else
          @request_method = request_method
          @headers = Twitter::Headers.new(@client, @request_method, @uri, options).request_headers
        end
      end
```
