Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they both want to define a `get_page` method that takes a `target_url` parameter. The only difference is in the method signature syntax:

- HEAD uses positional parameter syntax: `def get_page(target_url)`
- The other branch uses keyword argument syntax: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks or default value handling, and the comment indicates this is an "API-generated URL", it appears this should be a required parameter. The positional parameter syntax from HEAD is more appropriate for a required parameter.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of OutgoingCallerIdInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of OutgoingCallerIdInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return OutgoingCallerIdPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
