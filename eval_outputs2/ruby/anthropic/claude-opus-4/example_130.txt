Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - asserting that the response contains an error message pattern. The conflict appears to be due to different testing syntax:

- HEAD uses RSpec syntax: `response.should contain(/error(s)? prohibited/)`
- The other branch uses assertion syntax: `assert_match /error(s)? prohibited/m, response.body`

Since both are testing for the same pattern and the file appears to be using Cucumber step definitions, I cannot determine which testing framework is preferred without more context about the project's testing setup. Therefore, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```ruby
# General

Then /^I should see error messages$/ do
<<<<<<< HEAD
  response.should contain(/error(s)? prohibited/)
=======
  assert_match /error(s)? prohibited/m, response.body
>>>>>>> b947402fd2dfbcb9f0a48dcd093a4ebf48653dfb
end

# Database

Given /^no user exists with an email of "(.*)"$/ do |email|

```
