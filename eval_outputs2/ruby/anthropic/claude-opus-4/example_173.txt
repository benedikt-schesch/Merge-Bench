Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature for `get_page`. 

The HEAD version has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url)
```

The incoming change has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url: nil)
```

The semantic intent here appears to be that the incoming change is trying to make the `target_url` parameter a named parameter with a default value of `nil`, which would make it optional. This is a common Ruby pattern for improving API flexibility.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks or conditional logic, and the comment indicates this is for retrieving "a single page" from an "API-generated URL", it seems the parameter should be required. Making it optional with a nil default could lead to runtime errors when `@version.domain.request` is called with a nil URL.

Therefore, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version which maintains the parameter as required:

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of HostedNumberOrderInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of HostedNumberOrderInstance
          def get_page(target_url)
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return HostedNumberOrderPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
