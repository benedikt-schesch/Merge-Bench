Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is adding a deprecation silencing wrapper around the test execution, while the other branch (7b5731cb74066ca5b24ac9d7d168e9bc9f23bd5e) doesn't have this addition.

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants to silence deprecation warnings during the test execution
- The other branch just wants the clean test without the deprecation handling

Since the HEAD branch is adding functionality to handle deprecation warnings (which is likely needed for Rails 7.1.0+ compatibility), and this doesn't conflict with the intent of the test itself, I'll keep the HEAD version:

```ruby
      expectjs("Routes.inboxes()").to eq(test_routes.inboxes_path())
      expectjs("Routes.inbox(2)").to eq(test_routes.inbox_path(2))
    end

    context "with url_links option" do
      around(:each) do |example|
        Rails.version >= "7.1.0" ? Rails.deprecator : ActiveSupport::Deprecation
        deprecator_object.silence do
          example.run
        end
      end

      let(:_options) { { :compact => true, :url_links => true, default_url_options: {host: 'localhost'} } }
      it "should not strip urls" do
        expectjs("Routes.inbox(1)").to eq(test_routes.inbox_path(1))
        expectjs("Routes.inbox_url(1)").to eq("http://localhost#{test_routes.inbox_path(1)}")
      end

```
