Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent from both sides:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Wants to include two require statements for `bundler/audit/results/insecure_source` and `bundler/audit/results/unpatched_gem`
- **Incoming branch (d26e0fd4...)**: Does not include these two require statements

Since this appears to be a difference in dependencies where one side has added new functionality (the results-related requires) and the other side doesn't have them, the semantic intent seems to be that HEAD has introduced new features that require these additional modules.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
require 'bundler'
require 'bundler/audit/configuration'
require 'bundler/audit/database'
require 'bundler/audit/report'
require 'bundler/audit/results/insecure_source'
require 'bundler/audit/results/unpatched_gem'
require 'bundler/lockfile_parser'

require 'ipaddr'
require 'resolv'
require 'set'

```
