Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version has content after `attr_reader :role_symbols` while the incoming branch (`1bc1a86db3ca5e00b733330d7a1404ae6edd30df`) has a blank line after it.

Since both sides have the same code before and after the conflict, and the only difference is the presence/absence of a blank line, the semantic intent is the same - both sides want the `attr_reader :role_symbols` declaration followed by the Rails version check.

The most reasonable resolution is to keep the version without the extra blank line (HEAD version) as it maintains consistent spacing with the rest of the code:

```ruby
  belongs_to :branch
  belongs_to :company
  has_many :test_attr_throughs
  has_many :test_model_security_model_with_finds
  attr_reader :role_symbols
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :test_model, :test_another_model, :attr, :branch, :company, :test_attr,
  	  :test_a_third_model, :n_way_join_item, :n_way_join_item_id, :test_attr_through_id, 
  	  :test_model_id, :test_another_model_id
  end

```
