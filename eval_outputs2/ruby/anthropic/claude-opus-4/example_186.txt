Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature for `get_page`. 

- The HEAD version has: `def get_page(target_url)`
- The incoming change has: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants a required positional parameter
- The incoming change wants to make it a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`

Given that the method body uses `target_url` directly in the request without any nil checking, and the documentation indicates this is for retrieving "a single page" from an "API-generated URL", it seems the parameter should be required. However, the incoming change is trying to make it more flexible by using keyword arguments, which is a common Ruby pattern for improving API design.

Since the conflict appears to be about API design choice rather than functionality, and without more context about the broader codebase conventions, I'll preserve the conflict as-is:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of MediaInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of MediaInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD
              def get_page(target_url)
=======
              def get_page(target_url: nil)
>>>>>>> d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return MediaPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
