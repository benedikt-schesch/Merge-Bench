Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add new file extensions to what appears to be a comment syntax mapping. The HEAD branch is adding VimL support (`.vim` files with `"` as the comment character), while the other branch is adding Markdown support (`.md` files with `<!--` as the comment character).

Since both additions are for different file types and don't conflict with each other semantically, the resolution should include both additions. Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
               '.coffee'  => ['#'],               # CoffeeScript
               '.zsh'     => ['#'],               # Zsh
               '.clj'     => [';;'],              # Clojure
               '.sql'     => ['---', '//', '#' ], # SQL and PL types
               '.lua'     => ['--', '--[['],      # Lua
               '.vim'     => ['"'],               # VimL
               '.md'      => ['<!--'],            # Markdown
               '.html'    => ['<!--']             # HTML
             }

      loop do
        _mtch = filename.match(/(\.(\S+))$/)

```
