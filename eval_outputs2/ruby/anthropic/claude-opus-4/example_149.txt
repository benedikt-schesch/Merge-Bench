Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature of `get_page`. 

The HEAD version has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url)
```

The incoming change has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url: nil)
```

The semantic intent here is clear: the incoming change is converting the positional parameter `target_url` to a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`. This is a common Ruby refactoring pattern that makes the API more explicit and allows for optional parameters.

However, looking at how `target_url` is used in the method body:
```ruby
response = @version.domain.request(
    'GET',
    target_url
)
```

The `target_url` is passed directly to the `request` method, suggesting it's likely a required parameter. The `nil` default value might cause issues if the method is called without arguments.

Given the ambiguity about whether `target_url` should truly be optional (the default `nil` value suggests it might be, but the usage suggests it's required), I'll preserve the conflict as-is:

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of AvailableAddOnInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of AvailableAddOnInstance

            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return AvailableAddOnPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
