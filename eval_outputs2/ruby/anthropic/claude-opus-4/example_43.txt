```ruby
module Ai4r
  module NeuralNetwork
    # Collection of common weight initialization strategies.
    module WeightInitializations
      # Uniform distribution in [-1, 1)
      # @return [Object]
      def self.uniform
        ->(_n, _i, _j) { rand * 2 - 1 }
      end

      # Xavier/Glorot initialization based on layer dimensions
```

The conflict resolution here involves:
1. Adding the `@return [Object]` documentation comment (from the right side)
2. Using `self.uniform` to make it a module method (from the right side)

This resolution makes sense because:
- The module appears to be a collection of weight initialization strategies that should be accessible as module methods
- The documentation comment adds valuable information about the return type
- The `self.` prefix makes this a proper module method that can be called as `WeightInitializations.uniform`
