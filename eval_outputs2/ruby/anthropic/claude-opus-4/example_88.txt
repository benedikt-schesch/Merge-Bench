Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD version has removed some lines that were previously setting up load paths and suppressing warnings
2. The incoming change (032ba1b8bbfc7fc924d369d50b73a219478a6ed0) wants to keep these setup lines
3. Both versions want to keep the require statements that follow

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD: Simplify the setup, possibly because Bundler now handles the load paths
- Incoming: Keep the explicit load path setup and verbose suppression

Since this appears to be a test or spec file setup, and the HEAD version seems to be modernizing by removing redundant load path manipulation (as Bundler typically handles this), I'll resolve in favor of HEAD's simpler approach:

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'bundler/setup'

require 'active_record'
require File.expand_path('../../lib/oauth2/provider', __FILE__)

```
