Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the `xavier` method definition. The conflict is about:

1. **HEAD**: Keeps the method as an instance method (`def xavier(structure)`)
2. **Incoming branch**: Makes it a class method (`def self.xavier(structure)`) and adds documentation comments

Based on the semantic intent, it appears the incoming branch is trying to:
- Convert the method to a class method (which makes sense for an initialization strategy)
- Add proper documentation with `@param` and `@return` tags

Since the method appears to be returning a lambda that's used for initialization (similar to the `random` method above it), making it a class method is likely the correct approach. The documentation also adds value.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```ruby
        ->(_n, _i, _j) { rand * 2 - 1 }
      end

      # Xavier/Glorot initialization based on layer dimensions
      # @param structure [Object]
      # @return [Object]
      def self.xavier(structure)
        lambda do |layer, _i, _j|
          limit = Math.sqrt(6.0 / (structure[layer] + structure[layer + 1]))
          rand * 2 * limit - limit
        end
      end

```
