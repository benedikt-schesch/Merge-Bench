Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle errors in the same code block, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Uses a splat operator with `INTERMITTENT_ERRORS` constant to rescue multiple error types
- **LEFT (ca3a081...)**: Adds a `was_master = am_master` assignment and explicitly lists specific error types to rescue

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to handle connection/network-related errors that can occur during Redis operations
2. The LEFT side also wants to capture the master state in `was_master` variable
3. Both sides handle errors the same way: log the error message and release the master lock

Since `INTERMITTENT_ERRORS` likely contains the same or similar error types as those explicitly listed in the LEFT branch, and the LEFT branch adds the `was_master` assignment which seems intentional, the best resolution is to combine both intents:

```ruby

              if am_master
                handle_delayed_items
                update_schedule if dynamic
              end

              was_master = am_master
            rescue *INTERMITTENT_ERRORS => e
              log! e.message
              release_master_lock
            end
            poll_sleep
          end

```
