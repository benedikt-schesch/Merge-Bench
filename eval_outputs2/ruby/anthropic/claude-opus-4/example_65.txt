Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are calculating a `diff` value, but they have different approaches:

- HEAD (current branch): `diff = t2 - t1`
- Incoming branch: `diff = t2 - t1 - time_in_db`

The incoming branch is subtracting `time_in_db` from the time difference calculation, which suggests it's trying to exclude database time from the overall time measurement. This appears to be a semantic improvement to get a more accurate measure of non-database processing time.

Since the incoming change seems to be a refinement of the time calculation (excluding database time for more accurate performance measurement), and this aligns with the subsequent logic that adjusts `chunksize` based on the `diff` value, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```ruby
			retry
		end

		t2 = Time.now

		diff = t2 - t1 - time_in_db

		new_chunksize = if retries > 0
			chunksize
		elsif diff > 3.0
			(chunksize / 3).ceil
		elsif diff > 1.1

```
