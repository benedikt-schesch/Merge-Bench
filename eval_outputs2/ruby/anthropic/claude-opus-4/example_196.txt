Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same `get_page` method, but with different parameter signatures:

- HEAD version: `def get_page(target_url)` - uses a positional parameter
- Other branch: `def get_page(target_url: nil)` - uses a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both versions want to retrieve a page of ParticipantInstance records using a target URL. The difference is in the method signature style.

Given that:
1. The method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks
2. The comment indicates this parameter is an "API-generated URL for the requested results page" (suggesting it's required)
3. Ruby community often prefers keyword arguments for clarity and future extensibility

The keyword argument approach with `nil` default seems like the better choice as it:
- Provides more flexible calling conventions
- Allows for optional parameter if needed
- Makes the code more explicit at call sites

Here's the resolved version:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of ParticipantInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of ParticipantInstance
              def get_page(target_url: nil)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return ParticipantPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
