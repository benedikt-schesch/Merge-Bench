Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has no content between the comment block and the method definition, while the other branch (08ab5310) has added a blank line between them.

This appears to be a simple formatting difference where one branch added spacing for readability. Since this is purely a stylistic choice with no semantic impact, and the blank line provides better visual separation between the comment and the method, I'll resolve by keeping the version with the blank line.

```ruby
      # Translations and rotations do not cause a 
      # distortion in distance relation (Duda et al, 2001)
      # If attributes are measured with different units, 
      # attributes with larger values and variance will 
      # dominate the metric.

      def euclidean_distance(a, b)
        Math.sqrt(squared_euclidean_distance(a, b))
      end
      
      
```
