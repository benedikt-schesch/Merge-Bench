Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the same method definition, but with different intents:

- HEAD side: Changes the method to an instance method (no `self.`)
- The other side: Adds documentation comments and makes it a class method (with `self.`)

Since the merged branch includes documentation (which is valuable) and explicitly makes this a class method, while HEAD only changes the method signature without documentation, I'll resolve this by keeping the documentation and the class method approach from the merged branch:

```ruby
      # 
      # Some considerations: 
      # * a and b must not include repeated items
      # * all attributes are treated equally
      # * all attributes are treated equally
      # @param a [Object]
      # @param b [Object]
      # @return [Object]
      def self.simple_matching_distance(a,b)
        similarity = 0.0
        a.each {|item| similarity += 2 if b.include?(item)}
        similarity /= (a.length + b.length)
        return 1.0/similarity - 1
      end

```
