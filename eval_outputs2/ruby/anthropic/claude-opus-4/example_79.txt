Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - defining an options hash with the same key-value pairs. The only difference is the syntax style:

- HEAD uses the older Ruby hash rocket syntax (`:key => value`)
- The incoming change uses the newer Ruby 1.9+ syntax (`key: value`)

Since both sides have identical intent and semantics, and the newer syntax is generally preferred in modern Ruby code, I'll resolve this by using the newer syntax:

```ruby

      protected
      
      def s3connect!
        options = {
          access_key_id: @access_key_id,
          secret_access_key: @secret_access_key,
          use_ssl: true
        }

        options[:server] = @host if @host
        AWS::S3::Base.establish_connection!(options) unless AWS::S3::Base.connected?
      end

```
