Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the `get_page` method signature, but with different approaches:

- HEAD version: `def get_page(target_url)` - uses a positional parameter
- Incoming version: `def get_page(target_url: nil)` - uses a keyword argument with a default value

The semantic intent appears to be making the `target_url` parameter more flexible. The incoming change converts it to a keyword argument with a default of `nil`, which would make the method more flexible and allow calls without explicitly passing the parameter.

However, looking at the method body, `target_url` is used directly in the request without any nil checking, suggesting it's actually required. The better resolution would be to keep it as a required parameter but use the more modern Ruby keyword argument syntax without the default value.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of IncomingPhoneNumberInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of IncomingPhoneNumberInstance
            def get_page(target_url:)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return IncomingPhoneNumberPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
