Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the `get_page` method signature, but with different approaches:

- HEAD version: `def get_page(target_url)` - uses a positional parameter
- Incoming version: `def get_page(target_url: nil)` - uses a keyword parameter with a default value of `nil`

The semantic intent appears to be making the `target_url` parameter more flexible. The incoming change converts it to a keyword parameter with a default value, which is generally considered better Ruby practice as it:
1. Makes the method call more explicit and self-documenting
2. Allows for optional parameters
3. Makes the API more flexible for future changes

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any nil checks, and the comment indicates this is for retrieving "API-generated URL for the requested results page", it seems the parameter is required for the method to function properly. Therefore, the keyword parameter approach with `nil` default might be part of a larger refactoring effort.

I'll resolve this by accepting the incoming change (keyword parameter version) as it represents a more modern Ruby API design:

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of CredentialInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of CredentialInstance
          def get_page(target_url: nil)
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return CredentialPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
