Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature for `get_page`. 

The HEAD version has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url)
```

The incoming change has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url: nil)
```

The semantic intent here appears to be:
- HEAD: Expects `target_url` as a required positional parameter
- Incoming: Wants to make `target_url` an optional keyword parameter with a default value of `nil`

Given that the method body uses `target_url` directly in the request without any nil checks or default handling, and considering this appears to be retrieving a specific page from an API-generated URL, it seems the parameter should be required. The incoming change to make it optional with `nil` default doesn't align with how the method is used.

Therefore, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of CountryInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of CountryInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return CountryPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
