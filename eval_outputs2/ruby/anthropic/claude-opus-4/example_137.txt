Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Has the basic initialization of variables without the Rails check
- Incoming branch: Adds a check for whether Rails is defined and stores it in `@has_rails`

The incoming change appears to be adding functionality to detect if the code is running in a Rails environment, which is likely used later in the code. This is a common pattern in Ruby libraries that need to behave differently when running inside vs outside of Rails.

Since this is an additive change that doesn't conflict with the existing code's intent, the semantic resolution is to include the Rails detection:

```ruby
    headerA = []
    result = []
    old_row_sep = $/
    @file_line_count = 0
    @csv_line_count = 0
    @has_rails = !! defined?(Rails)

    begin
      f = input.respond_to?(:readline) ? input : File.open(input, "r:#{options[:file_encoding]}")

      if (options[:force_utf8] || options[:file_encoding] =~ /utf-8/i) && ( f.respond_to?(:external_encoding) && f.external_encoding != Encoding.find('UTF-8') || f.respond_to?(:encoding) && f.encoding != Encoding.find('UTF-8') )

```
