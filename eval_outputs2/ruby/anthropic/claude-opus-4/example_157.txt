Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature of `get_page`. 

The HEAD version has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url)
```

The incoming change has:
```ruby
def get_page(target_url: nil)
```

The semantic intent here is clear: the incoming change is converting the positional parameter `target_url` to a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`. This is a common Ruby refactoring pattern that makes APIs more explicit and flexible.

Since the method body uses `target_url` directly without any modification, and keyword arguments in Ruby can be used the same way as positional arguments within the method body, the resolution should accept the incoming change.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of ConnectAppInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of ConnectAppInstance
            def get_page(target_url: nil)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return ConnectAppPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
