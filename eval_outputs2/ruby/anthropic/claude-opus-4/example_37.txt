Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same method `euclidean_distance`, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Defines it as an instance method
- **Other branch (753f2ec)**: Defines it as a class method (`self.`) and adds YARD documentation

Since both implementations have the same method body and the conflict is about whether this should be an instance or class method, I cannot determine the correct intent without more context about how this method is used in the codebase. The addition of documentation on one side suggests that branch was trying to improve the code documentation, but the fundamental question of instance vs. class method remains ambiguous.

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```ruby
      # Translations and rotations do not cause a 
      # distortion in distance relation (Duda et al, 2001)
      # If attributes are measured with different units, 
      # attributes with larger values and variance will 
      # dominate the metric.

      def euclidean_distance(a, b)

      # @param a [Object]
      # @param b [Object]
      # @return [Object]
      def self.euclidean_distance(a, b)

        Math.sqrt(squared_euclidean_distance(a, b))
      end
      
      
      # city block, Manhattan distance, or L1 norm.
