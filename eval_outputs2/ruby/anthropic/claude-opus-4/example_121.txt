Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to assert that the task's `updated_at` timestamp should be close to the current time, but they're using different RSpec matcher syntax:

- HEAD uses the older `be_close(Time.now, 5)` syntax (within 5 seconds)
- The incoming change uses the newer `be_within(1).of(Time.now)` syntax (within 1 second)

The `be_within().of()` syntax is the modern RSpec way of expressing this assertion, and the incoming change is also using a tighter tolerance (1 second vs 5 seconds), which suggests it's a more precise test.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
      conversation = Factory.create(:conversation, :simple => false, :created_at => 2.hours.ago, :updated_at => 1.hour.ago)

      task = conversation.convert_to_task!

      task.should_not be_nil
      task.updated_at.should be_within(1).of(Time.now)
    end

    it "and when converted to a task, the comments should be transferred to the task" do
      conversation = Factory.build(:conversation, :simple => false)
      conversation.comments_attributes = {"0" => { :body => "Just sayin' hi" }}

```
