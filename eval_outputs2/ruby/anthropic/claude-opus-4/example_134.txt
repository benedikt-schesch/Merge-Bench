Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add the `association` to a collection, but they're using different instance variable names:
- HEAD uses `@join_parts`
- The incoming change uses `@joins`

Without more context about the broader codebase changes, I cannot definitively determine which instance variable name is correct. The semantic intent is the same (adding the association to a collection), but the naming convention has changed between the two branches.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```ruby
            association = PolymorphicJoinAssociation.new(reflection, self, klass, parent)
          else
            association = build_join_association(reflection, parent)
          end
          association.join_type = join_type
<<<<<<< HEAD
          @join_parts << association
=======
          @joins << association
>>>>>>> 5df8ae16e28501c35b5681da6563eba6bff0ffb6
          cache_joined_association(association)
        end
        association
      else
        build_without_metawhere(associations, parent, join_type)
```
