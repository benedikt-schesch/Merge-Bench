Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to add the same `track_history` parameter to what appears to be a hash or method call. The only difference is the syntax style:

- HEAD uses the newer Ruby hash syntax with `key: value`
- The incoming change uses the older hash syntax with `:key => value`

Since the HEAD version uses the modern Ruby syntax that's consistent with the other parameters in the snippet (like `init_method:` and `restarts:`), I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```ruby
          "generator when selecting random centroids.",
        init_method: "Strategy to initialize centroids. Available values: " +
          ":random (default) and :kmeans_plus_plus.",
        restarts: "Number of random initializations to perform. " +
          "The best run (lowest SSE) will be kept.",
        track_history: "Keep centroids and assignments for each iteration " +
          "when building the clusterer."
      )
      
      # @return [Object]
      def initialize
        @distance_function = nil

```
