Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the conflict is about whether to include a blank line after the comment block. 

The HEAD version has no blank line between the comments and the method definition, while the other branch (08ab5310c30a528313f03790c68868941ad26101) adds a blank line for better readability.

Since the semantic intent is the same in both versions (just formatting), and adding a blank line between comments and method definitions is generally considered good practice for readability, I'll resolve this by keeping the blank line.

```ruby
      # 
      # Some considerations: 
      # * a and b must not include repeated items
      # * all attributes are treated equally
      # * all attributes are treated equally

      def simple_matching_distance(a,b)
        similarity = 0.0
        a.each {|item| similarity += 2 if b.include?(item)}
        similarity /= (a.length + b.length)
        return 1.0/similarity - 1

```
