Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that HEAD has content (no empty line after the `track_history` option) while the other branch (04a32250473b3e60f6d76662bdf3198fc2e768d2) has added an empty line after the `track_history` option.

This appears to be a formatting/style conflict. The intent from the second branch seems to be to add spacing between the options hash and the subsequent code. This is a common style choice to improve readability.

Here's the resolved version that accepts the empty line addition for better code formatting:

```ruby
          ":random (default) and :kmeans_plus_plus.",
        restarts: "Number of random initializations to perform. " +
          "The best run (lowest SSE) will be kept.",
        track_history: "Keep centroids and assignments for each iteration " +
          "when building the clusterer."

      )
      
      # @return [Object]
      def initialize
        @distance_function = nil
```
