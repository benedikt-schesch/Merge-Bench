Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add new file extensions and their associated comment styles to what appears to be a hash/dictionary of file types and comment delimiters.

The HEAD branch adds:
- `.el` (Emacs Lisp) with comment delimiter `;`

The incoming branch (5fe681b...) adds:
- `.sqf` (SQF) with comment delimiters `//` and `/*`
- `.sqs` (SQS) with comment delimiter `;`
- `.d` (D programming language) with comment delimiters `//` and `/*`

Since both sides are simply adding new entries to the same data structure and there's no actual conflict in terms of overlapping keys or contradictory values, the semantic resolution is to include all the additions from both sides.

```ruby
               '.sql'     => ['---', '//', '#' ], # SQL and PL types
               '.lua'     => ['--', '--[['],      # Lua
               '.vim'     => ['"'],               # VimL
               '.md'      => ['<!--'],            # Markdown
               '.html'    => ['<!--'],            # HTML
               '.el'      => [';'],               # Emacslisp
               '.sqf'     => ['//','/*'],         # SQF
               '.sqs'     => [';'],               # SQS
               '.d'       => ['//','/*']          # D
             }

      # Merge config file type list with defaults
      _ext.merge!(@config.type_list)
      

```
