Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the same `StandardError` rescue block, but with slightly different approaches:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Calls `job.reschedule` with just the error message, and uses a `log_exception` helper method
- **Right side**: Calls `job.reschedule` with both the error message and backtrace, and manually logs the error details

The semantic intent of both sides is to:
1. Reschedule the job when an error occurs
2. Log the error information

The right side appears to be more explicit and comprehensive by:
- Including the backtrace in the reschedule call (which could be important for debugging)
- Providing more detailed error logging with attempt count
- Logging the error object directly

Here's the resolved conflict that combines the best of both approaches:

```ruby

          return job
        rescue LockError
          # We did not get the lock, some other worker process must have
          logger.warn "* [JOB] failed to aquire exclusive lock for #{job.name}"
        rescue StandardError => e
          job.reschedule e.message, e.backtrace
          logger.error "* [JOB] #{job.name} failed with #{e.class.name}: #{e.message} - #{job.attempts} failed attempts"
          logger.error(e)
          return job
        end
      end

      nil

```
