The conflict involves the use of single quotes vs double quotes in a version check condition. Since both branches intend to conditionally define `attr_accessible` for Rails versions below 4, and the surrounding code consistently uses double quotes, the resolution adopts double quotes for consistency.

```ruby
  has_one :test_attr_has_one, :class_name => "TestAttr"
  has_one :test_attr_throughs_with_attr_and_has_one, :through => :test_attrs,
    :class_name => "TestAttrThrough", :source => :test_attr_throughs,
    :conditions => "test_attrs.attr = 1"

  if Rails.version < "4"
    attr_accessible :content, :test_attr_through_id, :country_id
  end

  # TODO currently not working in Rails 3
  if Rails.version < "3"

```
