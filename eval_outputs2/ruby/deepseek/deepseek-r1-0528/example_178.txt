The conflict arises from differing method signatures for `get_page`. The HEAD branch uses a required positional parameter, while the other branch uses an optional keyword parameter with a default value. Since the method body immediately uses `target_url` in an API request without nil-checking, making it optional could introduce errors if called without the parameter. However, the intent behind converting to a keyword parameter (e.g., API consistency or future flexibility) is unclear from the context. 

Given the ambiguity and risk of introducing unexpected behavior, the conflict remains unresolved. Here's the original snippet with the conflict markers:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of InviteInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of InviteInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD
              def get_page(target_url)
=======
              def get_page(target_url: nil)
>>>>>>> d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return InvitePage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
