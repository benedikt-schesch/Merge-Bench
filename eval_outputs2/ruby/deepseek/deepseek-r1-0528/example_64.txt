```ruby

		retries = 0
		time_in_db = 0
		begin
			t1 = Time.now
<<<<<<< HEAD
			yield chunksize
=======
			time_in_db = yield chunksize
			time_in_db = time_in_db.to_f rescue 0
>>>>>>> a4449f2eb4e6c25811b857fc1a6d6501831b7cde
		rescue Errno::EPIPE, RestClient::RequestFailed
			retries += 1
			raise if retries > 2

			# we got disconnected, the chunksize could be too large

```

The conflict cannot be automatically resolved because:
1. The HEAD version discards the yield result and doesn't update `time_in_db`
2. The other branch captures the yield result and converts it to float
3. The surrounding code shows `time_in_db` is initialized and potentially used later
4. There's insufficient context to determine if the yield should return a value
5. The semantic purpose of tracking `time_in_db` vs not tracking is ambiguous
6. Both changes represent fundamentally different execution paths

The resolution requires understanding:
- What the block passed to this method does
- Why the other branch added time conversion
- Why HEAD removed the assignment
- How `time_in_db` is used later in the code
- Whether `t1` is used for timing calculations

Since the intent is ambiguous and we lack sufficient context, the conflict is preserved.
