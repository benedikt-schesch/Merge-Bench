The conflict arises from a difference in string quotes and whitespace formatting. Both changes intend to conditionally define `attr_accessible` for Rails versions below 4. The semantics are identical, so the resolution preserves the conditional while standardizing the quote style to match surrounding code conventions.

Resolved code:
```ruby
  end
end
class Country < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_models
  has_many :companies
  if Rails.version < "4"
    attr_accessible :name
  end
end

class NamedScopeModelTest < Test::Unit::TestCase

```
