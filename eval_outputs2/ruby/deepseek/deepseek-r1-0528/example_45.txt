I've analyzed the merge conflict and determined that both sides are semantically equivalent. The only difference is an extra blank line in the conflicting branch. Here's the resolved version:

```ruby
      #
      # Evaluation does not update internal statistics, keeping the
      # classifier state unchanged. Use +update_with_instance+ to
      # incorporate new samples.
      def eval(data)
        neighbors = @data_set.data_items.map do |train_item|
          [distance(data, train_item), train_item.last]
        end
        neighbors.sort_by! { |d, _| d }
        k_limit = [@k, @data_set.data_items.length].min
        k_neighbors = neighbors.first(k_limit)


```

Resolution reasoning:
1. Both versions compute the same `neighbors` array mapping
2. The content inside the block is identical
3. The extra blank line in the conflicting branch doesn't affect functionality
4. The HEAD version is cleaner without unnecessary whitespace
5. All surrounding context is preserved exactly as provided
6. The solution maintains the original spacing and formatting outside the conflict region
