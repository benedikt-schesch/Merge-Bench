The merge conflict involves conflicting changes to attribute declarations in the `Client` class. The HEAD branch added three new attributes (`timer`, `control_uri`, and `control`), while the other branch (7ba5425) removed them entirely. Since there's no additional context about why these attributes were added or removed, and the intent behind both changes is unclear, I'm unable to safely resolve this conflict. The code is returned with conflict markers intact.

```ruby
  # view the TweetStream::Daemon class.
  class Client

    # @private
    attr_accessor *Configuration::VALID_OPTIONS_KEYS
<<<<<<< HEAD
    attr_accessor :timer
    attr_reader :control_uri
    attr_reader :control

>>>>>>> 7ba5425c6c4369c537c25fce6dd5f1aaf6e5b6c4

    # Creates a new API
    def initialize(options={})
      options = TweetStream.options.merge(options)
      Configuration::VALID_OPTIONS_KEYS.each do |key|
```
