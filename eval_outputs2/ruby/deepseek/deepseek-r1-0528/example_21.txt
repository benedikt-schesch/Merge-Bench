Here's the resolved code snippet by combining both additions with proper comma usage and preserving context:

```ruby
               '.sql'     => ['---', '//', '#' ], # SQL and PL types
               '.lua'     => ['--', '--[['],      # Lua
               '.vim'     => ['"'],               # VimL
               '.md'      => ['<!--'],            # Markdown
               '.html'    => ['<!--'],            # HTML
               '.el'      => [';'],               # Emacslisp
               '.sqf'     => ['//','/*'],         # SQF
               '.sqs'     => [';'],               # SQS
               '.d'       => ['//','/*']          # D
             }

      # Merge config file type list with defaults
      _ext.merge!(@config.type_list)
      
```

Rationale:
1. Both branches add new file extension mappings that don't conflict
2. Maintained all entries from both branches:
   - HEAD adds `.el` (EmacsLisp)
   - Other branch adds `.sqf`, `.sqs`, and `.d`
3. Fixed comma usage:
   - Added comma after `.el` entry since it's no longer last
   - Kept commas in other branch entries as originally formatted
4. Preserved:
   - Original comments
   - Hash syntax and formatting
   - Indentation and spacing
   - Closing brace position
   - Following context lines

The resolution combines both semantic additions while maintaining valid Ruby syntax and preserving all functionality from both branches.
