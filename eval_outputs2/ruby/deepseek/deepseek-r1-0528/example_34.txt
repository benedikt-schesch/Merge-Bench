I've analyzed the merge conflict and resolved it by preserving the semantic intent of both changes. The conflict was about whether to include a service restart notification after setting up the web app configuration.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```ruby
    template "web_app.conf.erb"
    server_name site["host"]
    server_aliases site["aliases"]
    server_include site["include"]
    docroot site["docroot"]?site["docroot"]:"/vagrant/public/#{site["host"]}"
    notifies :restart, resources("service[apache2]"), :delayed
  end

   # Add site info in /etc/hosts
   bash "hosts" do
     code "echo 127.0.0.1 #{site["host"]} #{site["aliases"].join(' ')} >> /etc/hosts"
```

Reasoning:
1. The `notifies` directive ensures Apache restarts when configuration changes
2. This is a safe addition that maintains functionality from both branches
3. The service restart should be delayed to avoid unnecessary restarts during convergence
4. The indentation and syntax are preserved exactly as in the original conflict markers

The resolution maintains:
- Web app configuration from both branches
- Hosts file management
- Proper Chef resource notification pattern
- Original formatting and spacing
