The merge conflict remains unresolved due to ambiguity in the intent behind the conflicting changes. The HEAD branch includes a patch call and explicit return, while the other branch omits both. Without additional context to determine if the patch is necessary or if the explicit return is required, it's unsafe to assume either version is correct.

Here is the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```ruby
      end
      
      # Connect to gmail service. 
      def connect(raise_errors=false)
        @imap = Net::IMAP.new(GMAIL_IMAP_HOST, GMAIL_IMAP_PORT, true, nil, false)
<<<<<<< HEAD
        GmailImapExtensions.patch_net_imap_response_parser
        @imap
=======
>>>>>>> da8cc3138c7c02c6a57c922c04da964e7b333544
      rescue SocketError
        raise_errors and raise ConnectionError, "Couldn't establish connection with GMail IMAP service"
      end
      
      # This version of connect will raise error on failure...
```

Key points maintaining ambiguity:
1. **Patch necessity**: The `GmailImapExtensions.patch_net_imap_response_parser` might be critical functionality added in HEAD, or obsolete in the other branch
2. **Return value**: Explicit `@imap` return (HEAD) vs implicit return value (other branch) have identical behavior in Ruby
3. **Safety**: Removing the patch could break functionality, while keeping it might introduce unnecessary dependencies

Resolution requires additional context about:
- Purpose of `GmailImapExtensions.patch_net_imap_response_parser`
- Whether the patch is idempotent/safe for multiple calls
- Compatibility requirements with other parts of the system
