The merge conflict arises from a minor whitespace difference. Both versions are functionally identical, with the only difference being an extra newline in the other branch. The HEAD version without the extra newline is preserved since it maintains consistent formatting with the surrounding context.

Resolved code:
```ruby
      end
      
      # Sup distance, or L-intinity norm
      # Parameters a and b are vectors with continuous attributes.      
      def sup_distance(a, b)
        distance = 0.0
        a.each_with_index do |item_a, i|
          item_b = b[i]
          diff = (item_a - item_b).abs
          distance = diff if diff > distance
```
