The merge conflict arises from differing method signatures for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument `target_url`, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument with a default value of `nil`. 

After analyzing:
1. The method body requires `target_url` for the GET request
2. The parameter documentation specifies it as required
3. The keyword argument version introduces a default `nil` that could lead to runtime errors
4. There's no additional context showing why the keyword argument was introduced
5. The method semantics clearly require a non-nil URL

The resolution keeps the required positional argument from HEAD since it:
- Matches the documented requirement
- Avoids introducing a potential nil URL error
- Preserves current callers' expectations
- Maintains consistency with the method's core purpose

Resolved code:
```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of FaxInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of FaxInstance
          def get_page(target_url)
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return FaxPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
