The merge conflict involves two different error handling approaches for `StandardError` in the same rescue block. The HEAD version uses a `log_exception` method and passes only the error message to `job.reschedule`, while the other branch adds detailed logging directly and passes both message and backtrace to `job.reschedule`.

Since the intent is ambiguous (the HEAD version's `log_exception` method isn't defined in this snippet, and the other branch introduces new logging logic), I cannot safely resolve this conflict without more context. Both versions:
1. Differ in `job.reschedule` arguments
2. Have different logging implementations
3. Contain unique error-handling details

Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```ruby

          return job
        rescue LockError
          # We did not get the lock, some other worker process must have
          logger.warn "* [JOB] failed to aquire exclusive lock for #{job.name}"
<<<<<<< HEAD
        rescue StandardError => e 
          job.reschedule e.message        
          log_exception(job, e)
=======
        rescue StandardError => e
          job.reschedule e.message, e.backtrace
          logger.error "* [JOB] #{job.name} failed with #{e.class.name}: #{e.message} - #{job.attempts} failed attempts"
          logger.error(e)

          return job
        end
      end

      nil
