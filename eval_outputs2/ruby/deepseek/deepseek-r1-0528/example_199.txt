The conflict arises from differing method signatures for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument. However, the method body requires `target_url` to make the API request. Since the parameter is documented as required and the method would fail if `target_url` is nil, the positional argument is more appropriate. 

Here's the resolved snippet:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of PublicKeyInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of PublicKeyInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return PublicKeyPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
