The merge conflict involves two independent changes that can be safely combined since they operate on different tables. The HEAD adds an index to the `stages` table, while the other branch introduces a new `user_project_links` table. Both changes are valid and non-overlapping.

Resolved code:
```ruby
    t.text     "alert_emails"
    t.integer  "locked_by_deployment_id"
    t.integer  "locked",                  :default => 0
  end

  add_index "stages", ["project_id"], :name => "index_stages_on_project_id"

  create_table "user_project_links", :force => true do |t|
    t.integer  "user_id"
    t.integer  "project_id"
    t.datetime "created_at"
    t.datetime "updated_at"
  end

  create_table "users", :force => true do |t|
    t.string   "login"
    t.string   "email"
    t.string   "crypted_password",          :limit => 40
```

Changes made:
1. Kept `add_index` from HEAD (properly placed right after `stages` table definition)
2. Kept `create_table` for `user_project_links` from the other branch
3. Preserved the original structure and spacing
4. Maintained the correct order: stages index → new table → users table

This resolution:
- Maintains the index on `stages` for performance
- Adds the new join table `user_project_links`
- Preserves the original context formatting
- Keeps all table definitions in logical order
