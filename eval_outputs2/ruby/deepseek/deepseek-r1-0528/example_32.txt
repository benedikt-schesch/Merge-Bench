The merge conflict involves an autoload statement for CSV that exists in the HEAD branch but is absent in the other branch (3b462d3). Since there's no additional context about why the CSV autoload was removed in the other branch or whether its inclusion in HEAD is intentional, the intent is ambiguous. 

Without clear semantic context to determine if this line should be preserved or removed, the conflict remains unresolved. Here's the unchanged code snippet with the conflict markers:

```ruby
  autoload(:Validation, File.join(DIR, 'sciruby', 'validation'))
  autoload(:Data, File.join(DIR, 'sciruby', 'data'))
end

autoload(:Shoes, File.join(SciRuby::DIR, 'ext', 'shoes'))
<<<<<<< HEAD
autoload(:CSV, File.join(SciRuby::DIR, 'ext', 'csv'))
=======
>>>>>>> 3b462d352bfeef53e779c5d9b6d3a1b57f32149a
