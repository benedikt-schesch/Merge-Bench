The merge conflict centers on the method signature for `get_page`. The HEAD branch uses a required positional argument `target_url`, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument `target_url: nil`. 

Key observations:
1. The method requires `target_url` to function (used in the GET request)
2. The documentation states it's a required API-generated URL
3. The method body lacks `nil` handling for `target_url`
4. Changing the signature breaks compatibility with callers from either branch

Since the conflict involves incompatible calling conventions and there's insufficient context to determine which convention should prevail, the conflict remains unresolved. The surrounding context is preserved exactly as provided.

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of EventInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of EventInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD

              )
