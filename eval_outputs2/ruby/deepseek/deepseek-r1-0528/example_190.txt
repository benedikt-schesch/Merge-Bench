Based on the analysis of the semantic intent and potential consequences of both changes, I've determined that the conflict should be resolved by keeping the required positional parameter. The keyword argument with a default value of `nil` introduces a risk of runtime errors since the method body doesn't handle a nil `target_url`. Here's the resolved version:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of MobileInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of MobileInstance
              def get_page(target_url)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return MobilePage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```

Key reasons for this resolution:
1. The method requires `target_url` to function correctly (as per the documentation)
2. The method body doesn't contain nil-checking logic
3. Making the parameter optional could lead to runtime errors
4. The documentation specifies this as a required parameter
5. Preserves backward compatibility with existing callers

The resolution maintains the original context and spacing while removing the merge conflict markers.
