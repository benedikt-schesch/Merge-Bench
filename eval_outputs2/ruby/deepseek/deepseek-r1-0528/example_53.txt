```ruby
    # This module provides classical distance functions
    module Proximity
      
      # This is a faster computational replacement for eclidean distance.
      # Parameters a and b are vectors with continuous attributes.
      # @param a [Object]
      # @param b [Object]
      # @return [Object]
      def self.squared_euclidean_distance(a, b)
        sum = 0.0
        a.each_with_index do |item_a, i|
          item_b = b[i]
          sum += (item_a - item_b)**2
        end
```

I've resolved the conflict by:
1. Keeping the yardoc comments added in the branch commit (08ab531) for better documentation
2. Maintaining the `self.` prefix to make it a class method as intended in the branch commit
3. Preserving the method body unchanged since it was identical in both versions
4. Maintaining all surrounding context and spacing exactly as provided

The resolution maintains the semantic intent of both sides:
- The HEAD commit's method implementation is preserved
- The branch commit's documentation improvements and class method design are incorporated
- The module remains a namespace for distance functions as originally designed
