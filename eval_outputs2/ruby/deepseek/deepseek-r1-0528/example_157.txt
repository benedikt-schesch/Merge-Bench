The conflict arises from a difference in method parameter definition. The HEAD branch uses a required positional parameter, while the other branch uses an optional keyword parameter with a default value of `nil`. 

However, the method implementation requires a valid `target_url` to function correctly, as it's passed directly to the HTTP request. The keyword parameter approach with default `nil` could lead to errors if called without arguments. Since the comment indicates `target_url` is required ("API-generated URL for the requested results page"), the positional parameter is more appropriate to enforce this requirement.

Resolved version maintains the positional parameter for safety and clarity:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of ConnectAppInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of ConnectAppInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return ConnectAppPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
