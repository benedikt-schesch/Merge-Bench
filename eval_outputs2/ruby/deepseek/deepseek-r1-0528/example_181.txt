The conflict arises from differing method signatures for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument with a default value. 

After analyzing the semantics:
1. The method requires `target_url` to function (it's used directly in the API request)
2. The parameter is described as "API-generated URL" in the comment, implying it should always be provided
3. The method body doesn't handle `nil` values for `target_url`

The resolution maintains the required positional argument since:
- The keyword argument approach introduces optionality that isn't supported by the implementation
- There's no evidence of callers needing to omit this parameter
- The current implementation expects a non-nil value

Resolved version:
```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of IpAccessControlListMappingInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of IpAccessControlListMappingInstance
                def get_page(target_url)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return IpAccessControlListMappingPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
