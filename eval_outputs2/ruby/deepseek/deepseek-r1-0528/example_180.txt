The merge conflict arises from differing method signatures for `get_page`. The HEAD branch uses a required positional argument `(target_url)`, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument `(target_url: nil)`. 

Given the context:
1. The method unconditionally uses `target_url` in the request
2. The parameter is documented as required ("API-generated URL")
3. Making it optional would risk nil errors without additional validation
4. The method's purpose is to fetch a specific page, which requires a URL

The resolution preserves the required argument since both versions semantically require a URL. The optional keyword approach introduces risk without supporting changes. The HEAD version's positional argument is selected as it safely enforces the requirement.

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of AlertInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of AlertInstance
          def get_page(target_url)
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return AlertPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
