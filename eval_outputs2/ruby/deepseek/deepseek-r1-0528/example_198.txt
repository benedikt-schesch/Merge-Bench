The conflict arises from differing method signatures for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument. The method body requires `target_url` to be provided (as it's passed directly to the request). Since the method fundamentally relies on this parameter, the required positional argument is semantically correct and avoids potential nil errors. 

Resolved code:
```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of PhoneNumberInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of PhoneNumberInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return PhoneNumberPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
