Since the intent behind the two conflicting method signatures is ambiguous without additional context, and the parameter format change (positional vs keyword argument) could have significant implications throughout the codebase, the conflict remains unresolved. The surrounding context is preserved exactly as provided.

            # @return [Page] Page of CallInstance
