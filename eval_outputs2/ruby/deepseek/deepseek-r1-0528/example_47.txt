The merge conflict arises from differing whitespace formatting after the `track_history` option. Both branches have identical option definitions, but the conflicting branch introduces an extra newline before the closing parenthesis. Since the content is semantically the same and the extra newline doesn't affect functionality, we resolve by keeping the more compact formatting (without the extra newline) for consistency with the existing style.

```ruby
          ":random (default) and :kmeans_plus_plus.",
        restarts: "Number of random initializations to perform. " +
          "The best run (lowest SSE) will be kept.",
        track_history: "Keep centroids and assignments for each iteration " +
          "when building the clusterer."

      # @return [Object]
      def initialize
        @distance_function = nil
