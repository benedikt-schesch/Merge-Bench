Here's the resolved code snippet based on semantic intent analysis. The conflict was about formatting differences in a Rails version check, while both sides maintained identical functionality. The resolution preserves the blank line for readability and uses single quotes for consistency with Ruby conventions for static strings:

```ruby
  end
end
class Country < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_models
  has_many :companies

  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :name
  end
end

class NamedScopeModelTest < Test::Unit::TestCase

```

Key resolution rationale:
1. Both sides intended identical functionality (conditional `attr_accessible`)
2. Blank line preserved from branch version for better visual separation
3. Single quotes adopted from branch version (Ruby convention for static strings)
4. Context before/after conflict remains unchanged
5. Rails version check logic remains functionally identical

The resolution maintains the semantic intent of both branches while improving readability.
