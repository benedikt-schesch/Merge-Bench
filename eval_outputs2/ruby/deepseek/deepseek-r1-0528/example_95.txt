Based on the semantic analysis, both sides are trying to verify the same redirection behavior after login. The difference is purely syntactic - one uses a named route helper while the other uses explicit controller/action parameters. Since both achieve the same semantic outcome and the HEAD version uses more modern Rails conventions, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the named route helper.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```ruby
    get "/login"
    assert_response :success
    post "/login", :user=>{:login => users(:user).login, :password => 'test'}
    assert_response :redirect
    assert session[:user]
    assert_redirected_to profile_url(users(:user).profile)
    follow_redirect!
  
    #   puts @response.body
    spider(@response.body, "/", false)
  end
```

Key resolution points:
1. Both versions verify redirection to the user's profile
2. `profile_url` helper is equivalent to `:controller=>'profiles', :action=>'show'`
3. The HEAD version uses Rails' conventional route helpers
4. The explicit parameter version adds no new semantic value
5. Spacing and surrounding context preserved exactly as provided
