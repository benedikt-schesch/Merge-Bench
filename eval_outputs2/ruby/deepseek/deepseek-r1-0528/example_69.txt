I'll help resolve this merge conflict while preserving the context exactly. Here's the analysis:

The conflict occurs after an update operation where both branches want to display output only when not in quiet mode. However, the two branches implement different behaviors:

1. **HEAD branch**: Calls `stats(path)` method
2. **Other branch**: Prints advisory count message directly

These appear to be conflicting implementations rather than complementary changes. Since:
- The `stats` method's implementation isn't visible
- The advisory count message references a specific database
- Both are trying to occupy the same logical position
- The intent isn't clearly reconcilable

I'll keep the conflict markers since the semantics are ambiguous:

```ruby
          exit 1
        when nil
          say "Skipping update", :yellow
        end

<<<<<<< HEAD
        stats(path) unless options.quiet?
=======
        unless options.quiet?
          puts "ruby-advisory-db: #{Database.new.size} advisories"
        end
>>>>>>> d26e0fd4ff525414e8c814ce549e3fd639e0329d
      end

      desc 'version', 'Prints the bundler-audit version'
      def version
        database = Database.new
```

The surrounding context is preserved exactly as provided, including spacing and indentation. The conflict remains because we can't determine whether:
1. The `stats` method should be replaced
2. The output should be combined
3. One approach should supersede the other

Without seeing the implementation of `stats()` or having more context about the desired output, this conflict requires human decision-making.
