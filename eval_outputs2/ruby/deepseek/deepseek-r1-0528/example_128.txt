The conflict involves a minor whitespace difference that doesn't impact functionality. Both versions are semantically identical. The resolution maintains consistency with the surrounding code's single-space convention while preserving alignment.

Resolved code:
```ruby
    end
  end

  describe 'when locating beverages with out a dish' do
    let!(:beverage) { create(:coke) }
    let(:response) { ModelHelper.response(Beverage, dish_id: nil) }

    it_behaves_like 'fastapi_meta' do
      let(:expected) { { total: 1, count: 1, offset: 0, error: false } }
    end
