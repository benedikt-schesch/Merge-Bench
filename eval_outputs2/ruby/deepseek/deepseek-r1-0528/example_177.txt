The conflict arises from differing method signatures for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument, while the other branch uses a keyword argument with a default value. After analyzing the context:

1. The method documentation clearly states `target_url` is required
2. The method body uses `target_url` without any nil-checking
3. The keyword argument version introduces optionality that isn't handled in the method implementation
4. The surrounding context shows consistent use of required arguments

The positional argument approach (HEAD) better matches:
- The method's documented requirements
- The implementation's assumptions
- The existing code patterns

Here's the resolved snippet:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of InteractionInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of InteractionInstance
              def get_page(target_url)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return InteractionPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
