**Reasoning for preserving conflict:**  
The conflict involves incompatible method signatures:
1. HEAD uses a required positional argument (`target_url`)
2. The other branch uses an optional keyword argument (`target_url: nil`)

The method body uses `target_url` without nil-checking, suggesting it's required in both versions. However:
- Changing from positional to keyword arguments breaks callers
- The default `nil` value would cause runtime errors
- Without broader context about calling conventions or API evolution, this requires human evaluation

Since the semantic intent is ambiguous and the changes are syntactically incompatible, the conflict is preserved.
