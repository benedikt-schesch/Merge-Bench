The merge conflict involves changes to the `rollback` method and the addition of a new `close` method. The conflict markers indicate two different implementations:

1. **HEAD branch** (current branch):
   - Adds `@rolled_back = true` in the `rollback` method
   - Does not include a `close` method

2. **Incoming branch** (75c6c13...):
   - Adds `@failure = true` in the `rollback` method
   - Defines a new `close` method that calls `success` and `super`

### Resolution Analysis
- The changes in `rollback` are semantically distinct (`@rolled_back` vs `@failure`). These appear to be separate state-tracking mechanisms.
- The `close` method is entirely new functionality in the incoming branch.
- The extra `end` after the conflict markers creates ambiguity about structural integrity.

Given the ambiguity in:
1. Whether both state variables (`@rolled_back` and `@failure`) are needed
2. How the extra `end` after the conflict markers should be handled
3. Potential interactions between state variables

The conflict cannot be safely resolved automatically. Manual intervention is required to determine:
- If both state variables should coexist
- How to integrate the `close` method
- Structural correctness of the code

### Unresolved Output
```ruby
module ActiveGraph
  module Transaction
    def rollback
      super
<<<<<<< HEAD
      @rolled_back = true
=======
      @failure = true
    end

    def close
      success
      super
>>>>>>> 75c6c1343248bdc6d75ce59607b270ca6cfcda76
    end

    def after_commit(&block)
      after_commit_registry << block
    end
