The conflict arises from differences in quoting style for the Rails version string and whitespace formatting. Both versions intend to conditionally define `attr_accessible` for Rails versions below 4. The semantic intent is identical - only stylistic preferences differ. 

The resolution preserves the original context while choosing the double-quoted version for consistency with the surrounding codebase (as seen in the `TestModelSecurityModelWithFind` class). The extra blank line from the other branch is omitted to maintain existing formatting patterns.

```ruby
end

class TestModelSecurityModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  using_access_control
  if Rails.version < "4"
    attr_accessible :attr, :attr_2, :test_attrs
  end
end
class TestModelSecurityModelWithFind < ActiveRecord::Base
  if Rails.version < "3.2"

```
