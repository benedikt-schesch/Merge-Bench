The conflict involves a minor whitespace difference in the `xavier` method. Both versions implement the same logic, with the only difference being an extra blank line after the method definition in the branch commit. 

Since the surrounding context shows no extra blank lines in method definitions (like the `->` lambda above), I've resolved this by keeping the HEAD version's formatting for consistency. The semantic behavior remains unchanged.

Resolved code:
```ruby
        ->(_n, _i, _j) { rand * 2 - 1 }
      end

      # Xavier/Glorot initialization based on layer dimensions
      def xavier(structure)
        lambda do |layer, _i, _j|
          limit = Math.sqrt(6.0 / (structure[layer] + structure[layer + 1]))
          rand * 2 * limit - limit
        end
      end
