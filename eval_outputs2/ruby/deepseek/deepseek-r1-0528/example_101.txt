The conflict arises from differing styles in a Rails version check condition. Both sides intend to conditionally define `attr_accessible` for Rails versions below 4. The differences are:
1. HEAD uses double quotes (`"4"`), the other branch uses single quotes (`'4'`)
2. The other branch adds an extra blank line after the condition

Since the intent is identical and Ruby treats single/double quotes equivalently here, we preserve the HEAD version's quote style and remove the unnecessary blank line for consistency with surrounding code.

Resolved version:
```ruby
end
class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  has_many :branches
  belongs_to :country
  if Rails.version < "4"
    attr_accessible :name, :country, :country_id
  end
end
class SmallCompany < Company
  def self.decl_auth_context
```
