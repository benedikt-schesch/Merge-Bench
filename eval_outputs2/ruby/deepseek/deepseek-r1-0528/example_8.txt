```ruby
      # dont run cleanup more than once per minute
      return 0 unless Sidekiq.redis { |conn| conn.set("process_cleanup", "1", nx: true, ex: 60) }

      count = 0
      Sidekiq.redis do |conn|
        procs = conn.sscan_each("processes").to_a.sort
        heartbeats = conn.pipelined { |pipeline|
          procs.each do |key|
            pipeline.hget(key, "info")
          end
        }
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. The conflict is between `sscan` (HEAD) and `sscan_each` (branch) for Redis set scanning
2. `sscan_each` is the correct method for full set iteration (branch is semantically correct)
3. The `.sort` operation from HEAD should be preserved to maintain deterministic ordering
4. The combination achieves both:
   - Correct Redis iteration (branch fix)
   - Stable element ordering (HEAD requirement)
5. No ambiguity - both changes are compatible and address different concerns
