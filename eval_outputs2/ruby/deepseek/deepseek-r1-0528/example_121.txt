The conflict arises from differing approaches to testing timestamp proximity in RSpec. Both versions aim to verify that `task.updated_at` is approximately equal to the current time, but use different matchers with different tolerance levels:

1. HEAD version uses `be_close(Time.now, 5)` (5-second tolerance)
2. Other branch uses `be_within(1).of(Time.now)` (1-second tolerance)

Since the tolerance levels conflict (5 vs 1 seconds) and we don't have context about which precision is required, the conflict remains unresolved. The semantic intent is identical, but the implementation disagreement requires manual resolution.

Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```ruby
      conversation = Factory.create(:conversation, :simple => false, :created_at => 2.hours.ago, :updated_at => 1.hour.ago)

      task = conversation.convert_to_task!

      task.should_not be_nil
<<<<<<< HEAD
      task.updated_at.should be_close(Time.now, 5)
=======
      task.updated_at.should be_within(1).of(Time.now)
>>>>>>> c91f301d8e8bc0b83797bd94a82dd1c8b1838234
    end

    it "and when converted to a task, the comments should be transferred to the task" do
      conversation = Factory.build(:conversation, :simple => false)
      conversation.comments_attributes = {"0" => { :body => "Just sayin' hi" }}

```
