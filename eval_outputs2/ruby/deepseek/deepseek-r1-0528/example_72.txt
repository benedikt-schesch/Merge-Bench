The conflict arises from two independent additions: one adding `net/https` and the other adding `yajl/json_gem`. Both are legitimate dependencies that should be preserved. The resolution maintains all existing requirements while including both new dependencies in a logical order (keeping related HTTP libraries together).

Resolved snippet:
```ruby
require "digest/sha1"
require "net/http"
require "net/https"
require "yajl/json_gem"

require "private_pub/faye_extension"
require "private_pub/engine" if defined? Rails

module PrivatePub

```
