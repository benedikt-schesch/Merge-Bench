I'll help resolve this merge conflict while preserving the context and intent. The conflict is about how the method parameter is defined - one side uses a required positional argument while the other uses an optional keyword argument. 

Looking at the context:
1. The method requires a `target_url` parameter (as per the documentation)
2. The method body immediately uses `target_url` without checking for nil
3. The comment specifies this is an "API-generated URL", meaning it should always be provided

Here's the resolved version preserving the required parameter:

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of LastMonthInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of LastMonthInstance
                def get_page(target_url)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return LastMonthPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```

Resolution rationale:
- Kept the positional parameter `(target_url)` since:
  - The URL is required for the request to work
  - The method body doesn't handle nil values
  - Matches the documentation stating it's required
  - Preserves current behavior
- Removed the keyword parameter option to avoid potential nil errors
- Maintained all surrounding context and spacing exactly as provided
