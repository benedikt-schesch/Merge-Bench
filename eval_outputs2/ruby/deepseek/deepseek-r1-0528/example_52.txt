Based on the provided code snippet and the semantic intent of both branches, I've resolved the conflict by preserving the explicit blank line added in the other branch. The blank line doesn't change functionality but improves readability by separating the softmax handling from the else block. Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
            end
          end
          if @activation[n] == :softmax
            values = @propagation_functions[n].call(sums)
            values.each_index { |j| @activation_nodes[n + 1][j] = values[j] }

          else
            sums.each_index do |j|
              @activation_nodes[n + 1][j] = @propagation_functions[n].call(sums[j])
            end
          end
```

Key resolution points:
1. Both branches agree on core functionality (softmax vs other activation handling)
2. The other branch's explicit blank line (`\n`) is preserved for visual clarity
3. The HEAD version's spacing is maintained elsewhere
4. Semantics remain unchanged - blank lines don't affect Ruby execution
5. Readability is improved by visually separating the conditional blocks

The conflict was purely stylistic and the resolution maintains the original intent of both branches while incorporating a minor readability improvement.
