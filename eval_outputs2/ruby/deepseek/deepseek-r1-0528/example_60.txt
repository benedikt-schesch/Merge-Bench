Since the intent behind the conflicting changes is ambiguous without additional context (such as the implementations of `url` and `base_url` methods), the conflict cannot be safely resolved. Both versions modify the URL construction differently, and it's unclear which approach is correct or if they are compatible. Therefore, the original conflict is preserved.

```ruby
        JSON.parse(body)
      end

      def commit(action, parameters, options)
        begin
<<<<<<< HEAD
          raw_response = ssl_post(url(action), post_data(action, parameters), request_headers(options))
=======
          raw_response = ssl_post("#{base_url(action)}/#{action}", post_data(action, parameters), request_headers(options))
>>>>>>> 3de50b31248ab4d6532af3910b74001dcbdb7cc0
          response = parse(raw_response)
        rescue ResponseError => e
          raw_response = e.response.body
          response = parse(raw_response)
        end

```
