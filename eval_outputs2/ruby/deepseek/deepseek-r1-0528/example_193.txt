The conflict arises from differing method signatures for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument. Given the method's purpose of retrieving API results using a target URL, and the comment stating it requires a "API-generated URL", the required positional argument is more semantically appropriate. 

Here's the resolved snippet:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of NotificationInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of NotificationInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return NotificationPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```

Key resolution points:
1. Maintains the required `target_url` parameter as specified in the documentation
2. Avoids the optional keyword approach (`target_url: nil`) since the URL is mandatory
3. Preserves identical functionality in the method body
4. Maintains all original context and formatting

The resolution aligns with the method's intent to require a valid target URL for API requests.
