Based on the semantic analysis of the conflict, both changes are compatible when merged. The resolution preserves the required modules while maintaining consistent quoting style throughout the file:

```ruby
require "sinatra/base"
require "haml"
require "grit"
require "rdiscount"
require "rack-xslview"
require "rexml/document"
require "rack-docunext-content-length"

module GitWiki
  class << self
    attr_accessor :homepage, :extension, :repository
  end
```

Key resolution points:
1. Kept `rexml/document` requirement from HEAD (needed for XML processing)
2. Adopted double-quoted style from the other branch for consistency
3. Maintained all module requirements from both branches
4. Preserved the blank line above module definition as in original context

The resolved version ensures all required dependencies are included while maintaining consistent code style with the surrounding context.
