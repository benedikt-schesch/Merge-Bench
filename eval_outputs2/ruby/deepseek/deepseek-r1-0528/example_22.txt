The conflict arises from both branches adding a new file extension mapping in the same location. The resolution combines both additions while preserving the alphabetical order of extensions:

```ruby
               '.coffee'  => ['#'],               # CoffeeScript
               '.zsh'     => ['#'],               # Zsh
               '.clj'     => [';;'],              # Clojure
               '.sql'     => ['---', '//', '#' ], # SQL and PL types
               '.lua'     => ['--', '--[['],      # Lua
               '.md'      => ['<!--'],            # Markdown
               '.vim'     => ['"'],               # VimL
               '.html'    => ['<!--']             # HTML
             }

      loop do
        _mtch = filename.match(/(\.(\S+))$/)
```

Key resolution points:
1. Both `.md` (Markdown) and `.vim` (VimL) entries are valid additions
2. Maintains alphabetical order of extensions (`md` comes before `vim`)
3. Preserves exact syntax and spacing of both entries
4. Keeps surrounding context unchanged
5. Both comment styles are semantically correct for their respective file types

The conflict is non-ambiguous since both changes are independent additions to the hash table mapping file extensions to comment markers.
