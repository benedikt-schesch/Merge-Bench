            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of OutgoingCallerIdInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of OutgoingCallerIdInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return OutgoingCallerIdPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
The conflict centers around the method signature for `get_page`. Both versions agree the method takes a `target_url` parameter, but disagree on its format:
1. **HEAD version** uses a required positional argument (`target_url`)
2. **Other branch** uses an optional keyword argument (`target_url: nil`)

Analyzing semantics:
- The method requires `target_url` to function (it's passed directly to the HTTP request)
- The documentation explicitly states it's a required parameter ("API-generated URL")
- The keyword argument with `nil` default introduces risk of nil errors when called without arguments
- The method body shows no nil-checking or conditional logic for `target_url`

Since the method fundamentally requires this parameter to operate correctly, and there's no evidence of intentional API flexibility in the surrounding context, the positional argument (HEAD version) is semantically correct. The keyword approach would enable invalid states without compensating logic, making the HEAD implementation safer and more aligned with the documented intent.
