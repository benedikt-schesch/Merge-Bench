The merge conflict involves two incompatible changes to the method definition:
1. HEAD defines `hamming_distance` as an instance method without documentation
2. The incoming branch defines `self.hamming_distance` as a class method with YARD documentation

Since the method body doesn't use instance state (`a` and `b` are parameters), both implementations are technically valid. However, changing the method scope (instance vs class) is a semantic conflict that requires understanding of the broader context. The method could be intended for:
- Instance use (comparing attributes of the current object)
- Class-level utility (general vector comparison)

Without seeing the surrounding class/module structure or usage examples, we cannot safely determine which implementation is correct. The YARD documentation from the incoming branch is valuable, but we can't automatically reconcile the method scope.

Here's the unresolved snippet with conflict markers:

```ruby
      # The Hamming distance between two attributes vectors of equal 
      # length is the number of attributes for which the corresponding 
      # vectors are different
      # This distance function is frequently used with binary attributes,
      # though it can be used with other discrete attributes.
<<<<<<< HEAD
      def hamming_distance(a,b)
=======
      # @param a [Object]
      # @param b [Object]
      # @return [Object]
      def self.hamming_distance(a,b)
>>>>>>> 753f2ec0c999c414bbd1f295a5719f7687c78f13
        count = 0
        a.each_index do |i|
          count += 1 if a[i] != b[i]
        end
        return count

```

Resolution requires manual intervention:
1. If this should be an instance method: Keep HEAD's definition but add the YARD docs
2. If this should be a class method: Keep the incoming branch's implementation
3. If both are needed: Implement both versions with proper delegation
