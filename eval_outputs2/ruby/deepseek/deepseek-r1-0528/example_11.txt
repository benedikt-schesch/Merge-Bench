I've analyzed the merge conflict and resolved it by preserving the semantic intent of both changes. The key changes are:

1. The `sadd` command now uses an array `[key]` which is equivalent to a single element but aligns with Redis command expectations
2. The `exists?` method is used instead of `exists` to properly return a boolean value

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```ruby
        fails = procd = 0
        kb = memory_usage(::Process.pid)

        _, exists, _, _, msg = redis { |conn|
          conn.multi { |transaction|
            transaction.sadd("processes", [key])
            transaction.exists?(key)
            transaction.hmset(key, "info", to_json,
              "busy", curstate.size,
              "beat", Time.now.to_f,
              "rtt_us", rtt,
              "quiet", @done.to_s,
```
