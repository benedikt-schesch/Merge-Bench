```ruby
  belongs_to :branch
  belongs_to :company
  has_many :test_attr_throughs
  has_many :test_model_security_model_with_finds
  attr_reader :role_symbols

  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :test_model, :test_another_model, :attr, :branch, :company, :test_attr,
  	  :test_a_third_model, :n_way_join_item, :n_way_join_item_id, :test_attr_through_id, 
  	  :test_model_id, :test_another_model_id
  end
```

Resolution rationale:
1. The conflict only involves whitespace differences - specifically an empty line after `attr_reader :role_symbols`
2. Both versions agree on the core functionality (attribute reader + Rails version check)
3. Preserving the empty line improves readability without changing semantics
4. The context before/after remains unchanged per requirements
5. The resolution maintains compatibility with both branches' intentions

The change is purely cosmetic - adding a single newline between the attribute declaration and the Rails version check for better code organization. The logic remains identical to both conflicting versions.
