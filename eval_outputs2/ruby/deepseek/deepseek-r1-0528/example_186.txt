I've analyzed the merge conflict and determined that the intent of both sides is clear. The conflict arises from a parameter definition difference. The HEAD version uses a required positional parameter, while the branch version uses an optional keyword parameter. 

After considering the semantics:
1. The `target_url` parameter is required for the method to function correctly
2. The method body shows no handling of a `nil` target_url value
3. The documentation states it should be an "API-generated URL"
4. Making it optional with a default `nil` value would likely cause errors

Here's the resolved snippet preserving all context and spacing:

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of MediaInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of MediaInstance
              def get_page(target_url)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return MediaPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```

Resolution rationale:
- Kept the required positional parameter from HEAD
- Removed the keyword parameter syntax and default value from the branch
- Maintains the original method functionality while ensuring required parameters are enforced
- Avoids introducing potential nil-related errors from the branch version
