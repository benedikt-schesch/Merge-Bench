Based on the semantic context of ActiveRecord schema versioning, the version number should reflect the latest migration timestamp. Since `20100826150615` (HEAD) is chronologically later than `20100818185843`, it should be preserved as the authoritative version.

Resolved code:
```ruby
# all the migrations from scratch. The latter is a flawed and unsustainable approach (the more migrations
# you'll amass, the slower it'll run and the greater likelihood for issues).
#
# It's strongly recommended to check this file into your version control system.

ActiveRecord::Schema.define(:version => 20100826150615) do

  create_table "activities", :force => true do |t|
    t.integer  "user_id"
    t.integer  "project_id"
    t.integer  "target_id"
```

Resolution rationale:
1. Schema version must reflect the latest migration timestamp
2. `20100826150615` (2010-08-26 15:06:15) is newer than `20100818185843` (2010-08-18 18:58:43)
3. The table definition (`create_table "activities"`) is identical on both branches
4. No other conflicts exist in the provided snippet
