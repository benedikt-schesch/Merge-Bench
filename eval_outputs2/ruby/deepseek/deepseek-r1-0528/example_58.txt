The merge conflict arises from a duplicated comment line in the HEAD branch and a blank line added in the other branch. The duplicated comment appears to be accidental, while the blank line improves readability by separating the comment block from the method definition. The resolution keeps the comment concise while preserving the whitespace improvement.

Resolved code:
```ruby
      # 
      # Some considerations: 
      # * a and b must not include repeated items
      # * all attributes are treated equally

      def simple_matching_distance(a,b)
        similarity = 0.0
        a.each {|item| similarity += 2 if b.include?(item)}
        similarity /= (a.length + b.length)
        return 1.0/similarity - 1
```
