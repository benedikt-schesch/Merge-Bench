```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of IncomingPhoneNumberInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of IncomingPhoneNumberInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return IncomingPhoneNumberPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. The method body uses `target_url` directly without nil-checking, meaning it expects a non-nil value
2. The documentation explicitly states `target_url` is required ("API-generated URL")
3. Making the parameter optional (`target_url: nil`) would cause runtime errors when called without arguments since the HTTP request requires a valid URL
4. The HEAD version (positional argument) maintains compatibility with existing callers while ensuring required parameters are enforced
5. The keyword argument syntax in the other branch appears to be an unintentional breaking change since no corresponding changes exist in the method body to handle nil values

The resolved version maintains the original semantic intent while preserving runtime safety.
