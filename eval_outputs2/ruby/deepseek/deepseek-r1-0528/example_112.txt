I'll resolve this conflict by preserving the semantic intent of both changes while maintaining consistency with the surrounding code. Both branches are trying to conditionally define `attr_accessible` for Rails versions below 4. The differences are:
1. The other branch uses single quotes for the version string
2. The other branch adds extra whitespace above the condition

The resolution keeps the single quote style (which is common for simple strings in Ruby) while removing the extra whitespace to match the base branch's formatting.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```ruby
end
class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  has_many :branches
  belongs_to :country
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :name, :country, :country_id
  end
end
class SmallCompany < Company
  def self.decl_auth_context
```
