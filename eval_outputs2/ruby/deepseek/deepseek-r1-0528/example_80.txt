The conflict arises from both branches updating the version number independently. The HEAD branch (`0.3.15`) represents a stable patch update, while the feature branch (`0.4.0.beta2`) introduces a new minor version with beta status. Since merging feature branches typically prioritizes the newer functionality, the feature branch's version should be preserved to reflect the merged state accurately.

Resolved code:
```ruby
module Dandelion
  VERSION = '0.4.0.beta2'
end

```
