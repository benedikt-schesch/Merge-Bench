Based on the semantic analysis of both changes, the resolution incorporates the new `belongs_to :test_model` association from the merge branch while preserving the Rails version check from both branches. The `attr_accessible` list is updated to include all necessary attributes (`:name`, `:company`, and `:test_model`) since the new association requires mass assignment protection in Rails < 4.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```ruby
end

class Branch < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  belongs_to :company
  belongs_to :test_model

  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :name, :company, :test_model
  end
end
class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  has_many :branches
```

Key resolution points:
1. Added `belongs_to :test_model` association (from merge branch)
2. Combined `attr_accessible` parameters to include both existing attributes (`:name`, `:company`) and new attribute (`:test_model`)
3. Maintained Rails version check structure
4. Preserved all context and spacing exactly as provided outside conflict markers
5. The blank line between associations and version check is maintained for readability

This resolves the conflict by:
- Adding the new association required by the merge branch
- Ensuring all relevant attributes are protected in Rails < 4
- Maintaining compatibility with both branches' semantics
- Preserving surrounding context exactly as provided
