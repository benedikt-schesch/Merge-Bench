I'll resolve this conflict by preserving the TODO comment from the HEAD version while keeping the silenced code commented out as in both versions. The intent is to maintain the deprecation notes while keeping the silencing disabled.

```ruby
MissingSourceFile::REGEXPS.push([/^cannot load such file -- (.+)$/i, 1])

# Silence Rails 4 deprecation warnings in test suite
# TODO: Model.scoped is deprecated
# TODO: Eager loading Post.includes(:comments).where("comments.title = 'foo'") becomes Post.includes(:comments).where("comments.title = 'foo'").references(:comments)
# TODO: has_many conditions is deprecated for a scoped block
# if Rails.version >= '4'
#   ActiveSupport::Deprecation.silenced = true
# end

puts "Testing against rails #{Rails::VERSION::STRING}"

RAILS_ROOT = File.dirname(__FILE__)


```

Resolution reasoning:
1. Preserved the `has_many` TODO comment from HEAD since it's valuable context
2. Kept the silencing code commented out as in both versions
3. Maintained the block comment style from the other branch for consistency
4. The solution maintains the original intent of documenting deprecations while keeping silencing disabled
5. All surrounding context remains unchanged with original spacing preserved
