Based on the semantic analysis, the conflict arises from two compatible changes:
1. HEAD branch maintains the existing structure with Rails version check for `attr_accessible`
2. Other branch adds a new `belongs_to :test_model` association and includes it in `attr_accessible`

The resolution adds the new association while combining the `attr_accessible` attributes from both branches, maintaining the original HEAD's double-quote style for consistency.

```ruby
end

class Branch < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  belongs_to :company
  belongs_to :test_model

  if Rails.version < "4"
    attr_accessible :name, :company, :test_model
  end
end
class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  has_many :branches
```
