Based on the analysis, the conflict arises from different method signatures. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument with a default value. 

After examining the semantics:
1. The method requires `target_url` to function (it's passed directly to the request)
2. The method comment indicates it's a required parameter
3. The keyword argument version introduces a dangerous default (`nil`) that would cause runtime errors
4. The positional argument version maintains correctness and matches the method's usage

Resolution: Keep the HEAD version's method signature as it safely enforces the required parameter. The keyword argument version's nil default would break functionality if called without arguments.

Resolved code:
```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of AvailablePhoneNumberCountryInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of AvailablePhoneNumberCountryInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return AvailablePhoneNumberCountryPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
