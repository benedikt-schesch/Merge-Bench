```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of PayloadInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of PayloadInstance
                def get_page(target_url)
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return PayloadPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. **Parameter Requirement:** The method fundamentally requires `target_url` to function, as it's passed directly to the API request. Making it optional (`target_url: nil`) would cause runtime errors when called without this parameter.
2. **Method Semantics:** The documentation explicitly describes this as retrieving "a single page" using an "API-generated URL", confirming it's a required input.
3. **Interface Consistency:** The HEAD version maintains a clear interface contract where callers must provide the required URL. The alternative approach would introduce an optional parameter that cannot actually be omitted without breaking functionality.
4. **Safety:** Retaining the required positional argument prevents accidental nil values from propagating to the HTTP request layer.

The conflict is resolved by keeping the required positional parameter, as it correctly enforces the necessary input while matching the method's core functionality.
