The conflict arises from a method signature change. The HEAD version uses a positional argument, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument. However, the method body uses `target_url` without a nil check, implying it should be required. The HEAD version's positional argument ensures this requirement is enforced.

Resolved version:
```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of LocalInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of LocalInstance
              def get_page(target_url)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return LocalPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
