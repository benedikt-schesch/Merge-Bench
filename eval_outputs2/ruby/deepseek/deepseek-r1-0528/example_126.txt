Based on the semantic analysis of both changes, here's the resolved version. The conflict involves choosing between singular and plural resource routing for `controller_plural_name`. The context shows:

1. Subsequent routes (`login`/`logout`) represent singleton actions (user session)
2. `model_controller_plural_name` uses plural resources (standard CRUD)
3. Authentication routes typically use singular resources for session management

The resolution uses `route_resource` (singular) for session-related routes while preserving plural resources for the main model.

```ruby
        m.migration_template 'migration.rb', 'db/migrate', :assigns => {
          :migration_name => "Create#{class_name.pluralize.gsub(/::/, '')}"
        }, :migration_file_name => "create_#{file_path.gsub(/\//, '_').pluralize}"
      end
      unless options[:skip_routes]
        m.route_resource  controller_plural_name
        m.route_resources model_controller_plural_name
        m.route_name('signup', '/signup', {:controller => model_controller_plural_name, :action => 'new'})
        m.route_name('register', '/register', {:controller => model_controller_plural_name, :action => 'create'})
        m.route_name('login', '/login', {:controller => controller_plural_name, :action => 'new'})
        m.route_name('logout', '/logout', {:controller => controller_plural_name, :action => 'destroy'})
