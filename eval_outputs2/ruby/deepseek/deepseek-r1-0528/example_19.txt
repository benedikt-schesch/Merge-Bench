Here's the resolved snippet preserving context and intent:

```ruby
      module Trace
        class SpanTest < Minitest::Test
          Segment = Struct.new(:guid, :transaction)
          Transaction = Struct.new(:trace_id)

          def setup
            @tracer = NewRelic::Agent::OpenTelemetry::Trace::Tracer.new
          end

          def teardown
            NewRelic::Agent.instance.transaction_event_aggregator.reset!
            NewRelic::Agent.instance.span_event_aggregator.reset!
          end


```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Both branches agree on the `Segment`/`Transaction` structs and `teardown` method
2. The incoming branch (12a1760) adds a valid `setup` method that initializes `@tracer`
3. HEAD branch had no conflicting content (just whitespace), so the `setup` method can be safely added
4. The `setup` method is semantically compatible with the existing `teardown`
5. Ordering is preserved with setup before teardown per standard test conventions

The conflict is resolved by keeping the new `setup` method while maintaining all existing context.
