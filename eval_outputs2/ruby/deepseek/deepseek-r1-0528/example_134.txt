The merge conflict centers around the variable name used to store the association object. Both changes appear to serve the same semantic purpose (storing the association) but use different variable names (`@join_parts` vs `@joins`). 

Since the context doesn't clarify which variable is preferred in the current codebase and both changes seem functionally equivalent, this represents a true semantic conflict that requires human judgment. The resolution depends on which variable name is consistent with the rest of the application.

Here is the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```ruby
            association = PolymorphicJoinAssociation.new(reflection, self, klass, parent)
          else
            association = build_join_association(reflection, parent)
          end
          association.join_type = join_type
<<<<<<< HEAD
          @join_parts << association
=======
          @joins << association
>>>>>>> 5df8ae16e28501c35b5681da6563eba6bff0ffb6
          cache_joined_association(association)
        end
        association
      else
        build_without_metawhere(associations, parent, join_type)
```
