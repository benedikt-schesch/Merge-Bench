The merge conflict involves two different approaches to defining the `squared_euclidean_distance` method:

1. **HEAD Version** (top section):
   - Defines the method as an instance method (`def squared_euclidean_distance`)
   - Lacks YARD documentation tags

2. **Branch Version** (bottom section):
   - Defines the method as a module/class method (`def self.squared_euclidean_distance`)
   - Includes YARD documentation for parameters and return value

**Resolution Approach**:  
The conflict cannot be automatically resolved due to semantic differences in how the method is intended to be used:
- The choice between instance method vs module method depends on broader context (e.g., whether `Proximity` will be included in classes or used as a namespace)
- The YARD documentation in the branch version is valuable but conflicts with the method type change

**Recommendation**:  
A human developer must decide between:
1. Keeping the method as an instance method and adding documentation
2. Switching to a module method and keeping the documentation
3. Supporting both approaches (if applicable)

**Unresolved Output**:
```ruby
    # This module provides classical distance functions
    module Proximity
      
      # This is a faster computational replacement for eclidean distance.
      # Parameters a and b are vectors with continuous attributes.
