The conflict involves the method signature of `get_page`. The HEAD branch uses a required positional parameter (`target_url`), while the other branch uses an optional keyword parameter (`target_url: nil`). 

The method body requires `target_url` to function, as it passes it directly to the API request. Making it optional could lead to runtime errors if called without this parameter. The documentation also states this is an "API-generated URL" implying it should always be provided.

However, the change to a keyword parameter might be part of a larger refactoring effort (e.g., transitioning to keyword arguments) that isn't visible in this snippet. Since the intent behind the keyword argument change is ambiguous without additional context, the conflict remains unresolved.

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of DailyInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of DailyInstance
