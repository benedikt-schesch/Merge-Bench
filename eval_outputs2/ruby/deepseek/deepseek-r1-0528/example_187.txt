The conflict arises from a change in the method signature for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional parameter while the branch version changes it to an optional keyword parameter. Given the context:

1. The method body expects `target_url` to be provided (uses it unconditionally in the request)
2. The documentation states it's a required API-generated URL
3. Making it optional with `nil` default would risk runtime errors

The resolution maintains the required positional parameter since:
- It matches the method's usage in the body
- It satisfies the documented requirement
- The branch's optional approach introduces risk without handling logic

Resolved code:
```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of MemberInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of MemberInstance
              def get_page(target_url)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return MemberPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
