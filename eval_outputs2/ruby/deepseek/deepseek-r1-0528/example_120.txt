```ruby
      upload = Factory.create :upload
      comment = Factory.create :comment, :upload_ids => [upload.id.to_s],
        :body => "Can't touch this"
      Comment.update_all({:updated_at => 15.minutes.ago}, :id => comment.id)

      comment.reload.updated_at.should be_within(1).of(15.minutes.ago)
      upload.reload.destroy
      comment.reload.updated_at.should be_within(1).of(Time.now)
    end
  end
  
  context "hours" do
    it "assigns human hours" do
```

The resolution uses the incoming change (`be_within(1)`) because:
1. It's more precise (1 second tolerance vs 5 seconds)
2. `be_within` is the modern RSpec matcher
3. Both changes share identical test steps structure
4. The semantic intent (testing timestamp updates) is preserved

The conflict was straightforward since both versions were:
1. Setting up test data
2. Modifying timestamps
3. Destroying an upload
4. Asserting timestamp changes
The only difference was assertion syntax preference.
