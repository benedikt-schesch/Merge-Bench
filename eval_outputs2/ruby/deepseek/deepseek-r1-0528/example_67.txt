I've analyzed the merge conflict and found that the intent of both branches is ambiguous. The HEAD branch introduces logic to check a user path and compute timestamps, but doesn't provide a return value or method closure. The other branch simply returns a constant and properly closes the method. Since it's unclear how these should be combined or which should take precedence, I'm returning the original conflicted snippet:

```ruby
      #
      # @return [String]
      #   The path to the database directory.
      #
      def self.path
<<<<<<< HEAD
        if File.directory?(USER_PATH)
          t1 = Dir.chdir(USER_PATH) { Time.parse(`git log --date=iso8601 --pretty="%cd" -1`).utc }
          t2 = VENDORED_TIMESTAMP
=======
        DEFAULT_PATH
      end

      #
      # Tests whether the database exists.
      #
      # @param [String] path
```
