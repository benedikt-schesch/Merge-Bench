The conflict arises from different quote styles and whitespace usage in the conditional statement. Both versions implement identical functionality to conditionally declare `attr_accessible` for Rails versions below 4. The HEAD version uses double quotes and has no extra newline, while the other branch uses single quotes and adds a blank line. 

The resolution preserves the HEAD version's style for consistency with the adjacent class (`TestModelSecurityModelWithFind`) which uses double quotes in its version check. The blank line from the other branch is removed to maintain consistent spacing with the surrounding context.

```ruby
end

class TestModelSecurityModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  using_access_control
  if Rails.version < "4"
    attr_accessible :attr, :attr_2, :test_attrs
  end
end
class TestModelSecurityModelWithFind < ActiveRecord::Base
  if Rails.version < "3.2"
```
