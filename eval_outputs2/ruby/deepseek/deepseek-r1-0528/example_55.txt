The conflict was a trivial whitespace difference. Both versions intended to implement the Manhattan distance calculation. The only difference was an extra blank line after the method definition in the incoming branch. Since this doesn't affect functionality and improves readability, I kept the blank line while preserving the surrounding context.

Resolved code:
```ruby
      
      
      # city block, Manhattan distance, or L1 norm.
      # Parameters a and b are vectors with continuous attributes.
      def manhattan_distance(a, b)

        sum = 0.0
        a.each_with_index do |item_a, i|
          item_b = b[i]
          sum += (item_a - item_b).abs
        end

```
