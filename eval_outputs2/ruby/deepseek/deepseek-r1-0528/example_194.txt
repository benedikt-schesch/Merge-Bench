The merge conflict centers around the method signature for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument `target_url`, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument with a default `nil` value. 

The method body uses `target_url` without nil-checking, which could lead to errors if called without an argument in the keyword version. The comment indicates `target_url` is a required API-generated URL. 

Since both branches agree on the requirement of `target_url` but disagree on argument passing semantics, and the surrounding context doesn't resolve this ambiguity, the conflict remains unresolved.

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of OriginationUrlInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of OriginationUrlInstance
