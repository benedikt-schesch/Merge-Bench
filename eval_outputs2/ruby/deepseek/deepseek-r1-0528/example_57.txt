I've analyzed the merge conflict and determined the intent. Both sides are contributing to the documentation of the `hamming_distance` method, but there's a formatting difference in the spacing after the comment block. 

The resolution keeps the documentation comment intact while maintaining the blank line for better readability between the comment and method definition, which is a common Ruby convention.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
      # The Hamming distance between two attributes vectors of equal 
      # length is the number of attributes for which the corresponding 
      # vectors are different
      # This distance function is frequently used with binary attributes,
      # though it can be used with other discrete attributes.

      def hamming_distance(a,b)
        count = 0
        a.each_index do |i|
          count += 1 if a[i] != b[i]
        end
```

Key resolution points:
1. Removed merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
2. Kept the documentation comments from both sides (identical content)
3. Preserved the blank line after the comment block for readability
4. Maintained all existing spacing and indentation
5. Kept the method implementation unchanged

The blank line doesn't affect functionality but improves code readability by visually separating the documentation from the method implementation.
