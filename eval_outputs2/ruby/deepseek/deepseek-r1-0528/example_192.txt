**Resolution Explanation:**  
The conflict remains unresolved due to semantic ambiguity. The key differences are:

1. **HEAD version** uses a required positional argument `(target_url)`
2. **Other branch** uses an optional keyword argument `(target_url: nil)`

The intent behind these changes is unclear without broader context:
- Was the keyword argument added for flexibility/readability?
- Does the calling code expect different invocation patterns?
- Is there validation logic elsewhere that depends on argument type?

Since both versions fundamentally require a target URL to function (as evidenced by the `request('GET', target_url)` call), but the argument handling semantics are incompatible, this conflict requires human decision based on:
1. How the method is called throughout the codebase
2. Project-wide argument passing conventions
3. Whether `nil` should be allowed as a valid input

Possible resolutions would require choosing one approach and updating all call sites accordingly, but this cannot be safely determined from the given snippet.
