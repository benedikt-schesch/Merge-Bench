Based on the provided context, I cannot determine with certainty whether the two additional require statements from the HEAD branch should be preserved or if the other branch's removal was intentional. Both changes seem semantically valid:

1. The HEAD branch adds explicit requires for specific result classes (InsecureSource and UnpatchedGem), which might be necessary for new functionality
2. The other branch removes these requires, potentially due to refactoring where these are now required elsewhere

Since the intent is ambiguous and I don't have broader context about the codebase structure or refactoring efforts, I'm returning the original conflicted snippet:
