I've analyzed the merge conflict in the provided code snippet. The conflict arises between two different method signatures for `get_page`:

1. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument: `def get_page(target_url)`
2. The other branch uses an optional keyword argument: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

After considering the semantics and intent:
- The method requires a `target_url` parameter to function correctly (as shown by its direct usage in the API request)
- The method body provides no nil-checking or default behavior, indicating `target_url` is mandatory
- The documentation states this is a required parameter ("API-generated URL for the requested results page")
- Changing from required positional to optional keyword argument would break callers expecting the original interface
- The optional nil default in the branch version could introduce errors when called without arguments

Since the two changes are semantically incompatible and represent different calling conventions, and without more context about the broader codebase changes, I'm unable to safely resolve this conflict.

Here's the original code with conflict markers preserved:

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of CommandInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of CommandInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD
          def get_page(target_url)
=======
          def get_page(target_url: nil)
>>>>>>> d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return CommandPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
