The conflict arises from differing base classes for `EventNameLocked`. Both sides intend to define this error class, but one uses `StandardError` while the other uses `Error`. 

Observing the surrounding context:
1. All other classes inherit from `Error` (e.g., `MissingOrInvalidImageFile`, `UserRegistrationFailed`)
2. `Error` appears to be a consistent base class throughout this snippet
3. `StandardError` breaks this pattern

The semantic intent is to maintain consistency with the existing error hierarchy. Both branches agree on the class name (`EventNameLocked`) and placement in the code. The version using `Error` aligns with the surrounding context.

Resolved code:
```ruby
    class MissingOrInvalidImageFile < Error; end
    class TooManyUnapprovedPhotosPending < Error; end
    class ExtendedPermissionRequired < Error; end
    class ReadMailboxExtendedPermissionRequired < Error; end
    class InvalidFriendList < Error; end
    class EventNameLocked < Error; end
    class UserUnRegistrationFailed < Error
      attr_accessor :failed_users
    end
    class UserRegistrationFailed < Error
      attr_accessor :failed_users

```

Key resolution points:
1. Kept `Error` base class for consistency
2. Removed unnecessary space before semicolon to match surrounding style
3. Preserved all surrounding context exactly as provided
4. Maintained incomplete method ending (original snippet ends mid-implementation)

The resolution maintains semantic consistency while honoring the existing error class pattern. No ambiguity exists since all surrounding errors use `Error` inheritance.
