The conflict arises from a minor formatting difference in a Rails version check for `attr_accessible`. Both versions functionally achieve the same goal of conditionally enabling mass assignment protection in Rails versions below 4. The only differences are:
1. Single vs double quotes around the version string
2. Presence of a blank line before the condition

Since both styles are functionally identical in Ruby and the blank line doesn't affect behavior, the branch version is preferred as it provides slightly better readability with the separation. The resolved version maintains the branch's formatting choice.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```ruby
  end
  has_many :test_attrs
  belongs_to :test_attr
  using_access_control :include_read => true, 
    :context => :test_model_security_models
  
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :test_attr, :attr
  end
end

class Branch < ActiveRecord::Base

```
