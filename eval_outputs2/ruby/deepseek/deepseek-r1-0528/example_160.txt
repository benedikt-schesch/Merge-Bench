The conflict arises from a difference in the method signature for `get_page`. The HEAD branch uses a required positional argument, while the other branch uses a keyword argument with a default value of `nil`. 

After analyzing:
1. The method requires `target_url` to function (it's passed directly to the request)
2. The comment states it's an "API-generated URL" (required parameter)
3. The keyword argument with `nil` default introduces risk of nil errors
4. Both versions are semantically valid but incompatible
5. Without broader context of calling patterns, intent is ambiguous

I'm returning the unresolved conflict since the risk of breaking existing calls is high:

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of CredentialInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of CredentialInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD
          def get_page(target_url)
=======
          def get_page(target_url: nil)
>>>>>>> d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return CredentialPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
