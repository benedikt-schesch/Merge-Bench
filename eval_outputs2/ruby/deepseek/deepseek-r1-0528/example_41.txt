Since the intent behind the method being an instance method (HEAD version) versus a class method with documentation (incoming branch) is ambiguous without broader context, the conflict cannot be automatically resolved. The method body remains identical in both versions, but the declaration and documentation differ significantly.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```ruby
      # 
      # Some considerations: 
      # * a and b must not include repeated items
      # * all attributes are treated equally
      # * all attributes are treated equally
<<<<<<< HEAD
      def simple_matching_distance(a,b)
=======
      # @param a [Object]
      # @param b [Object]
      # @return [Object]
      def self.simple_matching_distance(a,b)
>>>>>>> 753f2ec0c999c414bbd1f295a5719f7687c78f13
        similarity = 0.0
        a.each {|item| similarity += 2 if b.include?(item)}
        similarity /= (a.length + b.length)
        return 1.0/similarity - 1
      end

```
