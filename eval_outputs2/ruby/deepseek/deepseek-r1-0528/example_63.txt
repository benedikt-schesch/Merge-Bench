```ruby

              if am_master
                handle_delayed_items
                update_schedule if dynamic
              end

              was_master = am_master
            rescue *INTERMITTENT_ERRORS => e
              log! e.message
              release_master_lock
            end
            poll_sleep
          end

```

**Explanation of Resolution:**
1. **Preserved Intent of Both Branches:**
   - The `was_master = am_master` assignment from the feature branch is retained to capture master status before potential errors
   - The `*INTERMITTENT_ERRORS` constant from HEAD is maintained for error handling consistency
   - The blank line before `was_master` is kept for readability

2. **Semantic Reasoning:**
   - The assignment needs to happen *before* rescue blocks but *after* master operations
   - The error constant likely includes `Errno::EAGAIN`, `Errno::ECONNRESET` and `Redis::CannotConnectError`
   - This maintains existing error handling behavior while adding the new state variable

3. **Conflict-Free Result:**
   - Sequential execution: master operations → state capture → error handling
   - All functionality from both branches is preserved
   - No ambiguous behavior introduced

The resolution maintains both branches' functionality while ensuring proper execution order and error handling semantics.
