The conflict arises from a difference in method signature: one uses a positional argument while the other uses a keyword argument with a default value. However, the method body requires `target_url` to be provided (it's used directly in the request), and the documentation explicitly states it's a required parameter. 

The keyword argument approach with `nil` default introduces potential nil errors since there's no nil-check in the method body. The positional argument enforces the required parameter more strictly. Since both versions semantically require a URL and the method logic is identical, the positional argument is safer and maintains the intended contract.
