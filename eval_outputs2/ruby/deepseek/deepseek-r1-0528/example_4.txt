The conflict arises from different approaches to simulating the absence of `fb_sig` in a test. The test name `test_skips_with_true_condition_without_fb_sig` indicates the key requirement is the **absence of the `fb_sig` parameter**, not just a nil value. 

The other branch's approach (using `fb_sig_user: 'ignored'`) better satisfies this requirement because:
1. It completely omits `fb_sig` (aligning with "without_fb_sig")
2. The `fb_sig_user` parameter is irrelevant to this test case since the middleware condition is hardcoded to `true`
3. The test only cares about the response status when `fb_sig` is missing

Here's the resolved snippet:

```ruby
    assert_equal 200, response.status
  end
  
  def test_skips_with_true_condition_without_fb_sig
    @facebook = Rack::Facebook.new(@app) { true }
    response = @page.call(:fb_sig_user => 'ignored')
    assert_equal 200, response.status
  end
  
  def test_verifies_with_true_condition_with_fb_sig
    @facebook = Rack::Facebook.new(@app) { true }
```
