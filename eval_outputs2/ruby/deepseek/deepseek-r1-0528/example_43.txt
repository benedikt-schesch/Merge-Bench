I've analyzed the merge conflict and resolved it by selecting the version that adds documentation and defines the method as a class method. This approach preserves both the functionality and improves documentation. Here's the resolved snippet:

```ruby
module Ai4r
  module NeuralNetwork
    # Collection of common weight initialization strategies.
    module WeightInitializations
      # Uniform distribution in [-1, 1)
      # @return [Object]
      def self.uniform
        ->(_n, _i, _j) { rand * 2 - 1 }
      end

      # Xavier/Glorot initialization based on layer dimensions
