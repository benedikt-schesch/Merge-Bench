I've analyzed the merge conflict and determined that the intent is ambiguous without additional context. Both sides are making changes to the same location - one adds a `name_status` method while the other removes it. Since I can't determine which change should take precedence or if both are needed, I'm returning the original conflict as requested.

Here's the preserved snippet with the conflict markers intact:

```ruby
      @full_diff = nil
      @full_diff_files = nil
      @stats = nil
    end
    attr_reader :from, :to
<<<<<<< HEAD
   
    def name_status
      cache_name_status
    end

    def path(path)
      @path = path
      return self
    end
```
