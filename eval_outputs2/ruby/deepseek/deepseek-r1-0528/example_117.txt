I've analyzed the merge conflict and resolved it by selecting the version that uses the simpler require statements. This approach aligns with standard Ruby practices where libraries are required by name once they're in the load path, rather than using relative file paths.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
require 'acts_as_follower'
require 'acts_as_followable'
require 'follow'

ActiveRecord::Base.send(:include, ActiveRecord::Acts::Follower)
ActiveRecord::Base.send(:include, ActiveRecord::Acts::Followable)
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. The conflict involves two different ways to require the same files
2. The `require 'filename'` version (from the `dfa3ea` branch) is:
   - More standard Ruby practice
   - Simpler and more maintainable
   - Works when the library is properly in Ruby's load path
3. The relative path version (from `HEAD`) is:
   - More brittle (depends on file location)
   - Less readable
   - Typically only needed for development setups
4. Both versions achieve the same semantic goal of loading the required libraries
5. The post-conflict ActiveRecord includes remain unchanged as they're identical in both branches

The chosen approach maintains functionality while improving code quality and adherence to Ruby conventions.
