The conflict involves requiring different TinyMCE-related files. After analyzing both sides:

1. **HEAD branch** requires a consolidated file (`tinymce/rails`)
2. **Other branch** requires individual component files

The conflict cannot be automatically resolved because:
- The intent differs significantly (consolidated vs modular requires)
- It's unclear if `tinymce/rails` already includes the other components
- There's risk of duplicate loading or missing dependencies

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```ruby
<<<<<<< HEAD
require "tinymce/rails"
=======
require "tinymce/version"
require "tinymce/railtie"
require "tinymce/configuration"
require "tinymce/tinymce_helper"
>>>>>>> 73335b54fae6c17953039b0961b4f1eb1151ad64

```

Resolution requires manual intervention:
1. Check if `tinymce/rails` loads the individual components
2. Verify if any specific components were added intentionally
3. Decide between consolidated vs explicit loading based on project needs
