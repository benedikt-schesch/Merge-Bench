Based on the semantic analysis, I've resolved the conflict by preserving the additional parameter (`auth_type`) from the HEAD branch while keeping the common parameters (`display` and `scope`) from both branches. This maintains the intended functionality from both sides of the merge.

```ruby
      #
      # /auth/facebook?display=popup
      #
      def authorize_params
        super.tap do |params|
          %w[display scope auth_type].each do |v|
            if request.params[v]
              params[v.to_sym] = request.params[v]
            end
          end


```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. Both branches agree on including `display` and `scope` parameters
2. The HEAD branch adds `auth_type` which appears to be a valid Facebook OAuth parameter
3. The additional parameter doesn't conflict with the other branch's functionality
4. The loop structure remains consistent with both implementations
5. The solution maintains backward compatibility while adding new functionality

The resolved code safely includes all three parameters since the loop conditionally adds them only if present in the request.
