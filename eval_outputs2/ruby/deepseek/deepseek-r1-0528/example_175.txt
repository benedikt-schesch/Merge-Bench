The conflict arises from differing method signatures: one uses a required positional argument, while the other uses an optional keyword argument. Since the method body requires `target_url` to be provided (as it's passed directly to the request), and there's no handling for a `nil` case, the intent is ambiguous. 

The change to a keyword argument might be part of a broader refactoring effort, but without additional context about callers or whether `target_url` should be optional, it's unclear which approach to favor. Both versions could be valid depending on external factors not visible in this snippet.

Here's the unresolved conflict preserved exactly as provided:

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of InstalledAddOnInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of InstalledAddOnInstance

            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return InstalledAddOnPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
