Based on analyzing the semantic intent of both sides of the merge conflict:

1. The HEAD version adds an `installers` method that accesses the current queue
2. The other branch removes this method
3. However, the `install` method below clearly depends on `installers` (using `installers << i`)
4. Removing the method would break functionality in `install`
5. Therefore, the method definition must be kept to maintain working functionality

Resolved code snippet:
```ruby
        @install_queues.push []
        yield
        @install_queues.pop
      end

      def installers
        @install_queues.last
      end

    protected

      def install(i)
        installers << i
        i
```
