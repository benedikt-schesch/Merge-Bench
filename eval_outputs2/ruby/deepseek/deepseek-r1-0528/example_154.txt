The conflict involves the method signature for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument `(target_url)`, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument `(target_url: nil)`. The method body requires `target_url` to function correctly (as it's passed to the request), making both versions semantically valid but syntactically incompatible.

Since the method's usage context isn't provided and both signatures could be intentional (positional for strictness vs. keyword for flexibility), the conflict is ambiguous. The resolution requires knowing:
1. How the method is called elsewhere
2. Project-wide argument conventions
3. Whether `nil` is a valid/expected state

Without this information, the conflict remains unresolved.

            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of ChannelInstance
