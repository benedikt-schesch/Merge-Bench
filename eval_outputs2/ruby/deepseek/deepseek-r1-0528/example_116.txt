I'll help resolve this merge conflict while preserving the context exactly as provided. Based on analyzing the intent of both changes:

1. For the first conflict in the 'marks color as unavailable' test:
   - Both sides are trying to verify that color is unavailable
   - The difference is in the RSpec matcher style: `be false` vs `be_falsey`
   - `be_falsey` is more robust as it covers both `false` and `nil` values
   - The right side's version (`be_falsey`) is preferable as it's a common RSpec convention

2. For the second conflict in the 'marks color as available' test:
   - Only the left side (HEAD) is shown in the snippet
   - Since we don't have the right side's version, we must preserve the conflict

Here's the resolved snippet with full context preserved:

```ruby
>>>>>>> 88e81a1828af3c87c3b3ef7563bc67326d6774d9
    end

    it 'marks color as unavailable' do
      STDOUT.stub(:tty?).and_return(false)
      Term.color?.should be_falsey
    end

    it 'marks color as available' do
      STDOUT.stub(:tty?).and_return(true)
<<<<<<< HEAD
