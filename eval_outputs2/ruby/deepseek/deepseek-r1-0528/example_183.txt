I've analyzed the merge conflict in the method signature for `get_page`. The key difference is that HEAD uses a required positional argument while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument. However, the method body requires a non-nil target_url for the request. Since the keyword version would allow nil values that would break the request, and the positional argument enforces the required parameter, I've resolved it using the HEAD version.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of KeyInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of KeyInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return KeyPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```

Reasoning:
1. The method requires target_url to function (it's used in the GET request)
2. The positional argument enforces this requirement at call time
3. The keyword argument with default nil would allow potentially broken calls
4. The surrounding context doesn't show any usage that would require keyword arguments
5. Both versions are semantically compatible with the method body
6. The positional argument maintains the current contract with callers
