```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of AddressInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of AddressInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return AddressPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```

**Reasoning:**  
The conflict arises between a required positional argument (`target_url`) and an optional keyword argument (`target_url: nil`). Considering:

1. The parameter is described as required in the documentation ("API-generated URL for the requested results page")
2. The method body passes `target_url` directly to the request without nil-checking
3. Keyword arguments weren't used elsewhere in the provided context

The positional argument approach is semantically safer since it:
- Enforces the required nature of the parameter
- Avoids potential nil errors in the request call
- Matches typical patterns for mandatory API parameters

The conflict is resolved by keeping the HEAD version while preserving all surrounding context and spacing.
