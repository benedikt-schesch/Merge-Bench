```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of CountryInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of CountryInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return CountryPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```

**Reasoning:**  
The conflict centers around the method signature for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument (`target_url`), while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument (`target_url: nil`). 

Considering:
1. The parameter is described as required in the documentation ("API-generated URL for the requested results page")
2. The method body passes `target_url` directly to the request without nil-checking
3. Using `nil` would cause a runtime error when making the HTTP request

The HEAD version's required positional argument better enforces the intended usage and prevents nil-related errors. The keyword argument approach in the other branch introduces risk without clear benefit in this context, as the parameter is mandatory.

The resolved version maintains the required positional argument while preserving all surrounding context and functionality.
