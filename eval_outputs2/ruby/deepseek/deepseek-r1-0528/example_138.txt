The merge conflict involves requiring different files from the `smarter_csv` library. Both branches agree on requiring `smarter_csv/writer`, but differ on other dependencies:

1. **HEAD branch** requires:
   - `parser` (likely core parsing logic)
   - `reader` (file reading functionality)

2. **Other branch** requires:
   - `parse` (likely an alternative/core parsing module)
   - `smarter_csv` (main entry point)

Since these appear to be distinct components with no clear indication of deprecation/replacement, and both sets of dependencies seem semantically important for different aspects of functionality, I'm unable to safely resolve this conflict automatically. The conflict requires human judgment to determine whether:
- These are complementary components that should all be required
- One branch's dependencies supersede the other's
- There's overlap between `parser`/`parse` or `reader`/`smarter_csv`

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:
