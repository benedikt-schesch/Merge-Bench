I've analyzed the merge conflict in the provided Ruby code snippet. The conflict arises from differing method signatures for `get_page`:

1. **HEAD version**: `def get_page(target_url)` - uses a required positional argument
2. **Incoming branch**: `def get_page(target_url: nil)` - uses an optional keyword argument with default nil

The method body uses `target_url` directly in the request without nil-checking, meaning it expects a non-nil value. The incoming branch's change to make the parameter optional introduces potential errors since the request would fail with a nil URL.

Without additional context showing why the keyword argument was introduced (like caller modifications or nil-handling logic), and considering the existing implementation requires a valid URL, I can't safely resolve this conflict. The intent behind the keyword argument change is unclear and potentially dangerous without corresponding method body adjustments.

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of IpAddressInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of IpAddressInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD
                def get_page(target_url)
=======
                def get_page(target_url: nil)
>>>>>>> d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0
                  response = @version.domain.request(
                      'GET',
                      target_url
                  )
                  return IpAddressPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
