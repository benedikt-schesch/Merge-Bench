The conflict involves defining the `cosine_distance` method. The HEAD version defines it as an instance method, while the other branch defines it as a class method with added documentation. Since the method implementation doesn't use any instance-specific state (it only operates on parameters), both approaches are semantically valid but represent different design choices. Without broader context about how this method is intended to be used in the class/module, it's impossible to determine which design is appropriate. The added documentation is valuable but can't be merged unilaterally due to the fundamental design conflict.

Here's the preserved snippet with the conflict:

```ruby
      # angle between them (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).
      # 
      # Parameters a and b are vectors with continuous attributes.
      #
      # D = sum(a[i] * b[i]) / sqrt(sum(a[i]**2)) * sqrt(sum(b[i]**2))
<<<<<<< HEAD
      def cosine_distance(a,b)
=======
      # @param a [Object]
      # @param b [Object]
      # @return [Object]
      def self.cosine_distance(a,b)
