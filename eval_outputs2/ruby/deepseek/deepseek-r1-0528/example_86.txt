The merge conflict involves differing method names and parameter structures for drawing a cropped image. The `HEAD` branch uses a method name `draw_image_cropped` with aggregated parameters (`position`, `crop_position`, `crop_size`), while the other branch uses `image_cropped` with discrete coordinates (`x`, `y`, `crop_x`, `crop_y`, `crop_width`, `crop_height`). The documentation after the conflict also diverges—only covering partial parameters—making it impossible to reconcile without knowing the underlying implementation's requirements.

Since the intent is ambiguous and the parameter structures are incompatible, the conflict remains unresolved. Here's the original snippet:

```ruby
  # @return [nil]
  # @example Draw a duck within a game
  #   display.image(Image['images/duck.png'], 80, 80)
  # Draw an image at a position.

<<<<<<< HEAD
  # @!method draw_image_cropped(image, position, crop_position, crop_size)
=======
  # @!method image_cropped(image, x, y, crop_x, crop_y, crop_width, crop_height)
>>>>>>> 878b5f40c7cfe9cb7ea3d8a910f468380bf14e70
  # @param [Image] image to draw
  # @param [Numeric] x position
  # @param [Numeric] y position
  # @param [Numeric] x position of crop
  # @param [Numeric] y position of crop
