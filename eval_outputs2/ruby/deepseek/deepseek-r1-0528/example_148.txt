I notice a merge conflict in the method signature for `get_page`. Both sides intend to define a method that retrieves a page of records using a target URL, but they disagree on the parameter format:

1. **HEAD version** uses a required positional parameter: `def get_page(target_url)`
2. **Other branch** uses an optional keyword parameter with default nil: `def get_page(target_url: nil)`

The method body uses `target_url` directly without checking for nil, suggesting it's expected to always have a value. This makes the keyword argument with default nil potentially dangerous since it could be called without any URL.

However, without seeing the call sites or broader context of why the keyword argument was introduced, I can't determine which approach aligns with the codebase's conventions. The intent is ambiguous since:
- The positional version ensures the parameter is always provided
- The keyword version might be part of a larger refactor to keyword arguments

Since I can't verify the calling context or design intentions, I'm returning the unresolved conflict:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of AuthorizedConnectAppInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of AuthorizedConnectAppInstance

              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return AuthorizedConnectAppPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
