The conflict arises from two different syntax styles for defining the hash options. Both versions are semantically equivalent but use different Ruby syntax:
1. HEAD uses the older hash rocket style (`:key => value`)
2. The other branch uses modern JSON-style syntax (`key: value`)

Since both versions achieve identical functionality and the JSON-style is more modern/idiomatic in current Ruby, I've resolved the conflict using that syntax. The trailing comma was removed from the last line as it's unnecessary and could cause issues in some Ruby versions.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby

      protected
      
      def s3connect!
        options = {
          access_key_id: @access_key_id,
          secret_access_key: @secret_access_key,
          use_ssl: true
        }

        options[:server] = @host if @host
        AWS::S3::Base.establish_connection!(options) unless AWS::S3::Base.connected?
      end

```
