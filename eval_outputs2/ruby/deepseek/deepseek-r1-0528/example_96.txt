The conflict arises from differing approaches to merging `img_opts` with default values. Both versions aim to set default attributes for the avatar image while allowing caller-provided options to override them. The key differences are:

1. **HEAD version** uses the standard pattern of creating a new hash with defaults, then merging user options (user options override defaults)
2. **Other branch** attempts to merge defaults into user options twice, which is redundant and potentially incorrect

The resolution keeps the HEAD version since:
- It's the standard approach for default option handling
- The other branch's double-merge is unnecessary
- Both versions produce identical results when called correctly
- The space inside the hash argument is preserved for consistency

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
module ProfilesHelper
  include Avatar::View::ActionViewSupport
  
  def icon profile, size = :small, img_opts = {}
    return "" if profile.nil?
    img_opts = {:title => profile.full_name, :alt => profile.full_name, :class => size}.merge(img_opts)
    link_to(avatar_tag(profile, {:size => size, :file_column_version => size }, img_opts))
  end
  
  def location_link profile = @p
    return profile.location if profile.location == Profile::NOWHERE
    link_to h(profile.location), search_profiles_path.add_param('search[location]' => profile.location)
```
