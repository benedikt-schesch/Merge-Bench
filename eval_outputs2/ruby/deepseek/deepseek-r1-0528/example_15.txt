The conflict arises from two different test method names and the presence of a skip statement in one branch. After analyzing the semantics:

1. The method `test_worker_uses_one_conn` in HEAD is marked as broken (with a skip)
2. The method `test_worker_reuses_conn` in the other branch appears to be its fixed/replacement version
3. Both methods share identical implementation code after the definition

The resolution keeps the fixed version (`test_worker_reuses_conn`) without the skip statement since:
- The HEAD version explicitly states it's broken
- The other branch provides a working alternative
- The method names suggest similar intent (connection handling)
- The identical implementation implies this is a replacement

Here's the resolved snippet preserving all context:

```ruby
    p_queue.enqueue("TestObject.two_args", "1", 2)
    p_queue.conn_adapter.disconnect
    t.join
  end

  def test_worker_reuses_conn
    QC.enqueue("TestObject.no_args")
    count = QC.default_conn_adapter.execute("SELECT count(*) from pg_stat_activity where datname = current_database()")["count"].to_i;
    worker = TestWorker.new
    worker.work
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
