The conflict arises from differing calling conventions for `@page.call`. One side uses no arguments (`@page.call`), while the other passes an empty hash (`@page.call({})`). 

After analyzing the surrounding context:
1. The test above the conflict uses `@page.call` without arguments
2. The test below the conflict isn't shown making a call
3. Rack applications typically expect an environment hash argument
4. The tests appear to be validating status codes, not request parameters

Since both calling conventions could work and there's no clear semantic difference in this test context, **the conflict is preserved** due to ambiguity. The resolution requires understanding how `@page` is implemented elsewhere.

```ruby
    assert_equal 400, response.status
