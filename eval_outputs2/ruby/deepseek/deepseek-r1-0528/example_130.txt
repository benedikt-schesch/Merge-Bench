The merge conflict involves two different approaches to testing for error messages in a Cucumber step. The HEAD version uses RSpec's `should` syntax while the other branch uses Test::Unit's `assert_match`. Since the testing framework preference is ambiguous and there's no clear semantic compatibility, I'm returning the unresolved conflict:

```ruby
# General

Then /^I should see error messages$/ do
<<<<<<< HEAD
  response.should contain(/error(s)? prohibited/)
=======
  assert_match /error(s)? prohibited/m, response.body
>>>>>>> b947402fd2dfbcb9f0a48dcd093a4ebf48653dfb
end

# Database

Given /^no user exists with an email of "(.*)"$/ do |email|

```
