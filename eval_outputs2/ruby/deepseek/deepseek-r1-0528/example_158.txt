The conflict arises from different method signatures for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument. Given that the method body directly uses `target_url` without nil-checking and the parameter is described as "API-generated URL" (implying it should always be provided), the required positional argument is safer to prevent accidental nil values.

Resolved code:
```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of AddOnResultInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of AddOnResultInstance
              def get_page(target_url)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return AddOnResultPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
