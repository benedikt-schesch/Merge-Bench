Based on the semantic analysis of both changes, here's the resolved version:

1. The method name `draw_image` from HEAD is more descriptive and maintains consistency with `fill_shape` (verb-noun pattern)
2. The parameter list `(image, x, y)` from the other branch matches the parameter documentation below
3. The surrounding parameter docs clearly expect three arguments (image, x, y)

Resolved code:
```ruby

  # @!method fill_shape
  # @return [nil]
  # Fill previously made shape.

  # @!method draw_image(image, x, y)
  # @param [Image] image to draw
  # @param [Numeric] x position
  # @param [Numeric] y position
  # @return [nil]
  # @example Draw a duck within a game

```
