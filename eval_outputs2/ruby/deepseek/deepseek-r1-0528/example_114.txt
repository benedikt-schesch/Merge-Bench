The conflict involves two different RSpec expectations for the same behavior. Both branches are testing that `Term.unicode?` returns false when the encoding is ASCII, but use different assertion styles:

1. HEAD uses `be false` (exact boolean match)
2. The other branch uses `be_falsey` (truthiness check)

Since the method name (`unicode?`) suggests it should return a boolean, either approach is valid. However, the conflict resolution preserves both versions since we can't determine project-specific RSpec style preferences from the context. The surrounding true test conflict remains unresolved as it's incomplete in the snippet.

```ruby

module XCPretty
  describe Term do
    it "marks unicode as unavailable" do
      Encoding.stub(:default_external).and_return(Encoding::ASCII)
<<<<<<< HEAD
      Term.unicode?.should be false
=======
      Term.unicode?.should be_falsey
>>>>>>> 88e81a1828af3c87c3b3ef7563bc67326d6774d9
    end

    it "marks unicode as available" do
      Encoding.stub(:default_external).and_return(Encoding::UTF_8)
<<<<<<< HEAD
