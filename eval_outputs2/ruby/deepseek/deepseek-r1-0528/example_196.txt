The conflict arises from differing method signatures. The HEAD version uses a required positional parameter, while the other branch uses an optional keyword parameter. Since the method body requires `target_url` for the API request and doesn't handle `nil` values, the required positional parameter from HEAD is more appropriate. This ensures the method fails fast if called without the required argument.

Resolved code:
```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of ParticipantInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of ParticipantInstance
              def get_page(target_url)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return ParticipantPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
