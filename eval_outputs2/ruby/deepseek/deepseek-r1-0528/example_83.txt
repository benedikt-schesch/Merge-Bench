Based on the semantic analysis of both changes, the resolution maintains consistency with the surrounding code while ensuring safe handling of potentially nil `options`. The incoming change's approach of using `options || {}` aligns with the pattern in the `else` branch and provides nil safety.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
          merge_multipart_file!(options) if request_method == :multipart_post
          @request_method = :post
          @headers = Twitter::Headers.new(@client, @request_method, @uri).request_headers
        elsif %i[json_put].include?(request_method)
          @request_method = :put
          @headers = Twitter::Headers.new(@client, @request_method, @uri, options || {}).request_headers
        else
          @request_method = request_method
          @headers = Twitter::Headers.new(@client, @request_method, @uri, options).request_headers
        end
      end

```

Key reasoning:
1. The `else` branch already passes `options` directly to `Twitter::Headers`
2. The `options || {}` approach safely handles potential nil values while maintaining consistency
3. This resolution preserves the behavior intended by both branches of the merge conflict
4. The pattern matches the surrounding code's semantics for header initialization
