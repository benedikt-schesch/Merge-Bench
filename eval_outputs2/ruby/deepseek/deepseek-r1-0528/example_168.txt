The conflict arises from differing method signatures. The HEAD branch uses a required positional argument, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument. The method body requires a non-nil `target_url` parameter to function correctly. Since the keyword argument version allows `nil` (via `target_url: nil`) but provides no handling for it, this would lead to runtime errors when called without a URL. The positional argument version enforces required usage.

The method comment specifies that `target_url` is an "API-generated URL for the requested results page," indicating it should always be provided. Since there's no evidence of callers omitting this parameter, the positional argument version is semantically safer.

Resolved code:
```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of DomainInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of DomainInstance
              def get_page(target_url)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return DomainPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
