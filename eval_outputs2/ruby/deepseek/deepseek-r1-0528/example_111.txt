Based on the provided code snippet, I'll resolve the merge conflict by preserving the semantic intent of both branches while maintaining consistency with the surrounding code. The conflict involves two minor differences: quote style and whitespace.

```ruby
end

class Branch < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
  belongs_to :company
  
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :name, :company
  end
end
class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :test_attrs
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. **Whitespace:** Kept the blank line before the condition for better readability (from the incoming branch)
2. **Quote style:** Used single quotes `'4'` (from the incoming branch) as it's more common in Ruby for simple strings
3. **Semantics:** Both branches implement identical functionality checking Rails version for attribute accessibility
4. **Consistency:** The resolved version maintains the original structure while cleaning up formatting

The solution preserves the behavior from both branches while improving code consistency. The blank line enhances readability between associations and conditional logic, and single quotes follow standard Ruby conventions for static string values.
