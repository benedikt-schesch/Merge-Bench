Here's the resolved code snippet preserving the context and semantics:

```ruby
      UNSAFE_ATTRIBUTES_FOR_SERIALIZATION = [:encrypted_password, :reset_password_token, :reset_password_sent_at,
        :remember_created_at, :sign_in_count, :current_sign_in_at, :last_sign_in_at, :current_sign_in_ip,
        :last_sign_in_ip, :password_salt, :confirmation_token, :confirmed_at, :confirmation_sent_at,
        :remember_token, :unconfirmed_email, :failed_attempts, :unlock_token, :locked_at]

      include Devise::DeprecatedConstantAccessor
      deprecate_constant "BLACKLIST_FOR_SERIALIZATION", "Devise::Models::Authenticatable::UNSAFE_ATTRIBUTES_FOR_SERIALIZATION", deprecator: Devise.deprecator

      included do
        class_attribute :devise_modules, instance_writer: false
        self.devise_modules ||= []

        before_validation :downcase_keys
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Both branches agree on `UNSAFE_ATTRIBUTES_FOR_SERIALIZATION` constant definition
2. The incoming branch adds important deprecation logic for API compatibility:
   - Includes `Devise::DeprecatedConstantAccessor`
   - Maps old `BLACKLIST_FOR_SERIALIZATION` to the new constant
3. The `included` block remains unchanged as it's common to both branches
4. Preserves exact spacing and line breaks from original context

The deprecation logic is semantically valuable for backward compatibility and doesn't conflict with any existing functionality in the HEAD branch.
