```ruby
      #
      # Evaluation does not update internal statistics, keeping the
      # classifier state unchanged. Use +update_with_instance+ to
      # incorporate new samples.
      def eval(data)
        metric = @distance_function || method(:distance)
        neighbors = @data_set.data_items.map do |train_item|
          [metric.call(data, train_item), train_item.last]
        end
        neighbors.sort_by! { |d, _| d }
        k_limit = [@k, @data_set.data_items.length].min
        k_neighbors = neighbors.first(k_limit)


```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. **Semantic Intent Preservation:** The conflicting code introduces a configurable distance function while maintaining fallback to the default `distance` method. The resolution preserves both:
   - The new `@distance_function` flexibility from the incoming branch
   - The original `distance` method behavior from HEAD when no custom function is set
   
2. **Behavioral Consistency:** Using `metric.call` maintains the same calculation signature as the original `distance` call, ensuring the rest of the method logic works unchanged.

3. **Completeness:** The resolution includes both the metric initialization and the updated neighbor mapping, satisfying both branches' requirements without ambiguity.
