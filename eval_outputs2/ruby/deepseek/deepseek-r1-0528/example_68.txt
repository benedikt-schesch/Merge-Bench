```ruby
      let(:path) { '/does/not/exist' }

      it { expect(subject.exists?(path)).to be(false) }
    end

    it "should create the repo, then update it given multiple successive calls." do
      expect_update_to_clone_repo!
      subject.update!(quiet: false)
      expect(File.directory?(mocked_user_path)).to be true
    end

    context "when the directory does exist" do
      context "but is empty" do
        let(:path) { Fixtures.join('empty_dir') }

        before { FileUtils.mkdir(path) }

        it { expect(subject.exists?(path)).to be(false) }

```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
I preserved both changes by:
1. Keeping the HEAD branch's test case for repository updates
2. Keeping the incoming branch's nested context for testing existing directories
3. Maintaining the correct structure by:
   - Adding the missing `end` for the HEAD test
   - Placing the test cases in logical order (unrelated test first, then related context)
   - Preserving all existing indentation and syntax

The resolution maintains both functionalities:
- The repository update test remains a top-level example
- The directory existence tests are properly nested in contexts
- The `before` hook and example remain inside the `"but is empty"` context
- All tests can coexist without conflicts as they cover different scenarios
