The conflict arises from differing method parameter styles. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument. Since the method body passes `target_url` directly to the request without handling `nil` cases, and the parameter is described as required in documentation, the positional argument is more appropriate to maintain correctness.

```ruby
              ##
              # Retrieve a single page of MessageInstance records from the API.
              # Request is executed immediately.
              # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
              # @return [Page] Page of MessageInstance
              def get_page(target_url)
                response = @version.domain.request(
                    'GET',
                    target_url
                )
                return MessagePage.new(@version, response, @solution)
