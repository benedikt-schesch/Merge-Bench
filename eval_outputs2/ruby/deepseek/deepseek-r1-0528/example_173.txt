```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of HostedNumberOrderInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of HostedNumberOrderInstance
          def get_page(target_url)
            response = @version.domain.request(
                'GET',
                target_url
            )
            return HostedNumberOrderPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
The conflict arises from a method signature change. The HEAD version uses a required positional parameter while the other branch uses an optional keyword parameter. However, the method body unconditionally uses `target_url` in the request, indicating it's required. The comment also describes it as mandatory ("API-generated URL").  

The keyword argument approach suggests flexibility, but:  
1. The default `nil` value would cause errors when used in the request  
2. There's no handling of missing URLs in the method body  
3. The surrounding context shows no other changes adapting to keyword args  

Since the method fundamentally requires a URL to function, the positional parameter (HEAD version) better matches the current implementation and documentation. The optional keyword parameter introduces a nullability that isn't supported by the existing logic.
