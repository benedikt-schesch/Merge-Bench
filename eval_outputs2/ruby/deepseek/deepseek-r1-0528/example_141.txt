The conflict involves only whitespace differences with identical logic. The trailing whitespace in the other branch version is unnecessary and can be safely removed. Here's the resolved version preserving all context:

```ruby
    def attempt_to_load(klass)
       klass.constantize
    end

    def self.db_time_now
      (ActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone == :utc) ? Time.now.utc : Time.now
    end

    protected

    def before_save

```
