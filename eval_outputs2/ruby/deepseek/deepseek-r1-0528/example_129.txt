The conflict involves two different changes at the same location in the code. The HEAD version introduces a loop to iterate through filters, while the other branch adds a type conversion hash lookup. Since the type variable used in the other branch isn't present in the HEAD version and its origin is ambiguous, the intent cannot be safely resolved. 

The unresolved conflict is preserved as requested:

```ruby
      end

      params = filters.has_key?(:__params) ? [*filters.delete(:__params)] : []
      filters[:__order] ||= [:created_at, :DESC]

<<<<<<< HEAD
      filters.each do |key, value|
=======
        type_convert = {
          boolean: '::boolean',
          integer: '::integer',
          float: '::float',
          string: '::varchar'
        }[type]

        next if [:__order, :__offset, :__count, :__params].include?(key)

        found_index = key.to_s.rindex('__')
        key_root = found_index.nil? ? key : key.to_s[0...found_index].to_sym
