Since the intent behind the two conflicting method signatures is ambiguous, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact. The choice between a required positional argument and an optional keyword argument depends on the broader context of the API design, which isn't available in the snippet.

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of DayInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of DayInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD
            def get_page(target_url)

            def get_page(target_url: nil)

              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return DayPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
