The merge conflict in the method signature cannot be resolved automatically due to ambiguous intent. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument (`target_url`), while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument (`target_url: nil`). Both versions are semantically incompatible since:
1. The method body requires `target_url` to be present (it's used directly in the request)
2. The keyword argument version allows `nil` (which would break at runtime)
3. The calling conventions are fundamentally different

Without additional context about the intended usage patterns or calling code, it's impossible to determine which approach is correct. Here's the preserved snippet with the conflict:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of ActivityInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of ActivityInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD
            def get_page(target_url)
=======
            def get_page(target_url: nil)
>>>>>>> d26f64b762b4b22ee1c64a9fbc20a393520e89e0
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return ActivityPage.new(@version, response, @solution)

```
