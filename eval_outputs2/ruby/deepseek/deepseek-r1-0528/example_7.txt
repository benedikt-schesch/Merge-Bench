```ruby
        return fetch_connection(options) if connection_stored?(options)

        connection = try_create(options)
        return connection if connection

        to_wait = deadline - ::Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
        raise Timeout::Error, "Waited #{timeout} sec" if to_wait <= 0
        @resource.wait(@mutex, to_wait)
      end
    end
  end

```

I've resolved the conflict by selecting the branch version (3e7513c) because:
1. Using `Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` is preferred for timeout calculations as it's monotonic (not affected by system clock changes)
2. The explicit namespace `::Process` makes the call unambiguous
3. This approach avoids potential timing issues that could occur with a custom `current_time` implementation

The resolution maintains the semantic intent of both branches - calculating remaining time accurately before raising timeout errors. The branch version provides a more reliable time measurement standard for timeout operations.
