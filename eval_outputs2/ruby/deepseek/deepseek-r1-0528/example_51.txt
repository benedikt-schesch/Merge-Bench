```ruby
# Configure Rails Envinronment
ENV["RAILS_ENV"] = "test"
# # require File.expand_path("../internal/config/environment.rb",  __FILE__)
SPEC_ROOT = File.dirname(__FILE__)

require 'rubygems'
require 'bundler/setup'

require 'combustion'
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
The conflict occurred between an empty line (HEAD) and a comment line (incoming branch). Both versions are functionally equivalent since:
1. The empty line improves readability by adding vertical separation
2. The comment line (`#`) contains no meaningful information
3. The surrounding context shows this is a configuration/setup section where whitespace is common

The empty line was chosen to:
- Maintain readability spacing
- Avoid an empty comment which adds no value
- Be consistent with typical Ruby style conventions for separating setup code from dependencies

The surrounding context remains unchanged as requested, with only the conflict markers removed.
