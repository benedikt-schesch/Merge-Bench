**Conflict Resolution Explanation**  
This conflict cannot be automatically resolved due to fundamental differences in intent:

1. **HEAD version** defines `euclidean_distance` as an **instance method**
2. **Branch version**:
   - Defines it as a **class method** (`self.euclidean_distance`)
   - Adds YARD documentation comments
   - Changes method scope

The choice between instance/class method depends on broader class design and usage of related methods (like `squared_euclidean_distance`), which isn't visible in this snippet. Since the change affects how the method would be called throughout the codebase, manual resolution is required.

**Recommended Next Steps**:  
Consult the original authors to determine whether this should be:
- An instance method (no `self.` prefix)
- A class method (`self.` prefix)
- Both versions (if dual interface is needed)
