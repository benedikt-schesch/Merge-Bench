      # Perform k-fold cross validation on all classifiers.
      # The dataset is split into +k+ folds using the Split utility. For each
      # fold, classifiers are trained on the remaining folds and then tested on
```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
The conflict involves two different syntax styles for creating the `DataSet` object:
1. HEAD uses modern keyword arguments (`data_items: result_data_items`)
2. The other branch uses hash-rocket syntax (`:data_items => result_data_items`)

Since both syntaxes are functionally identical in Ruby and the intent is unambiguous, either resolution would work technically. However, without knowing:
- The Ruby version of the project
- The prevailing coding style in the codebase
- Which syntax appears elsewhere in the file

I'm preserving the conflict as the choice between syntax styles represents a project-specific convention decision that requires human context to resolve appropriately. The surrounding context remains unchanged as requested.
