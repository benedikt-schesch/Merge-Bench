The conflict involves the method signature for `get_page`. Both branches require a `target_url` parameter, but differ in their approach:
- HEAD branch uses a required positional argument
- Other branch uses an optional keyword argument with nil default

The method body uses `target_url` without nil-checking, indicating it requires a value. The keyword argument approach (with nil default) would allow calling without arguments, leading to runtime errors. The positional argument enforces required usage but loses keyword flexibility.

Since the method fundamentally requires a URL to function, and both approaches are semantically incompatible (positional vs keyword), the conflict cannot be automatically resolved. Manual intervention is needed to decide which parameter style to use.

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of IpAccessControlListInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of IpAccessControlListInstance
