The conflict arises from differences in how routes are defined between the two branches. The HEAD branch uses the modern `Www::Application.routes.draw` syntax, while the other branch uses the legacy `ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw` approach. 

The resolution preserves the modern routing syntax from HEAD while incorporating the `:auth_sources` resource and route comments from the other branch. The resource declaration is converted to the modern DSL syntax (removing `map.` prefix), and the sample route in comments is updated to use `match` for consistency with the modern syntax.

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
Www::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :auth_sources

  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  
  # Sample of regular route:
  #   match 'products/:id', :controller => 'catalog', :action => 'view'
  # Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action

  match '/' => 'projects#dashboard', :as => :home
  match ':controller/service.wsdl' => '#wsdl'

  resources :hosts
```
