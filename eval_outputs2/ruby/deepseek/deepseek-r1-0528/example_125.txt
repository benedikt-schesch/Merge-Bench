```ruby

ENV['RAILS_ENV'] = 'test'
ENV['RAILS_ROOT'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '../../../..'

require 'test/unit'
require File.expand_path(File.join(ENV['RAILS_ROOT'], 'config/environment.rb'))
require 'active_record/fixtures'
require 'action_controller/test_process'

config = YAML::load(IO.read(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/database.yml'))
ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/debug.log")

```

**Resolution rationale:**  
Both conflict versions achieve the same semantic intent - loading `environment.rb` relative to the Rails root. The version using `ENV['RAILS_ROOT']` is preferable because:
1. It directly uses the RAILS_ROOT environment variable that was just set above
2. It maintains consistency with the established environment variable
3. The path construction is cleaner and avoids nested relative paths (`../../../../`)
4. Both approaches would resolve to the same absolute path since `ENV['RAILS_ROOT']` is set to `File.dirname(__FILE__) + '../../../..'`

The conflict was cleanly resolvable since both changes were semantically equivalent and the environment variable approach is more maintainable.
