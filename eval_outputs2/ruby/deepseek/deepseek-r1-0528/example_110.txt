```ruby
  end
  has_many :test_attrs
  belongs_to :test_attr
  using_access_control :include_read => true, 
    :context => :test_model_security_models
  if Rails.version < '4'
    attr_accessible :test_attr, :attr
  end
end

class Branch < ActiveRecord::Base

```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
Both sides intend to conditionally declare `attr_accessible` for Rails versions below 4. The only differences are:
1. Single vs double quotes for the version string (`'4'` vs `"4"`) - functionally identical in Ruby
2. Presence of a blank line before the condition - inconsistent with surrounding context

Resolution keeps:
- Single quotes (more Ruby-idiomatic for static strings)
- No blank line (matches the surrounding code style where macro-style declarations appear without extra spacing)

Semantic intent is fully preserved while maintaining code consistency.
