```ruby
  new_command_runner(*args) do
    program :help_formatter, Commander::HelpFormatter::Base
  end.run!    
  @output.string
end

RSpec.configure do |c|
  c.before(:each) do
    allow(Commander::UI).to receive(:enable_paging)
  end
end

```

The resolution combines both changes:
1. Preserves the command runner functionality from HEAD
2. Includes the RSpec configuration from the other branch since it:
   - Adds test setup unrelated to core functionality
   - Properly places spec configuration outside core code
   - Doesn't conflict with existing implementation
   - Maintains the blank line spacing from the original branch version

The changes are semantically compatible as one is production code and the other is test support code. The blank line after `end` is preserved from the test branch to maintain separation between the production code and test configuration.
