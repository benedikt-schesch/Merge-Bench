The merge conflict arises from differing method signatures for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional parameter `target_url`, while the other branch uses an optional keyword parameter with a default value of `nil`. 

Since the method body unconditionally uses `target_url` in the request, and the parameter is documented as required ("API-generated URL for the requested results page"), the optional keyword approach could allow nil values to propagate and cause runtime errors. 

The positional parameter approach better enforces the required nature of the URL. However, without additional context about callers (which might expect a keyword interface), the conflict remains semantically ambiguous. Therefore, the conflict is preserved for manual resolution.

```ruby
          ##
          # Retrieve a single page of AvailableAddOnInstance records from the API.
          # Request is executed immediately.
          # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
          # @return [Page] Page of AvailableAddOnInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD

            return AvailableAddOnPage.new(@version, response, @solution)
