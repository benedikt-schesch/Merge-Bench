The conflict arises from one branch adding a constant `MAX_ATTEMPTS` to the `Delayed::Job` class while the other branch doesn't modify this section. The intent is to preserve the constant addition while maintaining the existing class structure and context. Here's the resolved version:

```ruby
module Delayed

  class DeserializationError < StandardError
  end

  class Job < ActiveRecord::Base
    MAX_ATTEMPTS = 25   
    set_table_name :delayed_jobs

    cattr_accessor :worker_name
    self.worker_name = "pid:#{Process.pid}"
  

```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
- The class definition line from HEAD is preserved (`class Job < ActiveRecord::Base`)  
- The constant `MAX_ATTEMPTS = 25` from the other branch is added to the class body  
- Exact spacing from both branches is preserved (including 3 trailing spaces after the constant)  
- The existing context (table name setting and worker configuration) remains unchanged  
- This maintains both the new constant and existing class functionality
