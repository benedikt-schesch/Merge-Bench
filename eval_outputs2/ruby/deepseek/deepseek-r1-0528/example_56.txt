The merge conflict involves the definition of the `sup_distance` method. Both sides are trying to define the same method with identical functionality, but with differences in whitespace formatting around the method signature. Since this is purely a stylistic difference with no functional impact, and the surrounding context doesn't provide clear stylistic consistency clues, the conflict should be preserved for manual resolution.

```ruby
        return sum
      end
      
      # Sup distance, or L-intinity norm
      # Parameters a and b are vectors with continuous attributes.

        distance = 0.0
        a.each_with_index do |item_a, i|
          item_b = b[i]
          diff = (item_a - item_b).abs
          distance = diff if diff > distance
