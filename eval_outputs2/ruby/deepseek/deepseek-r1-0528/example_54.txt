The conflict involves a minor whitespace difference before the method definition. Both sides agree on the comment block and method implementation. The only difference is the presence of a blank line before the method definition. 

I've resolved this by keeping the blank line since:
1. It improves readability by separating the comment block from the method
2. It matches the existing whitespace pattern after the method (which has two blank lines)
3. It doesn't affect functionality

Here's the resolved code:

```ruby
      # Translations and rotations do not cause a 
      # distortion in distance relation (Duda et al, 2001)
      # If attributes are measured with different units, 
      # attributes with larger values and variance will 
      # dominate the metric.

      def euclidean_distance(a, b)
        Math.sqrt(squared_euclidean_distance(a, b))
      end
      
      

```
