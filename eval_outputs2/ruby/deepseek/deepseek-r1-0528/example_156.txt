The conflict arises from differing method signatures for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument. However, the method implementation requires `target_url` to function correctly, as it's used directly in the HTTP request. 

The keyword argument approach with a default `nil` value is unsafe since it would cause a runtime error when `target_url` isn't provided. The HEAD version's required positional argument better enforces the necessary contract described in the documentation.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```ruby
            ##
            # Retrieve a single page of ConferenceInstance records from the API.
            # Request is executed immediately.
            # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
            # @return [Page] Page of ConferenceInstance
            def get_page(target_url)
              response = @version.domain.request(
                  'GET',
                  target_url
              )
              return ConferencePage.new(@version, response, @solution)
```
