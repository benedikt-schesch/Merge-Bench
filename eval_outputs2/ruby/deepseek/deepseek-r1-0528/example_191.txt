The merge conflict arises from differing method signatures for `get_page`. The HEAD version uses a required positional argument `(target_url)`, while the other branch uses an optional keyword argument `(target_url: nil)`. 

The method body requires a non-nil `target_url` for the request to work, as shown by `@version.domain.request('GET', target_url)`. The HEAD version enforces this requirement at the method signature level by using a required positional parameter. The other branch's approach (optional keyword argument) introduces a risk of `target_url` being `nil`, which would cause a runtime error.

Since there's no context showing why the keyword argument was introduced (e.g., wider refactoring, method calls), and the method logic demands a non-nil URL, the conflict cannot be safely resolved without more information. The intent is ambiguous.

Resolved output (unchanged due to ambiguity):
```ruby
                ##
                # Retrieve a single page of AllTimeInstance records from the API.
                # Request is executed immediately.
                # @param [String] target_url API-generated URL for the requested results page
                # @return [Page] Page of AllTimeInstance
<<<<<<< HEAD
