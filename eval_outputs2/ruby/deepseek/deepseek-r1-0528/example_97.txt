The conflict arises because both branches modify the `parse_options` method differently. The HEAD branch handles both `:size` and `:s` keys by setting them to numeric values if present in the sizes mapping. The other branch only handles the `:size` key. 

Since the HEAD branch's comment explicitly mentions supporting both `:size` and `:s` ("translate :size or :s to a number"), while the other branch simplifies the logic but drops support for `:s`, the intent is ambiguous. Without knowing why the other branch removed `:s` support, it's unclear if this was intentional or an oversight. 

Therefore, the conflict cannot be automatically resolved. Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```ruby
  def self.sizes
    { :small => 50, :medium => 100, :large => 150, :big => 150 }
  end
  
  def parse_options(profile, options)
<<<<<<< HEAD
    #pass :gravatar_size through, but translate :size or :s to a number if possible
    parsed_options = parse_options_without_size(profile, options)
    [:size, :s].each do |k|
      parsed_options[k] = self.class.sizes[options[k]] if self.class.sizes.has_key?(options[k])
    end
    parsed_options
=======
    result = parse_options_without_size(profile, options)
    result[:size] = self.class.sizes[options[:size]] if self.class.sizes.has_key?(options[:size])
    result
>>>>>>> 4d94e465c7ba9410c71f4637f32892c3e588bebe
  end
  
end
