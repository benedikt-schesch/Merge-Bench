Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same code but with different changes:

1. The HEAD side is updating the subpackage path from `media.tests.cases.libs.media.adapter` and the copyright year remains `2007-2009`
2. The incoming change is updating the subpackage path to `media.tests.cases.libs.medium.adapter` (note "medium" instead of "media") and updating the copyright year to `2007-2010`

Based on the file paths in the conflict markers, it appears the incoming change is also renaming directories from "media" to "medium" (as seen in the file paths: `vendors/media/adapter/` vs `vendors/medium/adapter/`).

Since both changes appear intentional and the incoming change seems to be a more comprehensive update (including the copyright year update and consistent renaming), the semantic intent appears to be accepting the incoming changes that rename "media" to "medium" and update the copyright year.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.tests.cases.libs.medium.adapter
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
