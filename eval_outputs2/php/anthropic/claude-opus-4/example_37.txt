Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Adds a hidden input field for captcha_id after the main input field
- **179182bb93543e6fafb1ada2bbdd57fad9b84ea3 (incoming branch)**: Removes this hidden input field entirely

This appears to be a conflict between adding/keeping a captcha functionality (HEAD) versus removing it (incoming branch). Without more context about the intended direction of the codebase, I cannot determine which approach is correct. The conflict represents two different semantic intents:

1. HEAD wants to include captcha validation by storing the captcha_id in a hidden field
2. The incoming branch wants to remove this captcha functionality

Since the intent is ambiguous without knowing the broader context of what the application should do, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php
            foreach($input_attrs as $name => $val) {
                $input_attr .= sprintf('%s="%s" ', $name, htmlspecialchars($val));
            }

            $html .= sprintf('<input %s>', $input_attr);
<<<<<<< HEAD
            $html .= sprintf('<input type="hidden" id="%s_captcha_id" name="captcha_id" value="%s">', $image_id, $captcha_id);
=======
>>>>>>> 179182bb93543e6fafb1ada2bbdd57fad9b84ea3
        }

        return $html;
    }
