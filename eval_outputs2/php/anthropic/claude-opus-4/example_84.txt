Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the same comment line that describes where the `.jaxl` directory is created.

- HEAD version says: "Create .jaxl directory for our /tmp, /run and /log folders"
- The other branch says: "Create .jaxl directory in JAXL_CWD for our /tmp, /run and /log folders"

The semantic difference is that the second version is being more specific about WHERE the directory is created (in JAXL_CWD). This appears to be a documentation improvement to make the comment more precise about the location.

Since the more specific comment provides better documentation without changing the intent, I'll resolve this by keeping the more descriptive version:

```php
            pcntl_signal(SIGHUP, array($this, 'signal_handler'));
            pcntl_signal(SIGINT, array($this, 'signal_handler'));
            pcntl_signal(SIGTERM, array($this, 'signal_handler'));
        }

        // Create .jaxl directory in JAXL_CWD for our /tmp, /run and /log folders
        // overwrite these using jaxl config array
        $this->priv_dir = $this->cfg['priv_dir'];
        $this->tmp_dir = $this->priv_dir."/tmp";
        $this->pid_dir = $this->priv_dir."/run";
        $this->log_dir = $this->priv_dir."/log";

```
