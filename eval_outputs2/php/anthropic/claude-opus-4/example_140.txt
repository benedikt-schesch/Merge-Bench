Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- The HEAD side is creating a new `Item` object and pushing it to the `items` collection
- The other side is storing the last inserted item's id in `$this->last_id`

Both changes seem complementary rather than conflicting - one side is adding the item creation/storage logic, while the other is tracking the last inserted item's id. The semantic intent appears to be to both create/store the item AND track its id.

Here's the resolved version that combines both intents:

```php
	public function add($title, $options = '')
	{
	
		$id = isset($options['id']) ? $options['id'] : $this->id();

		$item = new Item($this, $id, $title, $options);
		
		$this->items->push($item);
		
		// storing the last inserted item's id
		$this->last_id = $item->id;
		
		return $item;
	}
