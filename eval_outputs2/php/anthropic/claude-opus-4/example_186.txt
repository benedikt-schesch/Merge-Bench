Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add `use` statements at the top of a PHP test file. The conflict appears to be about which imports should be included.

From the context:
- This is a test class `TestCommandService` that extends `TestCase`
- The author annotation suggests this is from an Indatus package
- The HEAD (current branch) wants to use `App`
- The incoming branch wants to use `Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\CommandService`
- Both branches already agree on using `Mockery as m` and `TestCase`

Given that this is a test file for `CommandService` (based on the class name `TestCommandService`), it makes semantic sense that it would need to import the `CommandService` class it's testing. The `App` import might also be needed for other purposes in the test.

Since both imports could potentially be needed and they don't conflict with each other, the best resolution is to include both:

```php

/**
 * @author Ben Kuhl <bkuhl@indatus.com>
 */

use App;
use Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\CommandService;
use Mockery as m;
use TestCase;

class TestCommandService extends TestCase
{

```
