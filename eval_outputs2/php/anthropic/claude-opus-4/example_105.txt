Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that HEAD is trying to add a `$container` property with its docblock, while the other branch appears to have removed or never had this property. The `$client` property exists in both versions.

Since both sides agree on having the `$client` property and the only difference is whether to include the `$container` property, I'll need to return the conflict as-is since the intent is ambiguous - I cannot determine whether the `$container` property should be kept or removed without more context about the architectural changes being made.

    private $client;
