Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - storing a file - but with different variable names and property references:

- HEAD uses `$Media->store()` with `$this->overwrite`
- The other branch uses `$Medium->store()` with `$this->_overwrite`

Given the context where we check `if (!$Media)` just above, it's clear that `$Media` is the correct variable name (not `$Medium`). The property name difference (`overwrite` vs `_overwrite`) appears to be a naming convention change.

Since the HEAD branch has the correct variable name and the conflict branch appears to have an incorrect variable name (`$Medium` doesn't match the `$Media` being checked), I'll resolve in favor of HEAD:

```php

			if (!$Media) {
				$this->err('Failed to make version ' . $version . ' of media.');
				return false;
			}
			$Media->store($Folder->pwd() . $File->name, $this->overwrite);
		}
		return true;
	}
}
?>
```
