Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Checks if `$openedData === ""`
- **Incoming branch**: Checks if `is_assoc($openedData) !== true`

Both conditions appear to be checking if `$openedData` needs to be initialized as an empty array. The key insight is that `$openedData` is the result of `json_decode()`, which can return:
- `null` if the JSON is invalid or the input is empty
- An associative array/object if the JSON represents an object
- A non-associative array if the JSON represents an array
- A scalar value (string, number, boolean)

The incoming branch's check `is_assoc($openedData) !== true` is more comprehensive as it would catch cases where `$openedData` is:
- `null` (from invalid/empty JSON)
- A non-associative array
- A scalar value
- An empty string

The HEAD's check `$openedData === ""` would only catch the case where `json_decode` somehow returned an empty string, which is unlikely since `json_decode` typically returns `null` for invalid input.

The semantic intent of both sides is to ensure `$openedData` is a valid associative array before proceeding. The incoming branch's solution is more robust.

```php
				}
				if ($userFoundInP === true || $openedWrite === "allowAll") {
					$openedData = openFile("$directory/$groupName/$otherUser/data.txt", 500000);
					$openedData = json_decode($openedData);
					
					if (is_assoc($openedData) !== true) {
						$openedData = array();
					}

					$clientData = json_decode($clientData);
