Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same file that has been moved/renamed. The conflict shows:

1. **HEAD** (current branch): The file is at `vendors/media/adapter/pear_text.php` with subpackage `media.libs.media.adapter` and copyright year `2007-2009`
2. **Incoming change**: The file is at `vendors/medium/adapter/pear_text.php` with subpackage `media.libs.medium.adapter` and copyright year `2007-2010`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- The incoming change renamed the directory from `media` to `medium` 
- The incoming change also updated the copyright year to include 2010

Since the incoming change has the more recent copyright date and appears to be a deliberate renaming of the module from "media" to "medium", I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.libs.medium.adapter
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
