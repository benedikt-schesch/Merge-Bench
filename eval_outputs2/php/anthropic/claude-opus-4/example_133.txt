Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version constant conflict in what appears to be a Laravel framework file. The conflict shows:

- HEAD (current branch): VERSION = '12.16.0'
- Incoming change: VERSION = '11.45.0'

Without additional context about which branch represents the correct version to use, I cannot determine the semantic intent. This could be:
1. An upgrade from 11.45.0 to 12.16.0
2. A downgrade from 12.16.0 to 11.45.0
3. Different branches tracking different major versions

Since the intent is ambiguous without knowing the broader context of the merge, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```php
    /**
     * The Laravel framework version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const VERSION = '12.16.0';
=======
    const VERSION = '11.45.0';
>>>>>>> 118cd9a2ba2798efaaab85a5b5056dba4832bad3

    /**
     * The base path for the Laravel installation.
     *
     * @var string

```
