Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import different classes after the `use App;` statement:

- HEAD wants to import `Artisan`
- The incoming branch wants to import `Illuminate\Contracts\Console\Kernel`

Given the context of the file which includes imports related to Indatus\Dispatcher (a Laravel task scheduling package) and the fact that both `Artisan` and `Kernel` are Laravel console-related components, it's likely that both imports may be needed for different purposes in the file.

Without being able to see how these imports are used later in the file, I cannot definitively determine if both are needed or if one supersedes the other. The safest approach is to preserve the conflict as-is.
