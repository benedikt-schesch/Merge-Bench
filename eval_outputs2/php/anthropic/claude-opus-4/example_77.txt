<think>
No reasoning found</think>
Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has added some initialization code (recording start time and seeding the random number generator) while the other branch has removed or not included this code.

From a semantic perspective, both sides seem to agree on:
1. The addon manager initialization
2. The error reporting configuration
3. The locale setting

The conflict is about whether to include the timing and random number generation code. Since this appears to be initialization code that would typically be beneficial (performance monitoring and ensuring randomness), and there's no indication that the other branch intentionally removed it for a specific reason, I'll include it in the resolution.

```php
forum_remove_bad_characters();

// The addon manager is responsible for storing the hook listeners and communicating with the addons
$flux_addons = new flux_addon_manager();

// Record the start time (will be used to calculate the generation time for the page)
$pun_start = get_microtime();

// Seed the random number generator for systems where this does not happen automatically
mt_srand();

// Make sure PHP reports all errors except E_NOTICE. FluxBB supports E_ALL, but a lot of scripts it may interact with, do not
error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE);

// Force POSIX locale (to prevent functions such as strtolower() from messing up UTF-8 strings)
setlocale(LC_CTYPE, 'C');

```
