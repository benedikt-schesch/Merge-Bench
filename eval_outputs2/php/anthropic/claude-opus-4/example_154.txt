Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to return a success response after saving the file, but with different formats:

- HEAD uses: `{"cenInfo":"updated"}` - a JSON object with a specific key
- The other branch uses: `json_encode("updated")` - which produces `"updated"` (a JSON string)

The surrounding code shows a pattern where errors are returned as JSON objects with "cenError" key (e.g., `{"cenError":"write access not granted."}`). This suggests the codebase uses a consistent format with "cenInfo" for success and "cenError" for errors.

The HEAD version aligns with this pattern and provides more structured data that would be easier for clients to parse consistently.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
							$outputData[$cpName] = $cpData;
						}
					}
					saveFile("$directory/$groupName/$otherUser/data.txt", json_encode($outputData));

					echo '{"cenInfo":"updated"}';

				} else {
					echo '{"cenError":"write access not granted."}';
				}
			} else {
```
