Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD version has an additional test method `testIsRoot()` that checks if the background process service is running as root
2. The branch version (`a3c7b58250552795d6344b24c5e3b1bbcff3c2cd`) ends the class after the `testCanRunAsUser()` method

Since both versions appear to be valid test implementations and the HEAD version simply adds an additional test method without modifying the existing code, the semantic intent seems to be to include the additional test while maintaining the class structure.

Here's the resolved version:

```php
    {
        $this->platform->shouldReceive('isWindows')->andReturn(true);

        $this->assertFalse($this->backgroundProcessService->canRunAsUser());
    }

    public function testIsRoot()
    {
        $this->assertFalse($this->backgroundProcessService->isRoot());
    }

} 
```
