Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version constant declaration. The HEAD branch has version '15.0.0-dev' while the other branch has '14.2.2'. 

Based on semantic versioning principles, the HEAD branch appears to be the development version for the next major release (15.0.0), while the other branch represents a stable release (14.2.2). Since the HEAD version is higher and marked as development, it's likely the intended forward path.

```php
    /**
     * The Cashier library version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    const VERSION = '15.0.0-dev';

    /**
     * The Stripe API version.
     *
     * @var string

```
