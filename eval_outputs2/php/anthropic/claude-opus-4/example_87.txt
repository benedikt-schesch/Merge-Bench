Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to instantiate XEP (XMPP Extension Protocol) classes, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD** side: Uses a simple approach with just `$classname = 'XEP'.$xep;`
- **Other branch** side: Uses a more elaborate approach with:
  - A filename variable for the XEP file
  - An underscore in the class name (`XEP_` instead of `XEP`)
  - A `require_once` statement to include the XEP file

The semantic intent of both sides is to:
1. Define the class name for the XEP
2. Instantiate the XEP class
3. Add callbacks for the XEP

The key difference is that the other branch explicitly handles file inclusion, which suggests it's addressing a need to load XEP classes from separate files. This is likely the more complete solution.

Here's the resolved conflict, choosing the more complete implementation from the other branch:

```php
        if (!is_array($xeps)) {
            $xeps = array($xeps);
        }
        
        foreach ($xeps as $xep) {
            $filename = 'xep_'.$xep.'.php';
            $classname = 'XEP_'.$xep;

            // include xep
            require_once JAXL_CWD.'/xep/'.$filename;
            $this->xeps[$xep] = new $classname($this);

            // add necessary requested callback on events
            foreach ($this->xeps[$xep]->init() as $ev => $cb) {
                $this->add_cb($ev, array($this->xeps[$xep], $cb));

```
