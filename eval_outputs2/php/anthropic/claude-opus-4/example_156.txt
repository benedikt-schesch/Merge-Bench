Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to return a success response after updating data, but with different formats:

- HEAD: Returns `{"cenInfo":"updated"}` - a JSON object with a specific key
- Other branch: Returns `"updated"` - a JSON-encoded string

The semantic intent appears to be returning a success indicator. The HEAD version provides more structured data with a specific key that might be expected by the client code.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```php
					$outputData[$cpName] = $cpData;
				}
			}
			saveFile("$directory/$groupName/$userName/data.txt", json_encode($outputData));

			echo '{"cenInfo":"updated"}';

		} else if ($action === "set") {

			saveFile("$directory/$groupName/$userName/data.txt", $clientData);

```
