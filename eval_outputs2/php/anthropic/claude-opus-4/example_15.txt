Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to format the same error message but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Uses `sprintf()` with a formatted string that includes `%s` placeholder for the `$name` variable
- **Branch (37b377b9df3eec460ea67080ced0c26b9430553c)**: Uses string concatenation with the `$name` variable directly interpolated

Both achieve the same semantic intent - creating an error message that includes the helper name. The `sprintf()` approach (HEAD) is generally considered more readable and maintainable for formatted strings, especially when dealing with variables.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
     */
    public function add($name, $helper)
    {
        if (!is_callable($helper) && ! $helper instanceof Helper) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException(
                sprintf(
                    "%s Helper is not a callable or doesn't implement the Helper interface.",
                    $name
                )
            );
        }
        $this->helpers[$name] = $helper;
    }


```
