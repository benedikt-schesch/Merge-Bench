Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version configuration file where two branches have different version information:

- HEAD (current branch) has version `dev-develop` with reference `0551b99775a83a964d8204d2946a0e772053360e`
- The incoming branch has version `dev-master` with reference `c18b9a2172809b787403f0aa29980a9cb5b1fd85`

Without more context about which branch should take precedence or what the intended version should be, I cannot determine the correct resolution. The conflict appears to be about which development branch and commit reference should be used.
