Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to mock the same service, but with different namespaces:

- HEAD: `Indatus\Dispatcher\Drivers\DateTime\ScheduleService`
- The other branch: `Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService`

Based on the context and typical refactoring patterns, this appears to be a namespace reorganization where `ScheduleService` was moved from `Drivers\DateTime` to a more general `Services` namespace. The second option (`Services\ScheduleService`) seems to be the more logical location for a service class, as it follows common architectural patterns where services are grouped together rather than nested under specific driver implementations.

Here's the resolved code:

```php

    public function setUp()
    {
        parent::setUp();

        $scheduleService = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService');
        $scheduleService->shouldDeferMissing();
        $this->commandService = new CommandService($scheduleService);

        //default all commands to unix
        $this->app->instance('Indatus\Dispatcher\Platform', m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Platform', function ($m) {

```
