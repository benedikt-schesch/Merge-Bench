Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same code but with different changes:

1. The HEAD side is updating the subpackage path and copyright year range to 2007-2009
2. The other side is updating the subpackage path differently (using "medium" instead of "media") and extending the copyright to 2007-2010

Based on the context and the fact that the more recent commit (1922e064...) uses 2010 and considering the file path changes from "media" to "medium", it appears the intent is to:
- Update the subpackage namespace from "media" to "medium"
- Update the copyright year to include 2010

Here's the resolved conflict:
