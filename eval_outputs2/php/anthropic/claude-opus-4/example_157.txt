Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to return a response after saving a file, but they're using different response formats:

- HEAD (current branch): Returns a JSON object with a "cenInfo" property set to "set"
- The incoming branch: Returns a JSON-encoded string with a descriptive message about what was saved

Both sides appear to be trying to provide feedback after the save operation. The incoming branch provides more informative feedback by including the username and group name in the response, which would be more helpful for debugging and user feedback.

Since both are valid JSON responses and the incoming branch provides more useful information, I'll resolve this by choosing the more descriptive response from the incoming branch:

```php
>>>>>>> 932edc459d685aded53c1b84a268053b59f506be

		} else if ($action === "set") {

			saveFile("$directory/$groupName/$userName/data.txt", $clientData);
			echo json_encode("saved to user " . $userName . " in group " . $groupName);

		} else if ($action === "permissions") {
			if ($userName !== "default") {//make sure no permissions are set on default user
				$read = $_POST['read'];
				$write = $_POST['write'];

```
