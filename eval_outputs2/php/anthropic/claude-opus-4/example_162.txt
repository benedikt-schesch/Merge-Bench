Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - encoding field names and values for URL parameters. The conflict is about which function to use:

- HEAD uses `string_url()`
- The incoming change uses `urlencode()`

Given the context of the code, where `string_url()` is consistently used in the lines above the conflict (lines 6-7), it appears that `string_url()` is likely a custom wrapper or preferred function in this codebase for URL encoding.

To maintain consistency with the rest of the code, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```php
			}
		} else if( $t_count == 1 ) {
			$t_query_array[] = string_url( $p_field_name ) . '=' . string_url( $p_field_value[0] );
		}
	} else {
		$t_query_array[] = string_url( $p_field_name ) . '=' . string_url( (string)$p_field_value );
	}

	return implode( '&', $t_query_array );
}


```
