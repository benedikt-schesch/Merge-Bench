Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Includes two imports for Symfony's DependencyInjection components:
  - `ContainerAwareInterface`
  - `ContainerInterface`
  
- **Incoming changes**: Removes these two imports

This appears to be a conflict where one side is adding dependency injection related imports while the other side doesn't have them (or has removed them). Without more context about the actual class implementation, it's difficult to determine which approach is correct.

Since the intent is ambiguous without seeing how these imports are used in the rest of the file, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php
use FOS\OAuthServerBundle\Model\ClientInterface;
use FOS\OAuthServerBundle\Model\ClientManagerInterface;
use OAuth2\OAuth2;
use OAuth2\OAuth2ServerException;
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Templating\EngineInterface;
