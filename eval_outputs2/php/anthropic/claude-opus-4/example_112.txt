Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to document the `testItShouldCreateClient` method parameters, but with different approaches:

- HEAD side: Adds a `$clientManager` parameter with `mixed` type and documents the existing `$client` parameter as `mixed`
- The other branch: Documents only the `$client` parameter as a `string` with a description "A fully qualified class name"

Based on the method signature `public function testItShouldCreateClient($client)`, which only has one parameter, and the fact that the other branch provides a more specific type and description for what `$client` represents (a fully qualified class name), it seems the HEAD side incorrectly added documentation for a non-existent `$clientManager` parameter.

The semantically correct resolution is to use the documentation from the other branch that properly documents the single `$client` parameter:

```php
    }

    /**
     * @dataProvider clientProvider
     *
     * @param string $client A fully qualified class name.
     */
    public function testItShouldCreateClient($client)
    {
        $clientManager = $this

```
