Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to instantiate a helper object, but with different class names:

- HEAD (left side): Uses `MediaHelper` class
- The other branch (right side): Uses `MediumHelper` class

Additionally, there's a difference in the assignment operator:
- HEAD uses `=&` (reference assignment, older PHP style)
- The other branch uses `=` (regular assignment, modern PHP style)

The file paths in the conflict markers also show a rename pattern:
- HEAD: `media.test.php` with `MediaHelper`
- Other branch: `medium.test.php` with `MediumHelper`

This suggests that one branch renamed the Media-related classes to Medium-related classes. Without more context about which naming convention should be used, I cannot determine the correct resolution. The intent is ambiguous as both sides appear to be valid implementations with different naming schemes.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php
			'static' => array($this->TmpFolder->pwd() . 'static' . DS => 'media/static/'),
			'filter' => array($this->TmpFolder->pwd() . 'filter' . DS => 'media/filter/'),
			'transfer' => array($this->TmpFolder->pwd() . 'transfer' . DS => false),
			'theme' => array($this->TmpFolder->pwd() . 'theme' . DS  => 'media/theme/')
		);
<<<<<<< HEAD:tests/cases/views/helpers/media.test.php
		$this->Helper =& new MediaHelper($settings);
=======
		$this->Helper = new MediumHelper($settings);
>>>>>>> 9b74c9bb43dc19b022f7e7c8860247332e6a6a78:tests/cases/views/helpers/medium.test.php
	}

	function tearDown() {
		Configure::write('Media', $this->_config);
		$this->TestData->flushFiles();

```
