Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the version number of the plugin. The HEAD branch has version 1.4.0 while the incoming branch has version 1.4.1. Since 1.4.1 is a higher version number and represents a more recent update, the semantic intent appears to be moving the plugin to the newer version.
