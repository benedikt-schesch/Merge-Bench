Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version constant conflict. The HEAD branch has version '1.1.x-dev' while the other branch has '1.0.x-dev'. 

Based on semantic versioning principles and typical development workflows, the HEAD branch appears to have the newer version (1.1.x-dev vs 1.0.x-dev). The conflict likely arose from parallel development or a merge between branches at different version stages.

The semantically correct resolution would be to keep the higher version number, which is in the HEAD branch.

```php
 * @author Kazuyuki Hayashi <hayashi@valnur.net>
 */
class Ciconia
{

    const VERSION = '1.1.x-dev';

    /**
     * @var RendererInterface
     */
    private $renderer;

```
