Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update version numbers. The HEAD branch has version 1.4.0 while the incoming branch has version 1.4.1. Since this appears to be a version bump and 1.4.1 is a higher version than 1.4.0, the semantic intent is to update to the latest version.

```php
// Exit if accessed directly.
if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
	exit;
}

define( 'CPT_VERSION', '1.4.1' ); // Left for legacy purposes.
define( 'CPTUI_VERSION', '1.4.1' );
define( 'CPTUI_WP_VERSION', get_bloginfo( 'version' ) );
