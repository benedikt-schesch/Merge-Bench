Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has the original imports, while the other side is trying to add an import for `phpseclib3\Math\BigInteger`.

Since the intent appears to be adding a new import (BigInteger) while keeping the existing ones, the semantic resolution would be to include both imports:

```php
<?php

namespace Jenssegers\ImageHash;

use JsonSerializable;
use phpseclib3\Math\BigInteger;

class Hash implements JsonSerializable
{
    /**
     * A string containing zeros and ones

```
