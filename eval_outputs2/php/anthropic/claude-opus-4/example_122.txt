Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to document the constructor parameters. The HEAD branch has proper alignment for the `@param` tags, while the incoming branch adds a new `$generator` parameter but loses the alignment.

The resolution should include both the proper formatting/alignment from HEAD and the new `$generator` parameter from the incoming branch.

```php

    /**
     * Create a new Builder instance.
     *
     * @param BuildableRepositoryInterface $database
     * @param array                        $fixtures
     * @param mixed                        $generator
     */
    public function __construct(BuildableRepositoryInterface $database, array $fixtures, $generator)
    {
        $this->database = $database;
        $this->fixtures = $fixtures;

```
