Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides have identical PHP arrays with the same dependencies (`'wp-element'` and `'wp-polyfill'`). The only difference is in the version hash:
- HEAD has version: `'af642828c64ae474a5ccc0f119470f6e'`
- The incoming change has version: `'576df7555644343f1d4ec8564e2b2d5f'`

This appears to be an auto-generated file (likely from a build process) where version hashes are updated. Since both sides have the same dependencies and only differ in the version hash, and without knowing which build is more recent or correct, I cannot determine which version should be kept.

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unresolved:

```php
<<<<<<< HEAD
<?php return array('dependencies' => array('wp-element', 'wp-polyfill'), 'version' => 'af642828c64ae474a5ccc0f119470f6e');
=======
<?php return array('dependencies' => array('wp-element', 'wp-polyfill'), 'version' => '576df7555644343f1d4ec8564e2b2d5f');
>>>>>>> 0b9cd0d78e652fa150e6c11964c89d3e9778c1e9
