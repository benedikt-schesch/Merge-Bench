Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add constants to what appears to be a PHP class. Let me analyze the intent:

- HEAD is adding `LOG_TYPE_LOG = 'log'`
- The incoming branch is adding two constants: `BASE_PATH = 'base_path'` and `LOG = 'log'`

The semantic intent seems to be:
1. Both sides want a constant for 'log'
2. HEAD uses the naming convention `LOG_TYPE_LOG` which is consistent with `LOG_TYPE_WARN` below
3. The incoming branch uses just `LOG` but also adds `BASE_PATH`

The best resolution would be to:
- Keep the `BASE_PATH` constant from the incoming branch (new functionality)
- Use the naming convention from HEAD (`LOG_TYPE_LOG`) for consistency with `LOG_TYPE_WARN`

Here's the resolved code:

```php
    const BACKTRACE_LEVEL = 'backtrace_level';

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    const BASE_PATH = 'base_path';

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    const LOG_TYPE_LOG = 'log';

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    const LOG_TYPE_WARN = 'warn';

```
