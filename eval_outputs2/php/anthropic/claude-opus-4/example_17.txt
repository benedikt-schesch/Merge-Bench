Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD has version `25.4-RC4` (a release candidate for version 25.4)
- The other branch has version `25.3.1` (a stable release)

Since `25.4-RC4` is a newer version (release candidate for 25.4) compared to `25.3.1`, the semantic intent appears to be updating to the newer version. The HEAD version should be kept.

Here's the resolved snippet:
