Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the `HEAD` branch is trying to add a variable assignment `$strpos_func = 'strpos';` while the other branch has removed or never had this line.

Given the context, this appears to be setting up function name variables, likely for string manipulation functions. The pattern shows `$strtolower_func = 'strtolower';` right after, and there's a mention of `$mb_support` and checking for mbstring extension, which suggests this code is preparing to use either regular string functions or multibyte string functions depending on the encoding support.

The intent from the `HEAD` branch seems to be to add support for position-finding in strings (strpos), which would make sense in the context of reading and processing words from a file. Since the other variables follow this pattern of storing function names, and given the multibyte support context, it's likely that `$strpos_func` would later be reassigned to `'mb_strpos'` if multibyte support is needed.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```php
     * @param int $numWords Number of words (lines) to read from the file
     * @return string|array|bool  Returns a string if only one word is to be read, or an array of words
     */
    protected function readCodeFromFile($numWords = 1)
    {
        $strpos_func     = 'strpos';
        $strtolower_func = 'strtolower';
        $mb_support      = false;

        if (!empty($this->wordlist_file_encoding)) {
            if (!extension_loaded('mbstring')) {

```
