Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update Tamil language translations for time-related strings. The conflict is about whether to include "இல்" (il) as part of the word or as a separate word:

- HEAD version: `'1 நாள் இல்'` (space before இல்)
- Other version: `'1 நாளில் இல்'` (இல் attached to நாள்/நாட்கள்)

The second version appears to be the grammatically correct Tamil format where the locative suffix "இல்" (meaning "in") should be attached to the noun rather than standing alone. In Tamil, "நாளில்" (in a day) and "நாட்களில்" (in days) are the proper forms.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
        ///

        $oneAgo = Date::parse('1 day');
        $fiveAgo = Date::parse('5 days');

        $this->assertEquals('1 நாளில் இல்', $oneAgo->ago());
        $this->assertEquals('5 நாட்களில் இல்', $fiveAgo->ago());

        ///

        $oneAgo = Date::parse('1 week');
        $fiveAgo = Date::parse('3 weeks');

```
