Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import the same classes, just in different orders. The HEAD version has the imports in a specific order, while the incoming change has them in a different order plus an additional `Response` import.

The semantic intent of both sides is to have all the necessary imports. The incoming change adds the `Response` import which seems to be needed, and both sides want the same other imports.

Here's the resolved version that preserves the context and resolves the conflict by including all imports in a logical order:

```php
 * file that was distributed with this source code.
 */

namespace FOS\OAuthServerBundle\Security\EntryPoint;

use OAuth2\OAuth2;
use OAuth2\OAuth2AuthenticateException;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AuthenticationException;
use Symfony\Component\Security\Http\EntryPoint\AuthenticationEntryPointInterface;

```
