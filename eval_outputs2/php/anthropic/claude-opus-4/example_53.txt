Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same file that has been moved/renamed between branches. The key differences are:

1. **File path**: `vendors/media/adapter/basic_text.php` vs `vendors/medium/adapter/basic_text.php`
2. **Subpackage**: `media.libs.media.adapter` vs `media.libs.medium.adapter`
3. **Copyright year**: `2007-2009` vs `2007-2010`

The intent appears to be:
- HEAD: Older version with "media" naming
- Incoming: Newer version (2010 copyright) with renamed "medium" naming

Since the incoming change has the more recent copyright date and appears to be a refactoring from "media" to "medium", the semantic intent is likely to accept the newer version.

```php

 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
