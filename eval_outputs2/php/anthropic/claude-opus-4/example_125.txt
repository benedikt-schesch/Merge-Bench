Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's about determining which version number to use for the Cashier library constant.

The HEAD branch has `15.0.0-dev` which indicates active development on the next major version (15.0.0), while the other branch has `14.14.0` which appears to be the current stable release.

Since this is a version constant conflict, the semantic intent depends on which branch should take precedence. Without knowing the broader context of the merge (e.g., whether this is merging a release branch into main, or main into a feature branch), I cannot determine which version should be used.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php
    /**
     * The Cashier library version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const VERSION = '15.0.0-dev';
=======
    const VERSION = '14.14.0';
>>>>>>> 0edb532daca386ca1c03af7d8c08de1357528286

    /**
     * The Stripe API version.
     *
     * @var string
```
