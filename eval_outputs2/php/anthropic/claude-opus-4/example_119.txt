Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is importing several classes from the Kris\LaravelFormBuilder namespace and PHPUnit, while the other branch (5e4cb54) is importing Symfony's EventDispatcher.

Since both sides are adding different import statements and there's no semantic conflict between them (they're importing different, non-conflicting classes), the resolution should include both sets of imports.

Here's the resolved code:

```php

use Illuminate\Contracts\Container\Container;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Validation\Factory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Kris\LaravelFormBuilder\Filters\FilterResolver;
use Kris\LaravelFormBuilder\Form;
use Kris\LaravelFormBuilder\FormBuilder;
use Kris\LaravelFormBuilder\FormHelper;
use Orchestra\Testbench\TestCase;
use PHPUnit\Framework\Constraint\IsIdentical;
use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcher;

class TestModel extends Model {
    protected $fillable = ['m', 'f'];

    public function getAccessorAttribute($value)

```
