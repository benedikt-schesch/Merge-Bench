Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - defining a test method with a data provider. The conflict arises from two different approaches:

- HEAD side: Uses the `@dataProvider` annotation and adds a void return type hint
- Other side: Uses the modern PHP 8 attribute syntax `#[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider('matchesDataProvider')]` but lacks the void return type

The semantic intent is clear: both want to declare a test method that uses the 'matchesDataProvider' data provider. The modern approach would be to use the PHP 8 attribute syntax while also including the void return type hint for better type safety.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
    }

    /**
     * @dataProvider matchesDataProvider
     */
    #[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider('matchesDataProvider')]
    public function testMatches($arg): void
    {
        $this->assertNull($this->matcher->doArgumentsMatch($arg));
    }

    public function testToString(): void

```
