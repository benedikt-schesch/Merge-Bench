Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - replacing hardcoded paths with variable references. The only difference is in how they access the options object:

- HEAD uses `$this->getOptions()`
- The incoming change uses `$this->options`

Both approaches are functionally equivalent (one uses a getter method, the other accesses the property directly). Since both sides have the same intent and the same resulting functionality, I'll preserve the HEAD version as it uses the getter method which is generally a better practice for encapsulation:

```php
        $cacheData = sprintf("<?php return array (%s", PHP_EOL);
        foreach ($this->fontLookup as $family => $variants) {
            $cacheData .= sprintf("  '%s' => array(%s", addslashes($family), PHP_EOL);
            foreach ($variants as $variant => $path) {
                $path = sprintf("'%s'", $path);
                $path = str_replace('\'' . $this->getOptions()->getFontDir(), '$fontDir . \'', $path);
                $path = str_replace('\'' . $this->getOptions()->getRootDir(), '$rootDir . \'', $path);
                $cacheData .= sprintf("    '%s' => %s,%s", $variant, $path, PHP_EOL);
            }
            $cacheData .= sprintf("  ),%s", PHP_EOL);
        }
        $cacheData .= ") ?>";
