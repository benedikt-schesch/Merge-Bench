Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD branch wants to add the line `$this->prefixes[$prefix] = (array) $paths;`
2. The other branch (af25d22af4fc32920cf7d332f16e832e79ac6915) removes this line entirely

Based on the context, this appears to be in a PSR-4 autoloader implementation. The code above the conflict is handling PSR-4 prefixes specifically (note the variables `prefixLengthsPsr4` and `prefixDirsPsr4`). 

The line in question (`$this->prefixes[$prefix] = (array) $paths;`) appears to be setting a more general `prefixes` property, which might be related to PSR-0 autoloading or a legacy implementation.

Given that the surrounding code is specifically handling PSR-4 prefixes and the other branch intentionally removes this line, it seems the intent is to remove this assignment as it may be redundant or incorrect in the context of PSR-4 prefix handling.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
                throw new \InvalidArgumentException("A non-empty PSR-4 prefix must end with a namespace separator.");
            }
            $this->prefixLengthsPsr4[$prefix[0]][$prefix] = $length;
            $this->prefixDirsPsr4[$prefix] = (array) $paths;
        }
    }
