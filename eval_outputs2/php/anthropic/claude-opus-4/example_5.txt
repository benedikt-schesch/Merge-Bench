Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - displaying a help text about post editor features. The only difference is in the text domain parameter of the `esc_html__()` function:

- HEAD uses: `'custom-post-type-ui'`
- The incoming change uses: `'custom_post_type_ui'` (with underscores instead of hyphens)

Given that this appears to be a WordPress plugin and the text domain should be consistent throughout the codebase, I need to check the context. Looking at the surrounding code, I can see another `esc_html__()` call on the line with "Use the 'None' option..." that uses `'custom-post-type-ui'` (with hyphens).

Since the text domain should be consistent and the surrounding context uses hyphens, the HEAD version is correct.

```php

							echo $ui->get_td_end() . $ui->get_tr_end();

							echo $ui->get_tr_start() . $ui->get_th_start() . esc_html__( 'Supports', 'custom-post-type-ui' );

							echo $ui->get_p( esc_html__( 'Add support for various available post editor features on the right. A checked value means the post type means the feature is supported.', 'custom-post-type-ui' ) );

							echo $ui->get_p( esc_html__( 'Use the "None" option to explicitly set "supports" to false.', 'custom-post-type-ui' ) );

							echo $ui->get_th_end() . $ui->get_td_start() . $ui->get_fieldset_start();
