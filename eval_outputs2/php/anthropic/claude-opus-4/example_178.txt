Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (the branch being merged in) is trying to add a `use` statement for `Indatus\Dispatcher\ConfigResolver`, while HEAD has no additional use statements beyond `use App;`.

Since this is an abstract class file and the conflict only involves adding an import statement, the intent seems clear: the incoming branch needs the ConfigResolver class for some functionality. Without seeing the rest of the class implementation, I cannot determine if this import is actually used, but adding an unused import is generally harmless.

Here's the resolved code:

```php

 * file that was distributed with this source code.
 */

use App;
use Indatus\Dispatcher\ConfigResolver;

abstract class Schedulable
{
    /** @var array $arguments */
    protected $arguments = [];

```
