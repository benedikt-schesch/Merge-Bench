Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the same test method, but with different improvements:

- **HEAD**: Adds a return type declaration (`: void`) to the method
- **BASE**: Adds a PHP 8 attribute syntax (`#[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider('typeReturnMap')]`) to replace the docblock annotation

Both changes are complementary and represent modernization of the PHP code. The semantic intent is to:
1. Use PHP 8+ attributes for the data provider (from BASE)
2. Add proper return type hints (from HEAD)

Here's the resolved conflict that combines both improvements:

```php
    }

    /**
     * @dataProvider typeReturnMap
     */
    #[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider('typeReturnMap')]
    public function testSimpleReturn($method, $expectedValue): void
    {
        $context = new \PhakeTest_ScalarTypes();
        $cb = $this->answer->getAnswerCallback($context, $method);

        $this->assertSame($expectedValue, $cb());

```
