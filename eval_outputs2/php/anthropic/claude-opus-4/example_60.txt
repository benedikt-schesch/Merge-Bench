Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same file that has been moved/renamed. The conflict shows:

1. HEAD: The file is at `vendors/media/adapter/css_tidy.php` with subpackage `media.libs.media.adapter` and copyright year `2007-2009`
2. The incoming change: The file is at `vendors/medium/adapter/css_tidy.php` with subpackage `media.libs.medium.adapter` and copyright year `2007-2010`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- The project/package was renamed from "media" to "medium"
- The copyright year was updated to 2010
- The file path and subpackage documentation should reflect this rename

Here's the resolved conflict, taking the newer "medium" naming and 2010 copyright:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.libs.medium.adapter
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
 * @license    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php The MIT License
