Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the version number of the MARKDOWNLIB_VERSION constant:

- HEAD (current branch) has version "1.9.1"
- The incoming branch has version "2.0"

Since this is a semantic versioning conflict, the intent from both sides is to update the version. The incoming branch appears to be making a major version bump (1.x to 2.0), which typically indicates breaking changes or significant updates. The HEAD branch is making a patch version update (to 1.9.1).

Given that major version changes (2.0) should take precedence over patch updates (1.9.1) as they represent more significant changes, the resolution should accept the incoming change.

```php
class Markdown implements MarkdownInterface {
	/**
	 * Define the package version
	 * @var string
	 */
	const MARKDOWNLIB_VERSION = "2.0";

	/**
	 * Simple function interface - Initialize the parser and return the result
	 * of its transform method. This will work fine for derived classes too.
	 *
