Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to set the version number of the WordPress plugin:

- HEAD (current branch) has version 1.7.2
- The incoming branch has version 1.7.1

Since 1.7.2 is a higher version number than 1.7.1, and in software development we typically want to keep the higher/newer version number, the semantic intent here is to use version 1.7.2.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
 *
 * @wordpress-plugin
 * Plugin Name: Options Framework
 * Plugin URI:  http://wptheming.com
 * Description: A framework for building theme options.
 * Version:     1.7.2

 * Author URI:  http://wptheming.com
