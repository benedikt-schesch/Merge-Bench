Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch) is adding four items to what appears to be an array of reserved post types: 'custom_css', 'customize_changeset', 'author', and 'post_type'
- The incoming branch (87a406bda6b64d7103e4334a33c192b715bca89f) has removed these four items or never had them

Since this appears to be a list of reserved post types (based on the comment below), and the HEAD branch has more comprehensive coverage of reserved terms, it makes sense to keep all four additions. These are all legitimate WordPress-related terms that should likely be reserved.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
		'nav_menu_item',
		'action',
		'order',
		'theme',
		'fields',
		'custom_css',
		'customize_changeset',
		'author',
		'post_type',
	);

	/**
	 * Filters the list of reserved post types to check against.
	 *
```
