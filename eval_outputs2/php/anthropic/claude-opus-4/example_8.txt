Looking at this merge conflict, it appears to be a simple formatting difference where one side (HEAD) has no blank line after the `do_action()` call, while the other side has added a blank line before the closing div comment.

Since this is purely a formatting/whitespace difference with no semantic changes, and maintaining consistent spacing can improve readability, I'll resolve this by keeping the blank line from the second branch:

```php
	 * @since 1.5.0
	 *
	 * @param string $tab Current tab being displayed.
	 */
	do_action( 'cptui_tools_sections', $tab );


	echo '</div><!-- End .wrap -->';
}
