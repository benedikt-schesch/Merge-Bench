Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD has version `25.4-RC4` (a Release Candidate for version 25.4)
- The incoming change has version `25.3.1` (a patch release)

From a semantic versioning perspective, `25.4-RC4` is a pre-release version of 25.4, while `25.3.1` is a stable patch release. The conflict likely arose because:
- The HEAD branch is working on the next minor version (25.4) and is in release candidate stage
- The other branch made a patch fix to the current stable version (25.3)

Since `25.4-RC4` represents a newer version (even though it's a pre-release), and the HEAD branch appears to be the development/main branch preparing for the next release, the semantic intent would be to keep the newer version number.

```php

/**
 * {@internal Nobody should be able to overrule the real version number as this can cause
 *            serious issues with the options, so no if ( ! defined() ).}}
 */
define( 'WPSEO_VERSION', '25.4-RC4' );


if ( ! defined( 'WPSEO_PATH' ) ) {
	define( 'WPSEO_PATH', plugin_dir_path( WPSEO_FILE ) );
}

```
