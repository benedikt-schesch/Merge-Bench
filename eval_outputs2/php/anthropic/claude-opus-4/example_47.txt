Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the copyright year and possibly reorganize the directory structure. The left side (HEAD) shows the path as `media.tests.cases.libs.media.adapter` with copyright years 2007-2009, while the right side shows a slightly different path `media.tests.cases.libs.medium.adapter` with updated copyright years 2007-2010.

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Update the copyright year to 2010 (from the right side)
2. There's a naming change from "media" to "medium" in the subpackage path (from the right side)
3. Both sides agree on the overall structure and other metadata

Here's the resolved version:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.tests.cases.libs.medium.adapter
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
 * @license    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php The MIT License

App::import('Vendor','Media.VideoMedia', array('file' => 'media'.DS.'video.php'));
