Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they want to read file content only if the header size is greater than 0. The only differences are in code formatting:

- HEAD version: uses `if(` without space and has trailing whitespace after the closing brace
- Other version: uses `if (` with space and proper indentation (4 spaces)

Since both achieve the same functionality, I'll resolve this by choosing the version with better formatting standards (the second one), which follows common PHP coding conventions with proper spacing and indentation.

```php
          return PclZip::errorCode();
        }

        // ----- Read the file content
        $v_content = '';
        if ($p_header['size'] > 0) {
            $v_content = @fread($v_file, $p_header['size']);
        }

        // ----- Close the file
        @fclose($v_file);

        // ----- Calculate the CRC

```
