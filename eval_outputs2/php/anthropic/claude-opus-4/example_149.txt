Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Adds a password verification check before removing a user. It reads the user's password from a file and compares it with `$clientData` before proceeding with the removal.
- **Other branch (932edc45...)**: Proceeds directly to remove the user without any verification.

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants to add security by requiring password verification before user removal
- The other branch just wants the basic removal functionality

Since the HEAD branch adds a security feature (password verification) that doesn't conflict with the core functionality, and this seems like a desirable security enhancement, I'll resolve this by keeping the password verification logic from HEAD while maintaining the removal code that follows.

```php

		} else if ($action === "getOfflinePerm") {
			$openedPerm = openFile("$directory/$groupName/$userName/offlinePerm.txt", 50000);
			echo json_encode($openedPerm);
		} else if ($action === "removeUser") {
			
			$userToRemovePass = openFile("$directory/$groupName/$userName/pass.txt", 50000);
			if ($userToRemovePass === $clientData) {
			//remove user directory
			delete_files("$directory/$groupName/$userName/");

			//remove from user list
			$users = openFile("$directory/$groupName/userlist.txt", 500000);

```
