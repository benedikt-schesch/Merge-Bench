Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - determining whether to use multi-client mode for the JAXLEvent constructor. The difference is in how they check for this configuration:

- HEAD version: Uses `$this->cfg['multi_client']` - checking a configuration array
- Other version: Uses `defined('JAXL_MULTI_CLIENT')` - checking a PHP constant

Since the HEAD version is using the instance configuration array (`$this->cfg`), which is more consistent with the object-oriented approach and allows for per-instance configuration, while the other version uses a global constant, I'll resolve in favor of the HEAD version as it provides more flexibility and better encapsulation.

```php
        } else {
            $transport = new JAXLSocketClient($this->cfg['stream_context']);
        }

        // lifecycle events callback
        $this->ev = new JAXLEvent($this->cfg['multi_client'] ? array(&$this) : array());

        // initialize xmpp stream with configured transport
        parent::__construct(
            $transport,
            $jid,

```
