Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version constant conflict in a PHP class. 

The HEAD branch has version '1.1.x-dev' which appears to be a development version for the 1.1.x series, while the other branch has '1.0.3' which is a specific release version.

Based on semantic versioning principles and the intent of both sides:
- The HEAD branch is trying to move forward to a new minor version (1.1.x) in development
- The other branch appears to be from a specific 1.0.3 release

Generally, when merging, we want to keep the more advanced/newer version. Since 1.1.x-dev represents ongoing development beyond the 1.0.3 release, the HEAD version should be kept.

```php
 * @author Kazuyuki Hayashi <hayashi@valnur.net>
 */
class Ciconia
{

    const VERSION = '1.1.x-dev';

    /**
     * @var RendererInterface
     */
    private $renderer;

```
