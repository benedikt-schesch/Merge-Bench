Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The file was moved/renamed between branches:
   - HEAD: `src/Indatus/Dispatcher/Drivers/DateTime/Scheduler.php`
   - Other branch: `src/Indatus/Dispatcher/Drivers/Cron/Scheduler.php`

2. The conflict is about whether to include a docblock comment for the `ANY` constant
   - HEAD: No comment before the constant
   - Other branch: Added a docblock comment explaining what `ANY` represents

Since the docblock provides useful documentation about what the `ANY` constant represents ("Any of the contextual time frame"), and doesn't conflict with the functionality, the semantic intent is to keep the documentation while preserving the code structure.

Here's the resolved version:

```php
use Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\Schedulable;

class Scheduler extends Schedulable
{
    /**
     * @var string Any of the contextual time frame
     */
    const ANY = '*';

    const NONE = '-';

    private $scheduleWeek = self::NONE;

```
