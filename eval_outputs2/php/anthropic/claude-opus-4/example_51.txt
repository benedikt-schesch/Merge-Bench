Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same file that has been moved/renamed and had its metadata updated. The conflict involves:

1. File path change: `vendors/media/js.php` vs `vendors/medium/js.php`
2. Subpackage name change: `media.libs.media` vs `media.libs.medium`
3. Copyright year update: `2007-2009` vs `2007-2010`

Based on the pattern and the fact that the right side (HEAD) has both a more recent copyright year (2010) and what appears to be a deliberate rename from `media` to `medium` in the path and subpackage, the intent seems to be to accept the changes from the right side.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.libs.medium
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
 * @license    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php The MIT License
 * @link       http://github.com/davidpersson/media
 */
App::import('Vendor', 'Media.Media');
