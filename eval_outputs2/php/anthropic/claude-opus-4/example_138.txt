Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's about whether to include a `@return void` annotation in the PHPDoc comment for what appears to be a constructor method.

The semantic intent from both sides:
- HEAD (current branch): Does not include the `@return void` annotation
- The incoming change: Adds `@return void` annotation

Since this is a constructor (`__construct`), it's worth noting that in PHP, constructors don't have explicit return types and implicitly return void. In modern PHPDoc standards, it's actually recommended NOT to add `@return void` annotations for constructors since it's redundant and implicit.

Following the principle of modern PHPDoc best practices, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version without the `@return void` annotation:

```php
     * @param  \Illuminate\Contracts\Session\Session  $session
     * @param  \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request|null  $request
     * @param  \Illuminate\Support\Timebox|null  $timebox
     * @param  bool  $rehashOnLogin
     * @param  int  $timeboxDuration
     */
    public function __construct(
        $name,
        UserProvider $provider,
        Session $session,

```
