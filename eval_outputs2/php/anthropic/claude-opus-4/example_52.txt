Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same package documentation, but with different changes:

- **HEAD** side: Uses `media.libs.media` as subpackage and copyright years `2007-2009`
- **Other** side: Uses `media.libs.medium` as subpackage and copyright years `2007-2010`

Additionally, the file paths in the conflict markers suggest a rename:
- HEAD: `vendors/media/media.php`
- Other: `vendors/medium/medium.php`

Based on the context, it appears the "Other" side represents a more recent update that:
1. Renamed the subpackage from `media` to `medium`
2. Updated the copyright year to 2010
3. Possibly renamed the file/directory structure

The semantic intent seems to be updating the package structure and copyright information. The "Other" side appears to be the more recent and intended change.

Here's the resolved version:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.libs.medium
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
 * @license    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php The MIT License
 * @link       http://github.com/davidpersson/media
 */
App::import('Vendor', 'Media.MimeType');
