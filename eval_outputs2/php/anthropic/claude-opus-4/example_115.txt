Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is adding a line that calls `flattenWhereConditions($whereConditions)` to process the input parameter before proceeding with the rest of the method, while the other branch keeps the original implementation without this preprocessing step.

The intent appears to be that HEAD wants to flatten the where conditions before processing them further in the method. This seems like a preprocessing step that would normalize or simplify the structure of `$whereConditions` before extracting the keys, values, operators, etc.

Since this appears to be an intentional addition to preprocess the data, and there's no conflicting logic (the other branch simply doesn't have this line), the semantic resolution would be to keep the flattening operation from HEAD.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
        $this->whereSQL .= "$key $isCondition NULL $combine ";
    }

    private function retrieveConditions($whereConditions)
    {
        $whereConditions = flattenWhereConditions($whereConditions);
        $whereKey = [];
        $whereValue = [];
        $operator = [];
        $extra = [];
        $combiner = [];

```
