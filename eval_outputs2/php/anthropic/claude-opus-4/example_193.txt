Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - marking this test method with a 'testonly' group annotation. The conflict arises from two different approaches:

1. **HEAD side**: Uses the older PHPDoc `@group testonly` annotation and has a void return type declaration
2. **Other side**: Uses the newer PHP 8 attribute syntax `#[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Group('testonly')]` and has no return type

Since both annotations serve the same purpose, the semantic intent is to keep the test grouped as 'testonly'. The modern best practice would be to use the PHP 8 attribute syntax and include the return type declaration for better type safety.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```php

    /**
     * Tests that calling a stubbed method will result in the stubbed answer being returned.
     */
    #[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Group('testonly')]
    public function testStubbedMethodsReturnStubbedAnswer(): void
    {
        $newClassName = str_replace('\\', '_', self::class) . '_TestClass7';
        $mockedClass  = \PhakeTest_MockedClass::class;

        $this->classGen->generate($newClassName, $mockedClass, $this->infoRegistry);

```
