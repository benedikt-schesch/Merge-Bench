Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to accomplish the same goal - setting up the necessary dependencies for the test file - but using different approaches:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Using modern PHP namespaces and `use` statements
- **efa5c907b3 (right side)**: Using older `require_once` statements with file paths

Given that the HEAD side is using modern PHP namespace conventions (which is the standard practice in modern PHP development), and the right side is using the older require_once approach, the semantic intent is to include the necessary dependencies. The modern namespace approach should be preferred as it's more maintainable and follows PHP standards.

Here's the resolved conflict:
