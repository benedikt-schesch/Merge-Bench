Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - creating nullable datetime columns for 'created_at' and 'updated_at' with an optional precision parameter. The key difference is:

- HEAD version: Creates the columns but doesn't return anything
- Incoming version: Creates the same columns but returns them in a Collection

Based on the method's return type annotation (`@return \Illuminate\Support\Collection<int, \Illuminate\Database\Schema\ColumnDefinition>`), the incoming version is correct as it properly returns a Collection as documented.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```php
     * @param  int|null  $precision
     * @return \Illuminate\Support\Collection<int, \Illuminate\Database\Schema\ColumnDefinition>
     */
    public function datetimes($precision = null)
    {
        return new Collection([
            $this->datetime('created_at', $precision)->nullable(),
            $this->datetime('updated_at', $precision)->nullable(),
        ]);
    }

    /**
     * Add a "deleted at" timestamp for the table.
     *

```
