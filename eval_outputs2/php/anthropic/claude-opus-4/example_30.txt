Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the only difference between the two sides is the presence or absence of a blank line after the `$productId` assignment.

The HEAD version has a blank line, while the incoming branch (59acc8e...) does not. Since this is purely a whitespace/formatting difference with no semantic impact, and both sides continue with the same code (setting `$ip` and `$nowtime`), I'll preserve the blank line from HEAD as it provides better visual separation between the variable assignments.

```php
        $this->load->model('servicepublicclass/clientdatapublic', 'clientdatapublic');
        $clientdata = new clientdatapublic();
        $clientdata->loadclientdata($content);
		
        $productId = $this -> utility -> getProductIdByKey($clientdata -> appkey);
        
        $ip = $this -> utility -> getOnlineIP();
        $nowtime = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
        if (isset($clientdata -> time)) {
            $nowtime = $clientdata -> time;

```
