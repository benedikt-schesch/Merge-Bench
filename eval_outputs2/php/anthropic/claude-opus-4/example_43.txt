Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same file that has been moved/renamed. The conflict shows:

1. **LEFT side (HEAD)**: File is at `vendors/media/adapter/basic_image.php` with subpackage `media.libs.media.adapter` and copyright years `2007-2009`
2. **RIGHT side**: File is at `vendors/medium/adapter/basic_image.php` with subpackage `media.libs.medium.adapter` and copyright years `2007-2010`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- The RIGHT side has renamed the package from `media` to `medium` 
- The RIGHT side has updated the copyright year to include 2010
- Both sides maintain the same author and license

Since the RIGHT side appears to be a more recent refactoring (renaming media â†’ medium and updating copyright to 2010), the resolution should favor the RIGHT side changes:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.libs.medium.adapter
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
 * @license    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php The MIT License
