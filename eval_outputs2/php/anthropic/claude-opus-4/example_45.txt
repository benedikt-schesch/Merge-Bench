Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update different aspects of the same file header:

- **HEAD** is updating the file path from some previous location to `vendors/media/generic.php` and keeping the copyright year as `2007-2009`
- **The incoming change** is updating both the file path to `vendors/medium/generic.php`, changing the subpackage from `media.libs.media` to `media.libs.medium`, and updating the copyright year to `2007-2010`

The semantic intent appears to be that the incoming change is a more comprehensive update that:
1. Renames the directory from `media` to `medium`
2. Updates the subpackage name accordingly
3. Updates the copyright year

Since the incoming change seems to be the more recent and complete update (newer copyright year and consistent naming), I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.libs.medium
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
 * @license    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php The MIT License
 * @link       http://github.com/davidpersson/media
 */
App::import('Vendor', 'Media.Media');
