Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. HEAD (current branch) wants the class to extend `LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase`
2. The incoming branch (5a4e0153f45d48bdd45683584367d53a9ff4fa05) wants the class to not extend anything

Without more context about the intent of both changes, I cannot determine which approach is correct. The conflict appears to be a fundamental architectural decision about whether this middleware should extend a base class or not.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php
namespace Mcamara\LaravelLocalization\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse;

<<<<<<< HEAD
class LocaleSessionRedirect extends LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase {

=======
class LocaleSessionRedirect
{
>>>>>>> 5a4e0153f45d48bdd45683584367d53a9ff4fa05
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param \Illuminate\Http\Request $request
     * @param \Closure                 $next
```
