Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update version-related constants:

- HEAD (current branch) has PHP minimum version 7.0.0 and FreshRSS version 1.20.2
- The incoming changes have PHP minimum version 7.2.0 and FreshRSS version 1.21.0

Since this appears to be a version upgrade scenario where the incoming changes represent a newer version (1.21.0 > 1.20.2), and it makes sense that a newer version might require a higher minimum PHP version, the semantic intent seems to be accepting the newer version requirements.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
<?php
//NB: Do not edit; use ./constants.local.php instead.

//<Not customisable>
define('FRESHRSS_MIN_PHP_VERSION', '7.2.0');
define('FRESHRSS_VERSION', '1.21.0');
define('FRESHRSS_WEBSITE', 'https://freshrss.org');
define('FRESHRSS_WIKI', 'https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/');

define('APP_NAME', 'FreshRSS');


```
