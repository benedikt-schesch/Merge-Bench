Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD has `'13.x-dev'` - indicating active development on version 13
- The other branch has `'12.14.1'` - indicating a specific release version of Laravel 12

This appears to be a conflict between a development branch (13.x) and a stable release branch (12.14.1). Without additional context about which branch should take precedence or what the intended merge direction is, I cannot determine which version should be kept.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php
    /**
     * The Laravel framework version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const VERSION = '13.x-dev';
=======
    const VERSION = '12.14.1';
>>>>>>> 84b142958d1638a7e89de94ce75c2821c601d3d7

    /**
     * The base path for the Laravel installation.
     *
     * @var string
```
