Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar functionality - creating database columns for what appears to be a nested set model (with left, right, and parent_id columns).

The key differences are:
1. **HEAD** uses `self::` to reference the class constants and adds `->default(0)` to the LFT and RGT columns
2. **The other branch** uses `static::` to reference the class constants and doesn't set default values

From a semantic perspective:
- Using `static::` is generally preferred over `self::` in Laravel/PHP for late static binding, allowing child classes to override these constants
- The `->default(0)` on the LFT and RGT columns makes sense for a nested set implementation, as new nodes typically start with 0 values

The best resolution would combine both improvements:

```php
     *
     * @param \Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint $table
     */
    public static function columns(Blueprint $table)
    {
        $table->unsignedInteger(static::LFT)->default(0);
        $table->unsignedInteger(static::RGT)->default(0);
        $table->unsignedInteger(static::PARENT_ID)->nullable();

        $table->index(static::getDefaultColumns());
    }
