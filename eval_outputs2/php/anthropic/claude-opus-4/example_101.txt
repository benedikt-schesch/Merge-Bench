Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Has the `global_namespace_import` configuration and wants to continue directly to `new_with_parentheses`
- **Incoming change**: Wants to add `'list_syntax' => ['syntax' => 'short']` after `global_namespace_import`

Both sides seem to have valid configuration options for what appears to be a PHP code style configuration file (likely PHP-CS-Fixer). The semantic intent is to have both configuration options included, as they configure different aspects of code formatting.

The resolution should include both the `global_namespace_import` setting and the `list_syntax` setting:

```php
        'global_namespace_import' => [
            'import_classes' => true,
            'import_constants' => true,
            'import_functions' => true,
        ],
        'list_syntax' => ['syntax' => 'short'],
        'new_with_parentheses' => true,
        'no_blank_lines_after_phpdoc' => true,
        'no_empty_phpdoc' => true,
        'no_empty_comment' => true,
        'no_leading_import_slash' => true,
```
