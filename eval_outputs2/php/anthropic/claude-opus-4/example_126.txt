Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version constant declaration. The conflict shows:
- HEAD (current branch): `15.0.0-dev` - indicating development version for the next major release
- Incoming change: `14.12.0` - indicating a stable release version

Based on semantic versioning and typical development workflows, the HEAD version (`15.0.0-dev`) appears to be the development branch for the next major version, while the incoming change (`14.12.0`) seems to be from a stable release branch.

Since we're likely on the development branch (given the `-dev` suffix), we should keep the HEAD version to maintain the development version numbering:

```php
    /**
     * The Cashier library version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    const VERSION = '15.0.0-dev';

    /**
     * The Stripe API version.
     *
     * @var string
```
