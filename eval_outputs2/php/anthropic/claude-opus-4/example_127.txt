Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD (current branch) has version `15.0.0-dev` - indicating active development on version 15
- The incoming branch has version `14.6.0` - indicating a stable release version

Based on semantic versioning and typical development workflows, the HEAD version (`15.0.0-dev`) appears to be the correct choice since:
1. It's a higher major version (15 vs 14)
2. The `-dev` suffix indicates this is the development branch
3. Version 14.6.0 appears to be from a previous stable release

Here's the resolved code:

```php
    /**
     * The Cashier library version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    const VERSION = '15.0.0-dev';

    /**
     * The Stripe API version.
     *
     * @var string
```
