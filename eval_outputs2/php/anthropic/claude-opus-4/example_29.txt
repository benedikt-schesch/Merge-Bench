Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

**HEAD (current branch):**
- Uses fully qualified column names: `Post.content, Post.title`
- Basic MATCH AGAINST syntax without mode specification

**Incoming changes:**
- Uses unqualified column names: `content, title`
- Adds `IN BOOLEAN MODE` to the MATCH AGAINST clause

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to perform a fulltext search using MySQL's MATCH AGAINST
2. The incoming change wants to use BOOLEAN MODE for more precise search capabilities
3. The HEAD version uses fully qualified column names which is generally better practice to avoid ambiguity

The best resolution would combine both improvements: keep the fully qualified column names from HEAD and add the BOOLEAN MODE from the incoming changes.

```php
                            ),
                            'fields' => array('Answer.id')
                        )
                    ),
                    'fields' => array(
						"match(Post.content, Post.title) against(" . $escapedNeedle . " IN BOOLEAN MODE) as relevance",
                        'Post.title', 'Post.views', 'Post.url_title', 'Post.public_key',
                        'Post.timestamp', 'User.username', 'User.public_key', 'User.image',
                        'User.reputation'),
                    'order' => 'relevance DESC',
                    'limit' => $record . ',' . 15)

```
