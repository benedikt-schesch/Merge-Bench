Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the package metadata, but with different changes:

- HEAD is updating the subpackage path from `media.tests.cases.libs.media.adapter` 
- The other branch is updating both the subpackage path (to `media.tests.cases.libs.medium.adapter`) and the copyright year (from 2009 to 2010)

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Update the subpackage path to reflect a rename from "media" to "medium"
2. Update the copyright year to 2010

Since both changes seem intentional and compatible, the resolution should include both the new subpackage path and the updated copyright year:
