Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version constant conflict in what appears to be a Laravel framework file. The HEAD branch shows version 12.18.0 while the incoming branch shows version 11.45.1.

Based on semantic versioning, 12.18.0 is a newer major version compared to 11.45.1. In framework version conflicts like this, the intent is typically to keep the most recent/highest version number, which would be 12.18.0 from the HEAD branch.

```php
    /**
     * The Laravel framework version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    const VERSION = '12.18.0';

    /**
     * The base path for the Laravel installation.
     *
     * @var string
```
