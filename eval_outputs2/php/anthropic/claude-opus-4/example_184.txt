Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the PHPDoc comment for the `$minutesIntoTheHour` parameter type. 

The HEAD branch specifies `int|array` which is more specific and indicates the method accepts either an integer or an array. The other branch uses `mixed` which is more generic but less informative.

Given that the parameter name suggests it could be a single minute value or multiple minutes, and considering the method name `parseTimeParameter()` being called suggests it handles multiple types, the more specific `int|array` documentation from HEAD provides better semantic clarity and intent.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
        return $this;
    }

    /**
     * Set the minutes under which this command will run
     * @param  int|array $minutesIntoTheHour
     * @return $this
     */
    public function minutes($minutesIntoTheHour)
    {
        $this->setScheduleMinute($this->parseTimeParameter($minutesIntoTheHour));

```
