Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has removed the Doctrine annotation imports while the incoming branch (45c19c9ddddc07c9cd29311ec646c285f9ffa07f) still has them.

Given that this appears to be a namespace/import section and the HEAD branch has intentionally removed these Doctrine-related imports (likely as part of removing a dependency or refactoring), while the incoming branch still references them, I cannot definitively resolve this without understanding the broader context of why these changes were made.

The semantic intent is ambiguous here - it could be:
1. A refactoring where Doctrine annotations were removed from the codebase (HEAD's intent)
2. A feature addition that requires these imports (incoming branch's intent)
3. Parallel development where both changes are needed but in different parts of the code

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact:
