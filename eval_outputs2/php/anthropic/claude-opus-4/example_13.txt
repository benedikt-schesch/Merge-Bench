Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to format the `$Subscribers` variable using `number_format()`. The key difference is:

- HEAD (current branch): Explicitly casts `$Subscribers` to `(int)` before formatting
- The incoming change: Uses `$Subscribers` directly without casting

Since `number_format()` expects a numeric value and will handle type conversion internally, both approaches achieve the same semantic intent - displaying the subscriber count as a formatted number. However, the HEAD version with explicit `(int)` casting is more defensive programming, ensuring that even if `$Subscribers` contains a non-numeric string or null value, it will be safely converted to 0 rather than potentially causing warnings.

Given that both sides want to format the number and the HEAD version is more robust, I'll resolve in favor of HEAD:

```php
		</div>
		<div class="box box_info box_statistics_collage_torrents">
			<div class="head"><strong>Stats</strong></div>
			<ul class="stats nobullet">
				<li>Artists: <?=number_format($NumArtists)?></li>
				<li>Subscribers: <?=number_format((int)$Subscribers)?></li>
				<li>Built by <?=number_format(count($Users))?> user<?=(count($Users) > 1 ? 's' : '')?></li>
				<li>Last updated: <?=time_diff($Updated)?></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="box box_contributors">

```
