Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the `getPrefixes()` method, but they have different implementations that reflect different architectural approaches:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Simply returns `$this->prefixes`
- **Incoming changes (right side)**: Returns a merged array from `$this->prefixesPsr0` and also adds a new method `getPrefixesPsr4()` that returns `$this->prefixDirsPsr4`

The semantic intent appears to be that the codebase is transitioning from a simple prefix system to supporting both PSR-0 and PSR-4 autoloading standards. The incoming changes are trying to:
1. Update `getPrefixes()` to work with PSR-0 prefixes specifically
2. Add support for PSR-4 prefixes with a new method

Since the intent seems to be adding PSR-4 support while maintaining backward compatibility, I'll resolve this by accepting the incoming changes which provide the more complete implementation:

```php
    private $useIncludePath = false;
    private $classMap = array();

    public function getPrefixes()
    {
        return call_user_func_array('array_merge', $this->prefixesPsr0);
    }

    public function getPrefixesPsr4()
    {
        return $this->prefixDirsPsr4;
    }

    public function getFallbackDirs()
    {
        return $this->fallbackDirsPsr0;
```
