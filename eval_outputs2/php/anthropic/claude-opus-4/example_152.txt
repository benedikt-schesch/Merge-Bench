Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch): Returns a JSON response with `{"cenInfo":"set"}` to indicate success
- Incoming branch: Returns a JSON-encoded string with a descriptive message about what was saved

Both sides are trying to provide feedback after a successful save operation, but they're using different response formats. The HEAD version uses a consistent JSON structure that matches the error responses (which use `{"cenError":"..."}` format), while the incoming branch provides more detailed information about the operation.

Given that the error responses in this code use the `{"cenError":"..."}` format, it would be more consistent to use a similar format for success responses. However, the incoming branch provides valuable context about what was actually saved.

The best resolution would combine both approaches: use the consistent JSON format while including the descriptive information.

```php
						$userFoundInP = true;
					}
				}
				if ($userFoundInP === true || $openedWrite === "allowAll") {
					saveFile("$directory/$groupName/$otherUser/data.txt", $clientData);
					echo json_encode(array("cenInfo" => "saved to user " . $otherUser . " in group " . $groupName));
				} else {
					echo '{"cenError":"write access not granted."}';
				}
			} else {
				echo '{"cenError":"user does not exist."}';

```
