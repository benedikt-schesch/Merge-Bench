Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update placeholder database configuration values. The key difference is:

- HEAD uses shorter placeholders and specifies 'qwench' as the database name
- The incoming change uses longer placeholders with '_here' suffix and keeps the database name as a placeholder

Since both sides appear to be updating placeholder values (not actual credentials), and the HEAD version has a specific database name 'qwench' which likely indicates the actual database name for this application, I'll preserve the HEAD version as it contains more specific information.

```php
<?php

// Database Details
define('SERVERNAME','localhost');
define('SERVERPORT','3306');
define('DBUSERNAME','your_db_username');
define('DBPASSWORD','your_db_password');
define('DBNAME','qwench');

Define('ANSWERS_PER_PAGE','10');
define('QUESTIONS_PER_PAGE','10');

//if you want to enable production mode vs debug mode (useful for error reporting)

```
