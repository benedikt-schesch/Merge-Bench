Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version constant conflict in what appears to be a Laravel framework file.

The HEAD branch shows `'13.x-dev'` which indicates active development on version 13.x, while the incoming change shows `'12.18.0'` which is a stable release version from the 12.x series.

Since the HEAD branch represents the newer major version (13.x) in development, and this appears to be the main development branch moving forward, the semantic intent would be to keep the HEAD version.

```php
    /**
     * The Laravel framework version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    const VERSION = '13.x-dev';

    /**
     * The base path for the Laravel installation.
     *
     * @var string
```
