Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar goals but with different approaches:

- **HEAD** (left side): Adds a return type hint `: void` to the test method
- **Right side**: Replaces the `@dataProvider` annotation with the modern PHP 8 attribute syntax `#[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider('magicGetInvalidData')]`

Both changes are complementary and represent modernization efforts - one for type safety and one for using PHP 8 attributes. The semantic intent is to improve the test method declaration, and both changes can be combined.

Here's the resolved code:

```php


    /**
     * @dataProvider magicGetInvalidData
     */
    #[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider('magicGetInvalidData')]
    public function testMagicGetWithInvalidData($invalidData, $exceptionContains): void
    {
        $this->expectException(\InvalidArgumentException::class);
        $this->proxy->__get($invalidData);
    }


```
