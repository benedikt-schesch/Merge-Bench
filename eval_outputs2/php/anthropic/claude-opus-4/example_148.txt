Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - returning a JSON response about permission updates. The key differences are:

1. **HEAD** uses a specific JSON format with `cenInfo` and `cenError` keys
2. **932edc4** uses `json_encode()` to encode plain strings

Since both sides want JSON responses and the HEAD version uses a more structured format with specific keys (`cenInfo` for success, `cenError` for errors), I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version's approach as it provides more semantic meaning to the response type.

```php
						}
					}

					saveFile("$directory/$groupName/$userName/propertyPerm.txt", json_encode($outputPermProperties));
				}
				echo '{"cenInfo":"permissions updated"}';
			} else {
				echo '{"cenError":"permissions cannot be edited on default user"}';
			}

		} else if ($action === "getOfflinePerm") {
			$openedPerm = openFile("$directory/$groupName/$userName/offlinePerm.txt", 50000);
			echo json_encode($openedPerm);

```
