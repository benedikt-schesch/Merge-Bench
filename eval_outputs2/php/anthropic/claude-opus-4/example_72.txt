Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic difference between the two conditions:

- **HEAD**: `!empty($checkFields[0])` - checks if the value exists AND is not empty
- **Branch**: `isset($checkFields[0])` - only checks if the value exists

The key difference is that `!empty()` is more restrictive - it will return false for values like `0`, `'0'`, `false`, `null`, `''`, and `[]`, while `isset()` will return true for all of these except `null`.

Looking at the context, this code is building query conditions by checking fields. The subsequent code assumes that if we enter this block, we have a valid field to work with. The more permissive `isset()` check seems more appropriate here because:

1. It allows numeric `0` values which could be valid field indices
2. It's consistent with the other `isset()` checks used in the same code block
3. The intent appears to be checking for the existence of the field rather than its "truthiness"

Here's the resolved code:

```php
                $whereKey[] = $checkFields[0];
                $whereValue[] = \array_slice((array) $checkFields, 2);
                $combiner[] = \_AND;
                $extra[] = null;
            } else {
                if (isset($checkFields[0])) {
                    $whereKey[] = $checkFields[0];
                    $whereValue[] = (isset($checkFields[2])) ? $checkFields[2] : '';
                    $combiner[] = (isset($checkFields[3])) ? $checkFields[3] : \_AND;
                    $extra[] = (isset($checkFields[4])) ? $checkFields[4] : null;
                }
```
