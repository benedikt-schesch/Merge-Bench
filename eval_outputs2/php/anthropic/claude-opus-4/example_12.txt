Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - checking if a specific plugin path exists in the `$extras['plugins']` array using `in_array()`.

The only difference between the two versions is:
- HEAD version: includes the `true` parameter for strict comparison
- Other version: omits the strict comparison parameter

Since this is checking for a string value ('custom-post-type-ui/custom-post-type-ui.php') in an array, and the semantic intent is the same on both sides, I'll resolve this by keeping the more explicit version with the strict comparison parameter, as it's a better practice in PHP to use strict comparisons when possible.

```php
	if ( ! array_key_exists( 'plugins', $extras ) || ! is_array( $extras['plugins'] ) ) {
		return;
	}

	// Was CPTUI updated?
	if ( ! in_array( 'custom-post-type-ui/custom-post-type-ui.php', $extras['plugins'], true ) ) {
		return;
	}

	// If we are already known as not new, return.
	if ( cptui_is_new_install() ) {

```
