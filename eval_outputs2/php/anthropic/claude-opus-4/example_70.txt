Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Sets up an event dispatcher on the connection
- Incoming branch: Sets up a paginator on the connection

Both sides appear to be configuring different aspects of the same connection object. These are not mutually exclusive operations - a connection can have both an event dispatcher AND a paginator. The intent seems to be to set up various components on the connection object.

Given that both configurations are likely needed and don't conflict with each other semantically, the resolution should include both lines:

```php
// http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#page-14
//
\Carbon\Carbon::setToStringFormat('Y-m-d\TH:i:sP');

// Setup paginator
$connection->setEventDispatcher($event_dispatcher);
$connection->setPaginator(new Hook\Pagination\Environment());

// Setup Schema Grammar
// $connection->setSchemaGrammar();


```
