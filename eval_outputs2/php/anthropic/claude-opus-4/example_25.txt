Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD branch (current) has nothing after the `define('BASE_PATH',BASE_DIR);` line
2. The incoming branch is trying to add two new configuration constants:
   - `SITE_TITLE` - for defining the site's title
   - A commented out `DEBUG_ENABLED` constant

Both changes appear to be compatible - the incoming branch is simply adding new configuration options that don't conflict with the existing BASE_PATH definition. The intent seems to be expanding the configuration file with additional settings.

Here's the resolved version:

```php

// If URL-Rewriting does not work then set
// define('BASE_PATH',BASE_DIR.'/index.php');
// If URL-Rewriting works, then leave the line below as is
define('BASE_PATH',BASE_DIR);
define('SITE_TITLE', 'Your Site');
// define('DEBUG_ENABLED', true);

```
