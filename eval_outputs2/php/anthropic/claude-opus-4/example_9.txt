Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) added a `@return string` documentation line, while the other side removed or didn't include it. Since this is a function that appears to generate output for a single taxonomy (based on the function name and description), and the function name suggests it returns something ("get_single_taxonomy_registery"), it makes semantic sense to include the return type documentation.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
 * Create output for single taxonomy to be ready for copy/paste from Get Code.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
 *
 * @param array $taxonomy Taxonomy data to output. Optional.
 * @return string
 */
function cptui_get_single_taxonomy_registery( $taxonomy = array() ) {

	$post_types = "''";
	if ( is_array( $taxonomy['object_types'] ) ) {

```
