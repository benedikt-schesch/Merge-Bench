Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the copyright year and the subpackage path. The conflict shows:

- HEAD (left side): Uses `media.libs.media.adapter` as subpackage and copyright year `2007-2009`
- Other branch (right side): Uses `media.libs.medium.adapter` as subpackage and copyright year `2007-2010`

Based on the file paths shown in the conflict markers:
- HEAD: `vendors/media/adapter/imagick_shell.php`
- Other: `vendors/medium/adapter/imagick_shell.php`

It appears the project underwent a rename from "media" to "medium" in the directory structure, and the copyright was updated to 2010. The semantic intent is to update both the subpackage namespace to reflect the new structure and extend the copyright year.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.libs.medium.adapter
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
 * @license    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php The MIT License
