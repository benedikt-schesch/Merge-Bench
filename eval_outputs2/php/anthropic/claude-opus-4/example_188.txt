Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has nothing after the mock setup, while the other side adds a `tearDown` method that calls `parent::tearDown()` and `m::close()`.

The semantic intent here is that the incoming changes want to properly clean up Mockery mocks after each test by adding a tearDown method. This is a good testing practice to ensure mocks don't leak between tests.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```php
        $this->app->instance('Indatus\Dispatcher\Platform', m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Platform', function ($m) {
                    $m->shouldReceive('isUnix')->andReturn(true);
                    $m->shouldReceive('isWindows')->andReturn(false);
                    $m->shouldReceive('isHHVM')->andReturn(false);
                }));
    }

    public function tearDown()
    {
        parent::tearDown();
        m::close();
    }

    public function testRunDue()
    {
        $scheduledCommand = $this->mockCommand();

```
