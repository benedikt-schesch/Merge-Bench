Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Checks if `$permissionProperties !== ""`
- **Incoming change**: Checks if `is_assoc($permissionProperties) === true`

Given the context:
1. `$permissionProperties` is the result of `json_decode($openedPropertyPerm)`
2. The code then iterates over `$permissionProperties` as key-value pairs with `foreach`
3. The comment says "make sure permissions are set"

The semantic intent appears to be checking whether `$permissionProperties` contains valid permission data that can be iterated over. Since `json_decode()` returns `null` for invalid JSON and objects/arrays for valid JSON, and the foreach loop expects an associative array structure, the incoming change using `is_assoc()` seems more semantically correct.

However, since both checks are trying to ensure valid permission data exists, the most robust solution would be to check for a non-empty associative array.

```php
					//actual data
					$openedData = json_decode($openedData);
					$permissionProperties = json_decode($openedPropertyPerm);

					$isThere = false;
					if (is_array($permissionProperties) && !empty($permissionProperties)) {//make sure permissions are set

						$outputObj = array();
						//create obj for properties user is given access to.

						foreach ($permissionProperties as $propertyName => $propertyValue) {

```
