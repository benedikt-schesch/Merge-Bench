Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to ensure that `host` and `port` configuration values are set, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD** (left side): Uses a more explicit approach with `if` statements that only set the values if they are `null`
- **Right side**: Uses a ternary operator approach that sets the values if they're not already set (using `isset()`)

Both approaches achieve the same semantic intent - ensuring that `$this->cfg['host']` and `$this->cfg['port']` have values, using the provided `$host` and `$port` as defaults.

However, there's a subtle difference: the HEAD version only sets values when they are explicitly `null`, while the right side sets values when they're not set at all (undefined). The HEAD approach seems more precise and is already handling the `host` assignment earlier in the context.

Since the HEAD version is more consistent with the existing code pattern above it (which already handles the host assignment), I'll resolve in favor of HEAD:

```php
            }
            if ($this->cfg['port'] === null) {
                $this->cfg['port'] = $port;
            }
        }

        // choose appropriate transport
        // if 'bosh_url' cfg is defined include 0206
        if (isset($this->cfg['bosh_url'])) {
            JAXLLogger::debug("including bosh xep");

```
