Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version number conflict in what appears to be a PHP class constant definition. 

The conflict shows:
- HEAD (current branch) has version '1.7.2'
- The incoming branch has version '1.7.1'

Since version numbers should increment forward and 1.7.2 is higher than 1.7.1, the semantic intent here is to keep the higher version number. This is a common pattern in software development where different branches may have incremented the version, and we want to keep the most recent/highest version.

```php
	 * Plugin version, used for cache-busting of style and script file references.
	 *
	 * @since 1.7.0
	 * @type string
	 */
	const VERSION = '1.7.2';

	/**
	 * Initialize the plugin.
	 *
	 * @since 1.7.0

```
