Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - outputting a JSON error message that includes the `$otherUser` variable. The only difference is in the string concatenation syntax:

- HEAD uses PHP's dot (`.`) operator for string concatenation (which is correct for PHP)
- The other branch uses the plus (`+`) operator for string concatenation (which is incorrect for PHP - this is JavaScript syntax)

Since this is PHP code (evident from the `<?php` context and the use of `echo`, `$_POST`, etc.), the correct resolution is to use the dot operator for string concatenation.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
					}
				} else {
					echo '{"cenError":"email access not granted."}';
				}
			} else {
				echo '{"cenError":"user "' . $otherUser . '" does not exist."}';
			}

		} else if ($action === "setOther") {

			$otherUser = $_POST['otherUser'];

```
