Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version number conflict in what appears to be a Flarum application constant.

The HEAD branch has version `1.6.3` (a stable release version), while the incoming branch has version `1.7.0-dev` (a development version for the next release).

Based on semantic versioning principles and the typical flow of software development:
- `1.6.3` appears to be a patch release on the 1.6.x branch
- `1.7.0-dev` indicates active development on the next minor version

Since this appears to be a merge where the development branch (`1.7.0-dev`) is being merged into or compared with a stable release branch, the semantic intent would typically be to keep the development version, as it represents the forward progression of the codebase.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
    /**
     * The Flarum version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    const VERSION = '1.7.0-dev';

    /**
     * The IoC container for the Flarum application.
     *
     * @var Container

```
