Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to set a PHPUnit expected exception annotation, but they're expecting different types of PHP errors:

- HEAD expects a `PHPUnit_Framework_Error_Warning`
- The incoming change expects a `PHPUnit_Framework_Error_Notice`

Without knowing the actual behavior of the `JAXLXml` constructor when called with no arguments, I cannot determine which error type is correct. The semantic intent is clear - both sides want to test that some kind of PHP error is thrown - but the specific error level is in dispute.

Since I cannot determine the correct resolution without more context about what error the code actually generates, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php

    public static $NS = 'SOME_NAMESPACE';
    public static $attrs = array('attr1' => 'value1');

    /**
<<<<<<< HEAD:tests/JAXLXmlTest.php
     * @expectedException PHPUnit_Framework_Error_Warning
=======
     * @expectedException PHPUnit_Framework_Error_Notice
>>>>>>> 6c8615c992fb6938640ddfca299de55dc1012ed2:tests/test_jaxl_xml.php
     */
    public function testJAXLXml_0()
    {
        $xml = new JAXLXml();
        $this->assertEquals('<></>', $xml->to_string());

```
