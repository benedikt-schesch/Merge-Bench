Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the version information for the 'afragen/git-updater' package. The conflict appears to be between two different branch references:

- HEAD (current branch) is using the 'dev-develop' branch
- The incoming changes are using the 'dev-master' branch

Since this appears to be a semantic choice about which branch to track rather than a technical conflict, and without additional context about which branch should be the source of truth for this project, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The intent is ambiguous as both sides have valid version references, just pointing to different branches.

Here is the same snippet with the conflict preserved:

        'dev' => true,
    ),

        ),

```
