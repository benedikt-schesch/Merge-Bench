Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the Laravel framework version constant, but they're setting different version numbers:

- HEAD wants to set version to '12.14.0' (a major version 12)
- The other branch wants to set version to '11.44.7' (a major version 11)

Since HEAD is trying to set a higher major version (12.x) compared to the incoming change (11.x), and this appears to be a framework version constant that should reflect the actual Laravel version being used, the semantic intent seems to be that HEAD represents a more recent/upgraded version of the framework.

Here's the resolved conflict, keeping the higher version from HEAD:

```php
    /**
     * The Laravel framework version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    const VERSION = '12.14.0';

    /**
     * The base path for the Laravel installation.
     *
     * @var string

```
