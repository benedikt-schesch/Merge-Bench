Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD side (DateTime/Scheduler.php) is trying to add several `use` statements for Dispatcher-related classes
2. The other side (Cron/Scheduler.php) is trying to add a single `use App;` statement
3. Both sides want to keep the `use Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\Schedulable;` statement

Based on the semantic intent, both sides are adding necessary imports for their respective implementations. Since these are different files (DateTime/Scheduler.php vs Cron/Scheduler.php) that got merged, we should include all the use statements as they're likely all needed.

Here's the resolved code:

```php

use App;
use Indatus\Dispatcher\Day;
use Indatus\Dispatcher\Month;
use Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\BadScheduleException;
use Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\Schedulable;

class Scheduler extends Schedulable
{

```
