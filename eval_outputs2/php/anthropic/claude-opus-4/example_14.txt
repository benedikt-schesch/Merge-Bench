Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to display the number of subscribers, but with a slight difference:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Uses `(int)$Subscribers` to explicitly cast the value to an integer before formatting
- **Incoming change**: Uses `$Subscribers` directly without casting

The intent appears to be the same - to display the formatted number of subscribers. The HEAD version is being more defensive by ensuring the value is an integer before formatting, which is generally a good practice to avoid potential issues with non-numeric values.

Since the semantic intent is identical and the HEAD version includes additional type safety, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```php
			<ul class="stats nobullet">
				<li>Torrents: <?=number_format($NumGroups)?></li>
<? if (!empty($TopArtists)) { ?>
				<li>Artists: <?=number_format(count($TopArtists))?></li>
<? } ?>
				<li>Subscribers: <?=number_format((int)$Subscribers)?></li>
				<li>Built by <?=number_format(count($Users))?> user<?=(count($Users) > 1 ? 's' : '')?></li>
				<li>Last updated: <?=time_diff($Updated)?></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="box box_tags">

```
