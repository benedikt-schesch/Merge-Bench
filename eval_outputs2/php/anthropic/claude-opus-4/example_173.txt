Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD (current branch) is trying to add a class property `$configResolver` and implement a `setUp()` method that initializes this property
- The incoming change (8a08444b80) is trying to add a `tearDown()` method

Both changes appear to be complementary rather than conflicting in intent. The setUp() method initializes the test environment, while tearDown() would clean it up. Both are standard test lifecycle methods.

However, I notice an issue: the incoming change has `parent::setUp();` inside the `tearDown()` method, which is incorrect - it should be `parent::tearDown();`.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```php
use Config;
use TestCase;

class TestConfigResolver extends TestCase
{
    /** @var ConfigResolver */
    protected $configResolver;

    public function setUp()
    {
        parent::setUp();
        $this->configResolver = App::make('Indatus\Dispatcher\ConfigResolver');
    }

    public function tearDown()
    {
        parent::tearDown();
    }


```

Wait, I need to reconsider. Looking more carefully at the conflict, the incoming change has the `parent::setUp()` call inside what's labeled as `tearDown()`, which seems like a mistake. Given this ambiguity and the fact that the code seems incorrect, I should return the conflict as-is:

```php
use Config;
use TestCase;

class TestConfigResolver extends TestCase
{
<<<<<<< HEAD
    /** @var ConfigResolver */
    protected $configResolver;

    public function setUp()
=======
    public function tearDown()
>>>>>>> 8a08444b80550a21aa79eb24c96872111fe9cd01
    {
        parent::setUp();
        $this->configResolver = App::make('Indatus\Dispatcher\ConfigResolver');
    }


```
