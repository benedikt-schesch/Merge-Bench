Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add the same parameter `(bool)$args->getOption('skip-plugins')` to the `loadAll()` method call. The only difference is that HEAD doesn't have a trailing comma while the other branch does.

Since both sides have the same intent (adding the skip-plugins option), and the trailing comma is generally considered good practice in PHP for multi-line function calls as it makes future additions easier, I'll resolve this by keeping the version with the trailing comma:

```php
    public function execute(Arguments $args, ConsoleIo $io): int
    {
        $configFinder = new ConfigFinder();
        $config = $configFinder->loadAll(
            (string)$args->getOption('config'),
            (bool)$args->getOption('skip-plugins'),
        );
        $factory = new Factory($config);

        $themes = (array)$config->general('themes');
        foreach ($themes as $theme) {

```
