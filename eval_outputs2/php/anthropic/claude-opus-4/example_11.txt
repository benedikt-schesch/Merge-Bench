Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what's happening with the `cptui_admin_notices_helper` function call.

The conflict shows:
- HEAD version: Has two parameters - the message and `false`
- Other branch: Has only one parameter - just the message

Both sides have the same message text, so the conflict is only about whether to include the second parameter (`false`).

Without more context about what `cptui_admin_notices_helper` expects or what changes were made to its signature, I cannot determine which version is correct. The intent is ambiguous - one branch may have updated the function to require a second parameter, or the other branch may have simplified it to use a default value.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php
 *
 * @since 1.5.0
 */
function cptui_import_fail_admin_notice() {
	echo cptui_admin_notices_helper(
<<<<<<< HEAD
		esc_html__( 'Invalid data provided', 'custom-post-type-ui' ),
		false
=======
		esc_html__( 'Invalid data provided', 'custom-post-type-ui' )
>>>>>>> 87a406bda6b64d7103e4334a33c192b715bca89f
	);
}

/**
 * Returns error message for if trying to register existing post type.
