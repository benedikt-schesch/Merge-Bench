Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that these are two completely different test files that have been conflated in the merge:

1. HEAD side: `tests/Phake/Annotation/MockInitializerTypedPropertiesTest.php` - appears to be testing a MockInitializer
2. Other side: `tests/Phake/Matchers/PHPUnit6ConstraintAdapterTest.php` - appears to be testing a PHPUnit6ConstraintAdapter

These are semantically unrelated pieces of code that belong to different test classes. The conflict appears to be a result of a file rename or reorganization where Git is trying to merge content from two different test files.

Since these are completely different test implementations with different purposes, I cannot semantically merge them into a single coherent implementation. The conflict needs to be resolved by choosing which test file this actually should be, or by separating them into their proper files.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php
    #[Mock]
    private AnotherNamespacedClass $nativeMock;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
<<<<<<< HEAD:tests/Phake/Annotation/MockInitializerTypedPropertiesTest.php
        $this->initializer = new MockInitializer();
=======
        $this->constraint = $this->getMockBuilder(Constraint::class)->getMock();
        $this->adapter    = new PHPUnit6ConstraintAdapter($this->constraint);
        $this->constraint->expects($this->any())
            ->method('toString')
            ->willReturn('phpunit matcher');
>>>>>>> 78e410ae3ae8d3249e757e46cbab122d33af879e:tests/Phake/Matchers/PHPUnit6ConstraintAdapterTest.php
    }

    public function testInitialize(): void
    {
<<<<<<< HEAD:tests/Phake/Annotation/MockInitializerTypedPropertiesTest.php

```
