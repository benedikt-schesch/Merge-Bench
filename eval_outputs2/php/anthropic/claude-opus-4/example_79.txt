Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the `$supportedDrivers` property, but with different values:

- HEAD (current branch): supports only `['mysql', 'pgsql']`
- Incoming branch: supports `['mysql', 'pgsql', 'sqlite']`

The semantic intent appears to be adding SQLite support to the list of supported database drivers. The incoming branch is extending the functionality by adding 'sqlite' to the existing drivers, which is a common pattern when expanding database support.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```php

use Drupal\Core\Database\Database;

trait ConnectTrait
{
    protected $supportedDrivers = ['mysql', 'pgsql', 'sqlite'];

    public function resolveConnection($key = 'default', $target = 'default')
    {
        $connectionInfo = Database::getConnectionInfo($key);

```
