Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has no `tearDown` method, while the other side (8a08444b80550a21aa79eb24c96872111fe9cd01) adds a `tearDown` method that calls `parent::tearDown()` and `m::close()`.

The `tearDown` method appears to be for cleaning up after tests, specifically closing Mockery (indicated by `m::close()`). This is a common pattern in PHPUnit tests when using Mockery for mocking. Since this doesn't conflict with any existing functionality and is a standard testing practice, the semantic intent is clear: ensure proper cleanup after each test.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
use Config;
use TestCase;

class TestConfig extends TestCase
{
    public function tearDown()
    {
        parent::tearDown();
        m::close();
    }

    public function testDefaultDriver()
    {
        $this->assertEquals(Config::get('dispatcher::driver'), 'dateTime');
    }


```
