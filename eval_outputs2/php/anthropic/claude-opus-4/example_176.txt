Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has nothing after the author comment, while the other side adds a `use` statement for the Indatus\Dispatcher\ServiceProvider class.

Since this appears to be a test file for a ServiceProvider (based on the class name `TestServiceProvider`), it makes semantic sense to include the use statement for the ServiceProvider class that's being tested. The intent seems to be adding necessary imports for the test class.

```php

/**
 * @author Ben Kuhl <bkuhl@indatus.com>
 */

use Indatus\Dispatcher\ServiceProvider;
use Mockery as m;
use TestCase;

class TestServiceProvider extends TestCase
{

```
