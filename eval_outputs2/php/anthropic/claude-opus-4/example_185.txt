Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to bind the same service (`Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService`) but with a slight difference:

- The HEAD version uses `$this->app->bind()` and includes a closing brace `}` for what appears to be a method
- The incoming changes use `App::bind()` and don't have the closing brace

Since both sides have the same intent (binding the ScheduleService), and the HEAD version appears to be more complete with proper method closure and uses the more appropriate `$this->app->bind()` syntax (which is the standard practice in Laravel service providers), I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```php
>>>>>>> 8a08444b80550a21aa79eb24c96872111fe9cd01
            return $resolver->resolveSchedulerClass();
        });

        //load the schedule service of the appropriate driver
        $this->app->bind('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService', function () use ($resolver) {
            return $resolver->resolveServiceClass();
        });
    }

    /**
     * Register the service provider.
     *
     * @codeCoverageIgnore

```
