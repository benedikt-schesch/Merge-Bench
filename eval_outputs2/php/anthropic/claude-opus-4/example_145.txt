Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - creating database columns for what appears to be a nested set model (with left, right, and parent_id columns).

The key differences are:
- HEAD uses `self::` to reference the constants and adds `->default(0)` to the LFT and RGT columns
- The other branch uses `static::` to reference the constants and doesn't set default values

Since both sides are semantically trying to achieve the same thing, and the code below the conflict uses `static::` (in `$table->index(static::getDefaultColumns());`), I'll resolve this by:
1. Using `static::` for consistency with the rest of the codebase
2. Including the `->default(0)` from HEAD as it provides a sensible default for the nested set columns

Here's the resolved code:

```php
     *
     * @param \Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint $table
     */
    public static function columns(Blueprint $table)
    {
        $table->unsignedInteger(static::LFT)->default(0);
        $table->unsignedInteger(static::RGT)->default(0);
        $table->unsignedInteger(static::PARENT_ID)->nullable();

        $table->index(static::getDefaultColumns());
    }
