Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version has an empty line between the `use` statements and the `use function` statement, while the incoming change (aa1f9bf2617c9863f2286595403f7dbffe2786ea) has no empty line between them.

This is a formatting/style conflict. Both versions are syntactically valid PHP code. The semantic intent is the same - both versions want to import the same classes and functions. The only difference is the presence or absence of a blank line.

Since this is purely a stylistic difference with no semantic impact, I'll preserve the conflict as-is to let the developer decide based on their project's coding standards:

```php
use DateTimeImmutable;
use DateTimeInterface;
use InvalidArgumentException;
use Stringable;
use Throwable;
<<<<<<< HEAD

use const FILTER_VALIDATE_INT;
