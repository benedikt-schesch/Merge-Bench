Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Checks if `$this->bgimg != ''` OR `imagecreatetruecolor` function exists to decide whether to use `imagecreatetruecolor`
- **Incoming change**: Adds an additional condition `$this->use_transparent_text == true` to the same check

The semantic intent is clear: both sides want to determine when to use `imagecreatetruecolor` vs `imagecreate`. The incoming change is adding a new condition (transparent text support) that would also require the true color image functions.

The resolution should include all three conditions since they each represent a valid reason to use `imagecreatetruecolor`:
1. When transparent text is needed (`$this->use_transparent_text == true`)
2. When a background image is specified (`$this->bgimg != ''`)
3. When the function is available (`function_exists('imagecreatetruecolor')`)

Here's the resolved code:

```php
    /**
     * The main image drawing routing, responsible for constructing the entire image and serving it
     */
    protected function doImage()
    {
        if($this->use_transparent_text == true || $this->bgimg != '' || function_exists('imagecreatetruecolor')) {
            $imagecreate = 'imagecreatetruecolor';
        } else {
            $imagecreate = 'imagecreate';
        }
