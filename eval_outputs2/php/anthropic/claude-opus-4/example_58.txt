Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same file that has been moved/renamed. The key differences are:

1. **File path**: `vendors/media/video.php` vs `vendors/medium/video.php`
2. **Subpackage**: `media.libs.media` vs `media.libs.medium`
3. **Copyright year**: `2007-2009` vs `2007-2010`

Based on the semantic intent, it appears that:
- HEAD is using the older structure with `media/video.php` and `media.libs.media`
- The incoming change has restructured to use `medium/video.php` and `media.libs.medium`, and also updated the copyright year

Since the incoming change appears to be a more recent refactoring (indicated by the newer copyright year and the structural change from `media` to `medium`), the semantic intent seems to be accepting the newer structure.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.libs.medium
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
 * @license    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php The MIT License
 * @link       http://github.com/davidpersson/media
 */
App::import('Vendor', 'Media.Media');
