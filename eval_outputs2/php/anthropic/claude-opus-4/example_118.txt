Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is adding three additional `use` statements:
- `Illuminate\Foundation\Application`
- `Illuminate\Support\Str`
- `InvalidArgumentException`

The other branch (5e4cb54) doesn't have these imports. Since these are just import statements and don't conflict with anything else, the semantic intent appears to be that the HEAD branch needs these additional classes for some functionality. The safest resolution is to keep all the imports.

Here's the resolved code:

```php

use Illuminate\Foundation\AliasLoader;
use Collective\Html\FormBuilder as LaravelForm;
use Collective\Html\HtmlBuilder;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use InvalidArgumentException;
use Kris\LaravelFormBuilder\Traits\ValidatesWhenResolved;
use Kris\LaravelFormBuilder\Form;

class FormBuilderServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{

```
