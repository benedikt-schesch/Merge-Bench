Looking at this merge conflict, I can see two differences between the versions:

1. **Comparison operator**: `===` (HEAD) vs `==` (incoming change)
2. **Text domain**: `'custom-post-type-ui'` (HEAD) vs `'custom_post_type_ui'` (incoming change)

The semantic intent appears to be checking if we're in edit mode and displaying an appropriate message. The HEAD version uses strict comparison (`===`) which is generally preferred in PHP for type safety. The text domain difference is notable - the HEAD version uses hyphens while the incoming version uses underscores.

Looking at the context, the line immediately after the conflict uses `'custom-post-type-ui'` as the text domain, which suggests the HEAD version is consistent with the surrounding code.

Here's the resolved version maintaining consistency with the surrounding code:

```php
						<?php
						echo $ui->get_tr_start() . $ui->get_th_start();
						echo $ui->get_label( 'name', esc_html__( 'Post Type Slug', 'custom-post-type-ui' ) );
						echo $ui->get_required_span();

						if ( 'edit' === $tab ) {
							echo '<p id="slugchanged" class="hidemessage">' . esc_html__( 'Slug has changed', 'custom-post-type-ui' ) . '</p>';
						}
						echo '<p id="slugexists" class="hidemessage">' . esc_html__( 'Slug already exists', 'custom-post-type-ui' ) . '</p>';

						echo $ui->get_th_end() . $ui->get_td_start();
