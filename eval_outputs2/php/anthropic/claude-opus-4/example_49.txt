Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the code, with the following differences:

1. **File path**: HEAD has `vendors/media/adapter/imagick.php` while the other branch has `vendors/medium/adapter/imagick.php`
2. **Subpackage**: HEAD has `media.libs.media.adapter` while the other branch has `media.libs.medium.adapter`
3. **Copyright year**: HEAD has `2007-2009` while the other branch has `2007-2010`

Based on the commit hash and the changes, it appears the other branch (1922e0642...) is trying to:
- Update the copyright year to 2010 (which is likely the more recent change)
- Rename from "media" to "medium" in the path and subpackage

Since both changes appear intentional and the second branch seems to be a more recent update (2010 vs 2009), I'll resolve by accepting the changes from the second branch:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.libs.medium.adapter
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
 * @license    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php The MIT License
