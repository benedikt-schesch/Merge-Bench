Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch added PHPDoc annotations including `@dataProvider classProvider` and a `@param` tag, while the other branch kept the method without these additions.

Since the test method name is `testItShouldRemoveExpiredToken` and there's a reference to `@dataProvider classProvider`, it appears the HEAD branch was trying to parameterize this test to work with multiple classes. This is a common pattern in PHPUnit for testing the same functionality across different implementations.

The semantic intent seems to be enhancing the test to support multiple classes via a data provider. I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD changes as they represent an enhancement to the test:

```php
>>>>>>> a038aa7f258cb0c05cc8ba6943afd9733b9a89df
    }

    /**
     * Delete expired tokens for provided classes.
     *
     * @dataProvider classProvider
     *
     * @param string $class a fully qualified class name
     */
    public function testItShouldRemoveExpiredToken()
    {
        $expiredAccessTokens = 5;
        $this->accessTokenManager

```
