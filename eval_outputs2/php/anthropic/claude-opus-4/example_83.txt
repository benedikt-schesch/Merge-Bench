Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the same constants but with different approaches:

- HEAD (left side): Uses uppercase constant names (`VERSION`, `NAME`) and version 3.0.2
- Incoming change (right side): Uses lowercase constant names (`version`, `name`) and version 3.0.3

In PHP, class constants traditionally use uppercase naming convention (PSR-1 standard). The incoming change appears to be updating the version number from 3.0.2 to 3.0.3, but incorrectly changed the constant names to lowercase.

The semantic intent seems to be updating the version number while maintaining proper PHP constant naming conventions. Here's the resolved conflict:

```php
 */
class JAXL extends XMPPStream
{
    
    // lib meta info
    const VERSION = '3.0.3';
    const NAME = 'JAXL :: Jabber XMPP Library';
    
    // cached init config array
    public $cfg = array();
    


```
