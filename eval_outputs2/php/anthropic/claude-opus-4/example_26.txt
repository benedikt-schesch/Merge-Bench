Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to improve the code, but in different ways:

- **HEAD**: Executes the query again with `mysql_query($sql)` inside `mysql_fetch_array()`
- **cb907c1**: Uses the already executed query result `$query` and adds error handling with `or die()`

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Execute the SQL query
2. Fetch the result array
3. Handle potential errors

Since `$query` already contains the result of `mysql_query($sql)` from line 5, re-executing the query (as HEAD does) is redundant and inefficient. The second version (cb907c1) correctly reuses the query result and adds error handling, which is the better approach.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```php

	$offset = ($page-1)*QUESTIONS_PER_PAGE;

	$sql = ("select count(questions.id) count from questions $conditionspre WHERE $conditionspost 1");
	$query = mysql_query($sql);
	$result = mysql_fetch_array($query) or die("Query to get blah failed with error: ".mysql_error());

	$template->set('questionscount',$result['count']);

	$paging = new Pagination();
	$paging->set('urlscheme','?order='.$orderby.$tag.$type.$search.'&page=%page%');
	$paging->set('perpage',QUESTIONS_PER_PAGE);

```
