Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

**HEAD (left side):**
- Makes a call with `true` as the second parameter
- Always passes the count parameter, even when `$limit` is 0

**Right side:**
- Makes a call with `false` as the second parameter
- Only includes the count parameter when `$limit > 0`

The semantic differences are:
1. The boolean parameter (true vs false) - this appears to be the critical difference
2. Whether to conditionally include the count parameter

Without more context about what the second parameter of `_makeCall` represents, I cannot determine which boolean value is correct. This is a case where the intent is ambiguous, so I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php
   * @param integer [optional] $limit     Limit of returned results
   *
   * @return mixed
   */
  public function getTagMedia($name, $limit = 0) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return $this->_makeCall('tags/' . $name . '/media/recent', true, array('count' => $limit));
=======
    $params = array();
    if ($limit > 0) {
      $params['count'] = $limit;
    }
    return $this->_makeCall('tags/' . $name . '/media/recent', false, $params);
