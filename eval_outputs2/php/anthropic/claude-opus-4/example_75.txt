Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version constant conflict in what appears to be a Flarum application file.

The conflict shows:
- HEAD (current branch): `const VERSION = '1.7.0-dev';`
- Incoming change: `const VERSION = '1.6.2';`

Based on semantic versioning and typical development workflows:
- The HEAD version `1.7.0-dev` is a development version for the next minor release
- The incoming version `1.6.2` is a patch release of the 1.6.x line

The most likely scenario is that someone released version 1.6.2 (a patch/bugfix release) while development continues on 1.7.0. In this case, the development branch should keep the higher version number `1.7.0-dev` since it represents ongoing work for the next minor version.

```php
    /**
     * The Flarum version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    const VERSION = '1.7.0-dev';

    /**
     * The IoC container for the Flarum application.
     *
     * @var Container
```
