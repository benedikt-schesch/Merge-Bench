Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - displaying a warning message when unable to automatically add API route definition. The differences are:

1. **HEAD version**: Uses string interpolation with the `$appBootstrapPath` variable to show which specific file couldn't be modified, and includes a `return` statement.
2. **Incoming version**: Uses a more generic message without specifying the file path.

The HEAD version provides more specific information to the user (showing the actual path) and includes the `return` statement which is likely important for the control flow. This makes it the semantically better choice.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
                'web: __DIR__.\'/../routes/web.php\',',
                'web: __DIR__.\'/../routes/web.php\','.PHP_EOL.'        api: __DIR__.\'/../routes/api.php\',',
                $appBootstrapPath,
            );
        } else {
            $this->components->warn("Unable to automatically add API route definition to [{$appBootstrapPath}]. API route file should be registered manually.");

            return;
        }
    }

    /**
