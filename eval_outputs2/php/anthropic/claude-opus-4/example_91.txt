Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import the same two classes (`Carbon\Translator` and `Jenssegers\Date\Date`), just in different orders. Since this is merely a difference in import order and both sides have the same intent (importing both classes), I'll resolve this by keeping one consistent order.

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Jenssegers;

use Carbon\Translator;
use Jenssegers\Date\Date;
use Symfony\Component\Translation\Loader\ArrayLoader;

class TranslationHuTest extends TestCaseBase
{
    const LOCALE = 'hu';

```
