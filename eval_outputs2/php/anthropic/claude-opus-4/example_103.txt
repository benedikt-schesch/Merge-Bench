Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are adding different variable documentation to the PHPDoc comment block. The HEAD side is adding documentation for `$phpVersion` and `$overwrittenTemplateFiles`, while the other branch is adding documentation for `$isAllReady`.

Since these are non-conflicting additions (they're documenting different variables), the semantic intent is to include both sets of documentation. Here's the resolved version:

```php
/**
 * @var array $jigoshop All Jigoshop plugins.
 * @var array $rest Other plugins.
 * @var string $errors
 * @var string $info
 * @var string $phpVersion
 * @var array $overwrittenTemplateFiles
 * @var bool $isAllReady true when all client plugins is stable and ready for JS2
 */
