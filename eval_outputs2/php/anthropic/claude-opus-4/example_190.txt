Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Uses `'Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService'`
- **Incoming change**: Uses `'Indatus\Dispatcher\Drivers\Cron\ScheduleService'`

The key observation is that both sides are trying to mock the same service, but the incoming change appears to be refactoring the namespace from `Services` to `Drivers\Cron`. This looks like a typical refactoring where the ScheduleService has been moved to a more specific location within the codebase.

The critical part is the line after the conflict:
```php
$this->app->instance('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService', $scheduleService);
```

This line is binding the mock to the container using the old namespace. If we accept the incoming change (using the new namespace for the mock), we should also update this binding to maintain consistency.

Since the incoming change appears to be a deliberate refactoring to move the ScheduleService to a more specific driver-based location, and to maintain consistency throughout the test, I'll resolve this by accepting the incoming change:

```php
            function ($m) use ($scheduledCommand, $scheduler) {
                $item = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\QueueItem');
                $item->shouldReceive('getCommand')->once()->andReturn($scheduledCommand);
                $m->shouldReceive('flush')->once()->andReturn([$item]);
            });
        $scheduleService = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Drivers\Cron\ScheduleService');
        $scheduleService->shouldReceive('getQueue')->once()->andReturn($queue);
        $this->app->instance('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService', $scheduleService);

        $commandService = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\CommandService[runnableInCurrentMaintenanceSetting,run]',
            [$scheduleService],

```
