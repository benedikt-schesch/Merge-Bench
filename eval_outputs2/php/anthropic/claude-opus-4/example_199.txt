Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the method signature, specifically the `$constructorArgs` parameter and the return type.

**HEAD (left side):**
- Has `array $constructorArgs = null` (without nullable type)
- Has explicit return type `: IMock`

**Other branch (right side):**
- Has `?array $constructorArgs = null` (with nullable type syntax)
- No return type specified

From a semantic perspective, both sides appear to agree that `$constructorArgs` should be nullable with a default value of `null`. The modern PHP way to express this is with the nullable type syntax (`?array`), which the right side uses. The left side achieves the same effect but with older syntax.

The left side also adds a return type declaration (`: IMock`), which is a good practice for type safety.

The resolution should combine both improvements: use the modern nullable type syntax from the right side AND keep the return type declaration from the left side.

```php
    public function mock(
        string|array $mockedClassList,
        ClassGenerator\MockClass $mockGenerator,
        CallRecorder\Recorder $callRecorder,
        Stubber\IAnswer $defaultAnswer,
        ?array $constructorArgs = null
    ): IMock {
        $mockedClassList = (array) $mockedClassList;

        foreach ($mockedClassList as $mockedClass) {
            if (!class_exists($mockedClass, true) && !interface_exists($mockedClass, true)) {
                throw new \InvalidArgumentException("The class / interface [{$mockedClass}] does not exist. Check the spelling and make sure it is loadable.");
