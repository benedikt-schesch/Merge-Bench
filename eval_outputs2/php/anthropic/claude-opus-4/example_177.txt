Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar goals but with different approaches:

**HEAD side:**
- Uses `$this->app->make()` (dependency injection approach)
- Uses `ReflectionException` without namespace
- Uses `$this->getDriver()` consistently

**Other side:**
- Uses `App::make()` (facade approach)
- Uses `\ReflectionException` with namespace
- Uses `Config::get('dispatcher::driver')` in the first attempt, then falls back to `$this->getDriver()`

The semantic intent of both sides is to:
1. Try to resolve a Scheduler class using a driver configuration
2. If that fails due to a ReflectionException, fall back to a namespaced version under `Indatus\Dispatcher\Drivers\`

The most consistent and semantically correct resolution would be to:
- Use `$this->app->make()` for consistency with dependency injection patterns
- Use `\ReflectionException` with proper namespace
- Use `$this->getDriver()` consistently in both attempts

Here's the resolved code:

```php
     * @return \Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\Schedulable
     */
    public function resolveSchedulerClass()
    {
        try {
            return $this->app->make($this->getDriver().'\\Scheduler', [$this]);
        } catch (\ReflectionException $e) {
            return $this->app->make('Indatus\Dispatcher\Drivers\\'.$this->getDriver().'\\Scheduler', [$this]);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Resolve a class based on the driver configuration

```
