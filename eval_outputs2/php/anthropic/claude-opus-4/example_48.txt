Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the copyright year and there's a slight difference in the subpackage path. The HEAD branch shows changes from 2007-2009 while the incoming branch shows 2007-2010, and the subpackage paths differ (`media.libs.media` vs `media.libs.medium`).

Since the incoming branch has a more recent copyright year (2010) and appears to be a rename/refactoring of the path from `media` to `medium`, the semantic intent seems to be to update both the copyright year and the subpackage path.

Here's the resolved version:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.libs.medium
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
 * @license    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php The MIT License
 * @link       http://github.com/davidpersson/media
 */
App::import('Vendor', 'Media.Media');
