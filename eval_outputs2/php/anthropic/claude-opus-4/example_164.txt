Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD (current branch) has a class that extends `LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase`
- The incoming branch (5a4e0153f45d48bdd45683584367d53a9ff4fa05) has the same class but without extending any base class

Without more context about the intent of both changes, I cannot determine which approach is correct. The conflict could represent:
1. An intentional removal of the base class inheritance
2. An intentional addition of the base class inheritance
3. Changes made in parallel where one branch added inheritance while another didn't

Since the intent is ambiguous, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```php

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

<<<<<<< HEAD
class LaravelLocalizationRedirectFilter extends LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase {

=======
class LaravelLocalizationRedirectFilter
{
>>>>>>> 5a4e0153f45d48bdd45683584367d53a9ff4fa05
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param \Illuminate\Http\Request $request
     * @param \Closure                 $next

```
