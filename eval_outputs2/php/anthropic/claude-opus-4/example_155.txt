Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

**HEAD side**: Checks if `$openedData` is an empty string and sets it to an empty array if so.

**Other branch**: Checks if `$openedData` is not an associative array and sets it to an empty JSON object by creating a string `"{}"` and then decoding it.

Both sides appear to be handling the case where `$openedData` might not be in the expected format after JSON decoding. The semantic intent is to ensure `$openedData` is a valid data structure that can be worked with.

Since `json_decode()` returns `null` when decoding fails (not an empty string), and the other branch's approach of checking for an associative array is more robust, I'll resolve this by combining the intent of both - checking for proper data structure and initializing appropriately:

```php
		} else if ($action === "update") {

			$openedData = openFile("$directory/$groupName/$userName/data.txt", 500000);
			$openedData = json_decode($openedData);
			
			if (!is_array($openedData) && !is_object($openedData)) {
				$openedData = array();
			}

			$clientData = json_decode($clientData);

			$outputData = array();

```
