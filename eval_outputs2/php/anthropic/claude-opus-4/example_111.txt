Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the `$supportedDrivers` array, but with slightly different approaches:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Uses PHP 5.4+ short array syntax `['orm', 'mongodb', 'propel']` and includes 3 drivers
- **Incoming branch**: Uses older array syntax `array('orm', 'mongodb', 'propel', 'custom')` and includes 4 drivers (adds 'custom')

The semantic intent appears to be adding 'custom' as a supported driver option. The validation logic below also references 'custom' (`if ('custom' !== $v['db_driver'])`), which suggests that 'custom' should indeed be included in the supported drivers list.

The resolution should include all 4 drivers and use consistent array syntax. Since HEAD uses the modern short array syntax, I'll maintain that style:

```php
        $treeBuilder = new TreeBuilder();

        /** @var ArrayNodeDefinition $rootNode */
        $rootNode = $treeBuilder->root('fos_oauth_server');

        $supportedDrivers = ['orm', 'mongodb', 'propel', 'custom'];

        $rootNode
            ->validate()
                ->always(function($v) {
                    if ('custom' !== $v['db_driver']) {

```
