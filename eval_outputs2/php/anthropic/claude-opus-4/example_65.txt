Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same file that has been moved/renamed. The conflict shows:

1. HEAD: The file is at `vendors/media/adapter/gd.php` with subpackage `media.libs.media.adapter` and copyright years `2007-2009`
2. The incoming change: The file is at `vendors/medium/adapter/gd.php` with subpackage `media.libs.medium.adapter` and copyright years `2007-2010`

The intent appears to be:
- The file/package was renamed from `media` to `medium`
- The copyright year was updated to include 2010

Since the incoming change has the more recent copyright date and what appears to be the intended new naming convention (`medium` instead of `media`), I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.libs.medium.adapter
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
