Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Uses `ltrim(parse_url(\Request::path(), PHP_URL_PATH), '/')` to get the request path and trim leading slashes
- **Incoming change**: Simply uses `\Request::path()` without the parse_url and ltrim operations

The key insight is that in the context, we can see that `$path` is being processed with `ltrim(parse_url(...), '/')` to ensure consistency in path handling. The HEAD version maintains this consistency by applying the same processing to the request path, while the incoming change doesn't.

Since the code appears to be comparing paths (`$path` and `$rpath`), they should be processed in the same way to ensure accurate comparison. The HEAD version is semantically correct as it ensures both paths are processed consistently.

Here's the resolved version:

```php
	public function checkActivationStatus(){

		if( $this->builder->conf['restful'] == true ) {

			$path  = ltrim(parse_url($this->url(), PHP_URL_PATH), '/');
			$rpath = ltrim(parse_url(\Request::path(), PHP_URL_PATH), '/');
			

			if($this->builder->conf['rest_base'] ) {

				$base = ( is_array($this->builder->conf['rest_base']) ) ? implode('|', $this->builder->conf['rest_base']) : $this->builder->conf['rest_base'];


```
