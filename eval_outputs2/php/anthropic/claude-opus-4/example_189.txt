Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to mock the same service, but they're using different namespaces:

- HEAD uses: `Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService`
- The incoming change uses: `Indatus\Dispatcher\Drivers\Cron\ScheduleService`

The key insight is that later in the code, there's an `app->instance()` call that registers the mock with the namespace `'Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService'`. This suggests that the HEAD version is the correct one to maintain consistency.

Additionally, this appears to be a refactoring where the `ScheduleService` was moved from the `Services` namespace to the `Drivers\Cron` namespace. Since the registration still uses the old namespace, we should keep the HEAD version to ensure the mock is properly registered and the test works correctly.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
            function ($m) use ($scheduledCommand, $scheduler) {
                $item = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\QueueItem');
                $item->shouldReceive('getCommand')->once()->andReturn($scheduledCommand);
                $m->shouldReceive('flush')->once()->andReturn([$item]);
            });
        $scheduleService = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService');
        $scheduleService->shouldReceive('getQueue')->once()->andReturn($queue);
        $this->app->instance('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService', $scheduleService);

        $commandService = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\CommandService[runnableInEnvironment,run]',
            [$scheduleService]);

```
