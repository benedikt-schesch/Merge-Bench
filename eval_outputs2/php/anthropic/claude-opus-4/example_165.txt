Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD version: The class extends `LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase` and has an opening brace on the same line
- Other version: The class doesn't extend anything and has the opening brace on a new line

Based on the context (this is a middleware class in a Laravel localization package), it's most likely that the class should extend a base middleware class. The HEAD version appears to be adding inheritance from a base class, which is a common pattern for middleware that share common functionality.

Here's the resolved conflict, preserving the inheritance from the HEAD version:

```php
namespace Mcamara\LaravelLocalization\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class LaravelLocalizationRoutes extends LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase {

    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param \Illuminate\Http\Request $request
     * @param \Closure                 $next

```
