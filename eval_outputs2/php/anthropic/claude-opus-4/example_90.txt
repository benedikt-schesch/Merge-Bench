Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to document the type of the `$transport` parameter, but with different type hints:

- HEAD branch: `JAXLClientBase $transport`
- The other branch: `JAXLSocketClient|XEP_0206 $transport`

The conflict also shows that the file was moved/renamed:
- HEAD: `src/JAXL/xmpp/xmpp_stream.php`
- Other branch: `xmpp/xmpp_stream.php`

Without more context about the codebase architecture and which types are correct or current, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The intent is unclear - it could be that:
1. `JAXLClientBase` is a base class that both `JAXLSocketClient` and `XEP_0206` inherit from
2. The types were refactored and one side has outdated information
3. Both are valid but represent different architectural decisions

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict intact:

```php
    //
    // public api
    //

    /**
<<<<<<< HEAD:src/JAXL/xmpp/xmpp_stream.php
     * @param JAXLClientBase $transport

     * @param XMPPJid|null $jid
     * @param string $pass
     * @param string $resource
     * @param bool $force_tls
