Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they both want to check if a string value matches a factory pattern and return the captured group if it does.

The only difference between the two versions is the code style:
- HEAD version uses same-line opening brace (more common in modern PHP)
- The other version uses next-line opening brace

Since both versions have identical logic and the same-line brace style is more consistent with modern PHP coding standards, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```php
     * @param  string $value
     * @return mixed
     */
    protected function hasRelationshipAttribute($value)
    {
        if (is_string($value) && preg_match('/^factory:(.+)$/i', $value, $matches)) {
            return $matches[1];
        }

        return false;
    }

```
