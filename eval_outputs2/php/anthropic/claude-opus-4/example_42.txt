Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same file that has been moved/renamed. The conflict shows:

1. **HEAD**: The file is at `vendors/media/audio.php` with subpackage `media.libs.media` and copyright `2007-2009`
2. **Incoming**: The file is at `vendors/medium/audio.php` with subpackage `media.libs.medium` and copyright `2007-2010`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- The incoming changes want to rename the directory from `media` to `medium` 
- The incoming changes want to update the copyright year to include 2010
- Both versions maintain the same author and license

Since the incoming changes appear to be a more recent update (2010 vs 2009) and include what seems to be an intentional refactoring (media â†’ medium), I'll resolve in favor of the incoming changes:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.libs.medium
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
 * @license    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php The MIT License
 * @link       http://github.com/davidpersson/media
 */
App::import('Vendor', 'Media.Media');
