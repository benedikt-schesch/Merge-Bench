Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to document the same method `setSchedule`, but with different approaches:

- The HEAD version has more specific type hints (`int|array` for most parameters, `string|int|array` for `$week`) and includes documentation for the `$week` parameter
- The other branch uses generic `mixed` type hints for all parameters and doesn't include the `$week` parameter in the documentation

Since the actual method signature includes the `$week` parameter with a default value, and the HEAD version provides more specific and complete documentation, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```php
     * @param int|array        $dayOfMonth
     * @param int|array        $month
     * @param int|array        $dayOfWeek
     * @param string|int|array $week
     *
     * @return $this
     */
    public function setSchedule($minute, $hour, $dayOfMonth, $month, $dayOfWeek, $week = self::NONE)
    {
        $month = $this->parseTimeParameter($month);

```
