Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has removed the `use Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\ScheduledCommand;` import statement, while the other side (8a08444) has kept it.

Since the code still includes `use Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\ScheduledCommandInterface;` and we have a `BackgroundProcessRunner` class, I need to consider whether the `ScheduledCommand` import is actually needed.

Without seeing the rest of the class implementation, I cannot definitively determine if `ScheduledCommand` is used. The safest approach is to keep both imports to avoid potential errors.

Here's the resolved code:

```php

use Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\ScheduledCommand;
use Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\ScheduledCommandInterface;
use Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\CommandService;

class BackgroundProcessRunner
{

```
