Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they both want to set a hash value in Redis using `hset`. The only difference is the indentation:

- HEAD version uses a tab character for indentation
- The other branch uses spaces for indentation

Since the semantic intent is identical (both sides want to execute the same `hset` operation with the same parameters), I'll resolve this by keeping the version with spaces to maintain consistency with the surrounding code, which appears to use spaces for indentation.

```php
		
        $this -> redis -> lpush("razor_clientdata", serialize($data));
        
		//For realtime User sessions
        $key = "razor_r_u_p_" . $productId . "_" . date('Y-m-d-H-i', time());
        $this -> redis -> hset($key, array($data["deviceid"] => $productId));
        $this -> redis -> expire($key, 30 * 60);

        //For realtime areas
        $key = "razor_r_arc_p_" . $productId . "_c_" . $data["country"] . "_" . date('Y-m-d-H-i', time());
        $this -> redis -> hset($key, array($data["country"] => $productId));

```
