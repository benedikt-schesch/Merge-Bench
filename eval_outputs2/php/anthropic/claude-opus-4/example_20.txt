Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the `$module->class` property, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Checks if `$module->class` is set and provides an empty string as fallback
- **Other branch**: Directly uses `$module->class` without checking if it exists

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both want to include the module's class in the div element. However, HEAD's approach is more defensive by handling the case where `$module->class` might not be set, which would prevent potential PHP notices/warnings.

Here's the resolved version that preserves the safer approach from HEAD:

```php
    foreach($args as $key => $val) {
        $argstr[] = "$key=" . urlencode($val);
    }
    $argstr = "'" . implode("&", $argstr) . "'";
    $style = "width: {$module->width}px;";
    $class = isset($module->class) ? $module->class : '';
    if (isset($module->height)) $style .= " height: {$module->height}px";
    echo "<div class='module $class' id='$module->name' style='$style'></div>\n";
    echo "\t<script type='text/javascript'>activate_module('$module->name', $module->update, $argstr);</script>\n\n";
}

?>
