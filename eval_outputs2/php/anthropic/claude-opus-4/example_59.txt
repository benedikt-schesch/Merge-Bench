Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same file header documentation, but with different changes:

1. **HEAD side**: Updates the copyright year range to 2007-2009 and keeps the subpackage as `media.libs.media`
2. **Incoming side**: Updates the copyright year range to 2007-2010 and changes the subpackage to `media.libs.medium`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Update the copyright year to the most recent (2010)
- Update the subpackage name from `media.libs.media` to `media.libs.medium` (likely a refactoring)
- The file path also changed from `vendors/media/css.php` to `vendors/medium/css.php`

Since the incoming change has a more recent copyright year and appears to be part of a deliberate refactoring (changing from "media" to "medium"), the incoming changes should be accepted.
