The version numbers reflect different semantic versioning intents: one indicates ongoing development for a minor version (`1.1.x-dev`), while the other represents a patch release (`1.0.3`). Without explicit context about branch strategy (e.g., `main` vs. `develop`) or which version is authoritative, the semantic intent remains ambiguous. Per instructions, the conflict is preserved.
