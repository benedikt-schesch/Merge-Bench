The merge conflict arises from two distinct modifications to two separate lines: (1) the `@subpackage` intends to represent the directory structure or a correction upon reviewing the naming convention, and (2) the `@copyright` reflects an update to the time period indicating continued development.

Since **no definitive semantic intent** is clearly stated in either change that overrides the other, **but both sides appear valid and separable**, we can resolve the conflict by combining the intended changes from **both branches**.

- **`@subpackage`**: The HEAD version suggests the file is part of `vendors/media/...`, so the subpackage `media.libs.media` aligns more logically with that naming convention.
- **`@copyright`**: The incoming branch correctly extends the copyright to 2010, likely indicating that contributions or updates occurred in that time frame.

Therefore, resolving this merge conflict by **retaining both logically independent updates** seems semantically appropriate and respectful of both contributorsâ€™ intent, assuming both were conscious decisions.
