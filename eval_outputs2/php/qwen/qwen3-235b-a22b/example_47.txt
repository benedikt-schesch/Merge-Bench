**Resolution Explanation (provided for clarity, not integrated):**  
The conflict lies in the renaming of a directory and subpackage (`media` vs. `medium`) and the update of the copyright year. Although the newer date and `medium` reference in the incoming branch suggest it may be a more recent change, the code itself still imports classes using the `media` vendor path (e.g., `Media.VideoMedia`). This creates a mismatch if the package has truly been renamed or moved to `medium`. 

Without confirmation that the underlying code (outside the snippet) has also been updated to reflect the `medium` package and path changes, the intent remains ambiguous. Therefore, preserving the conflict allows the developer to resolve it with the full context in mind.
