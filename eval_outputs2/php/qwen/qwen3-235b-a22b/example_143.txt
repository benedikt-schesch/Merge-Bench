As per the conflict, the resolution is made to preserve the intent of ensuring that the item or component being manipulated is marked as active correctly when the specific condition applies. The line setting `isActive` to `true` clearly indicates that the functionality is directly tied to updating the internal state of the object. Given the logic exposed and the evolution from the base context, it is reasonable to include this line in the final resolved snippet.

Since the blank line between this line and the `return $this` call was explicitly present in the `HEAD` version and since we are instructed to preserve the context and spacing exactly as provided, the blank line is retained for consistency and clarity within that method.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```php

			return $this;
		}

		$this->attributes['class'] = Builder::formatGroupClass(array('class' => $this->builder->conf('active_class')), $this->attributes);
		$this->isActive = true;
		
		return $this;
	}

	/**
	 * Set or get items's meta data
```
