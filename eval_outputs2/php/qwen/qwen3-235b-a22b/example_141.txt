The intended functionality appears to provide flexibility on how the `nickname` value is determined. Upon analysis:

- The `HEAD` version allows for an explicit `nickname` to be provided through the `$options` array. If not present, it defaults to transforming the `title` using `camel_case(Str::ascii($title))`. This approach enhances configurability by enabling external override when needed.

- The `ae04fd8` version removes that configurability and mandates that the nickname is always generated from the `title`. While this guarantees consistency, it sacrifices flexibility.

**Key consideration**: Resolving in favor of keeping the flexibility to override the nickname allows both configuration and default behavior. This better serves general design principles of extensibility without losing safety (the default is preserved when not overridden).

Thus, the resolution should use the line from `HEAD` to retain the conditional check and allow nickname override.

Here is the full snippet with the resolved merge conflict:

```php
	public function __construct($builder, $id, $title, $options)
	{
		$this->builder     = $builder;
		$this->id          = $id;
		$this->title       = $title;
		$this->nickname    = isset($options['nickname']) ? $options['nickname'] : camel_case(Str::ascii($title));
		$this->attributes  = $this->builder->extractAttributes($options); 
		$this->parent      = (is_array($options) && isset($options['parent'])) ? $options['parent'] : null;


		// Storing path options with each link instance.
		if(!is_array($options)) {
