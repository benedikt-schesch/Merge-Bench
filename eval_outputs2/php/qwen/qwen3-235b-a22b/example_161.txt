In order to appropriately resolve this merge conflict from a semantic perspective, we must carefully analyze the intent behind both branches and assess whether the conflict can be resolved without deeper ambiguity in the structure or dependencies of the project.

---

### Summary of the Conflict

- **HEAD (Current branch)**:
  - Uses `namespace Mantis\tests\rest;`, which entails an object-oriented design where classes are fully namespaced.
  - Imports `Mantis\tests\MantisCoreBase` with a `use` statement, indicating a reliance on autoloading or bundled namespace resolution.
  - Omits explicit `require_once` directives.

- **Theirs (Other branch, `efa5c907...`)**:
  - Omits any namespace declaration and uses old-style explicit `require_once` statements.
    - `'RestBase.php'`: likely contains class or functionality required for REST testing in this file.
    - `'Mantis/MantisCoreBase.php'`: implies a directory structure where the `MantisCoreBase` is not namespaced or only namespaced under `Mantis`.

---

### Semantic Intent

Both versions are aiming to include:

1. The `RestBase` functionality.
2. The `MantisCoreBase` functionality.

The primary difference lies in the mechanism used to access these:

- One branch assumes a modern PHP project utilizing autoloading and namespaces.
- The other is likely working in a test environment that requires explicit file inclusion.

Additionally, a key point of contention lies in the namespace path used to reference `MantisCoreBase`:

- `Mantis\tests\MantisCoreBase`: suggests the class may reside within the tests suite.
- `Mantis/MantisCoreBase.php`: implies the class is loaded from a separate, internal source—possibly in a base directory tied to the `Mantis` namespace.

---

### Resolver Dilemma

If `MantisCoreBase` belongs to the `Mantis` namespace in a non-test source tree, then the class referenced by `Mantis\tests\MantisCoreBase` is likely a different `MantisCoreBase`—either a mock, stub, or test-specific override.

This indicates a **semantic divergence** in **which class** is being referenced—not just how it's being included—and constitutes unclear intent without knowing which `MantisCoreBase` is desired for this test context.

Likewise, the lack of a `require_once 'RestBase.php'` in HEAD is another divergence—an indication that this file might be pulled in through an autoloader or elsewhere, but it’s not clear from this segment alone.

---

### Resolution Outcome

Given the ambiguity in intent and the possibility of including different implementations of `MantisCoreBase` (and potentially missing `RestBase`), **the safest action** is to **leave the conflict markers intact**, as the provided information is insufficient to confidently assert that one branch's logic supersedes the other.
