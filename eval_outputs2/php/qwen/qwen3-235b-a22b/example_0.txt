The merge conflict in the provided code snippet occurs on the `Version` line of a WordPress plugin header comment block. This line has been modified differently in two branches being merged:

- `HEAD` contains `Version: 1.4.0`
- The incoming commit (`bc343c6b`) contains `Version: 1.4.1`

---

In semantic versioning, the version number often reflects the state of the codebase: major, minor, or patch updates. This suggests the branch containing `1.4.1` may represent newer changes than `HEAD`, but without deeper knowledge of the actual commits involved or the merging strategy, it's not possible to determine definitively which version should be chosen.

Since both lines attempt to update the **same metadata field** and there's **no additional contextual information** to guide which is the correct version (e.g., dependency changes, backward compatibility, or other changelog entries that align with a version bump), the intent remains **ambiguous**.

---

As per the instructions, if the intent or resolution is uncertain, the snippet must be returned unchanged, **with the merge conflict markers preserved** and spacing intact. Therefore, the resolution is:
