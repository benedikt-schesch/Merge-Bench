The merge conflict occurs in the `VERSION` constant, where two distinct version strings represent different **intentions**:

- `const VERSION = '13.x-dev';` marks the version as an **unstable development** version (typically used in active development on the `main` or `master` branch for upcoming major releases).
- `const VERSION = '12.18.0';` represents a **stable, tagged release** of the application (like what you'd expect in the `12.x` release branch).

---

The intent can be interpreted semantically, but **the exact intent depends on the branch being merged into**, and there is **no definitive way to determine** this purely from the provided context. If the branch receives this merge intending to stay current with stable releases, `'12.18.0'` is the logical resolution. If the branch is still on an actively developed, unreleased `13.x` feature set, then `'13.x-dev'` makes more sense.

Because the branch context and merge direction are not clear, the intent cannot be inferred with certainty.

As instructed, **when the semantic intent is ambiguous, the unmodified or unresolved merge conflict should be returned with all context preserved**. Here is the snippet formatted in markdown as specified:
