The merge conflict arises from conflicting changes in version identifier strings and Git references. Both changes are semantically related to the active branch contextâ€”one representing `dev-develop`, the other `dev-master`. Since the resolution depends on which branch is intended to take precedence and no clear contextual clues are offered about the desired outcome, the safest and most neutral choice is to preserve the conflict marker and surrounding content as originally provided.
