The merge conflict involves two versions of Tamil translations for time duration phrases. The intent appears to be correctly displaying "X months ago" in Tamil, but there is a semantic discrepancy between the phrases:

- `HEAD` uses: `1 மாதம் இல்` and `3 மாதங்கள் இல்`  
- Other branch uses: `1 மாதத்தில் இல்` and `3 மாதங்களில் இல்`

The difference lies in the grammatical form of the time unit. While `HEAD` is using the direct form (`மாதம்`, `மாதங்கள்`) followed by `இல்` (which can mean "ago"), the other branch replaces these with the locative form (`மாதத்தில்`, `மாதங்களில்`) which could imply "in the month" or similar. The suffix `இல்` appears redundantly added in both versions.

In Tamil grammar, "ago" is often expressed as a formulation like `X இல்`, where `X` is a time duration in its direct form (e.g., "1 month ago" = `1 மாதம் இல்`). The use of locative forms (`மாதத்தில்`) with a redundant `இல்` may not be idiomatic.

However, without further context or confirmation from native speakers/established translations, the semantic intent of either version cannot be conclusively determined.

Per the instruction, when intent and semantics are ambiguous:

```php
        ///

        $oneAgo = Date::parse('1 month');
        $fiveAgo = Date::parse('3 months');

<<<<<<< HEAD
        $this->assertEquals('1 மாதம் இல்', $oneAgo->ago());
        $this->assertEquals('3 மாதங்கள் இல்', $fiveAgo->ago());
=======
        $this->assertEquals('1 மாதத்தில் இல்', $oneAgo->ago());
        $this->assertEquals('3 மாதங்களில் இல்', $fiveAgo->ago());

        $fiveAgo = Date::parse('3 years');
