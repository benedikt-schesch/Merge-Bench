The conflict exists in the Laravel framework version constant. Both versions appear valid but represent different intentions: one is a development branch version (`13.x-dev`), and the other is a released version (`12.14.1`). Without explicit context about the branch purpose or release cycle, **the intent is ambiguous**. For example, it is unclear whether:

- The project is preparing for a `13.x` release with ongoing changes (favoring `13.x-dev`), or
- The code should reflect an already released/stable version (`12.14.1`)

Returning the conflict as-is to preserve correctness.
