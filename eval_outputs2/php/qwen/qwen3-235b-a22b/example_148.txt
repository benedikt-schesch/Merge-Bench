The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict between two different approaches to returning JSON-formatted messages. One branch returns structured JSON objects with the keys `"cenInfo"` and `"cenError"`, while the other returns simple JSON strings.

```php
						}
					}

					saveFile("$directory/$groupName/$userName/propertyPerm.txt", json_encode($outputPermProperties));
				}
<<<<<<< HEAD
				echo '{"cenInfo":"permissions updated"}';
			} else {
				echo '{"cenError":"permissions cannot be edited on default user"}';
=======
				echo json_encode("Permissions updated");
			} else {
				echo json_encode("Permissions cannot be edited on default user");
>>>>>>> 932edc459d685aded53c1b84a268053b59f506be
			}

		} else if ($action === "getOfflinePerm") {
			$openedPerm = openFile("$directory/$groupName/$userName/offlinePerm.txt", 50000);
			echo json_encode($openedPerm);
```

### ⚠️ Conflict Resolution Analysis:

- **HEAD** intends to return a structured JSON object with specific keys (`"cenInfo"` and `"cenError"`), possibly to align with a larger API or client-side parsing system.
- The **other branch** intends to return a raw string message encoded through `json_encode` which will produce `"Permissions updated"` instead of an object.
  
While both versions semantically indicate a success or error state, **they differ in format and expected structure**, which may affect any consuming code in the backend or frontend. Since the expected structure and integration behavior is not explicitly known from the provided snippet, merging either side would risk violating intended usage or breaking compatibility with other components.

### ✅ Verdict:

Because the semantic intent of the expected JSON format (object vs. string) is ambiguous from the snippet provided, **the conflict must remain unresolved** to avoid introducing unintended behavior.

**No resolution was performed.**
