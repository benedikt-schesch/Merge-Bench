The code snippet contains a merge conflict that primarily involves two syntactic differences related to:

1. **PHPUnit DataProvider Annotation Style**:  
   - `@dataProvider matchesDataProvider` (DocBlock annotation style)  
   - `#[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider('matchesDataProvider')]` (Attribute-based style introduced in PHP 8+)

2. **Void Return Type**:  
   - `public function testMatches($arg): void`  
   - `public function testMatches($arg)`

---

### Semantic Intent Analysis

- Both changes aim to attach the same functionality (`matchesDataProvider`) to the `testMatches()` method. The only difference is the syntax used.  
- The presence/absence of `: void` is a modernization choice, not functionally necessary in PHPUnit versions < 9. However, if `: void` is present in the `HEAD` but absent in the other branch, both changes can be harmonized if the codebase uses PHP 7.1+ and encourages return type declarations.

---

### Resolution Decision

- **Choose Attribute Syntax**: Modern PHP projects using PHP 8+ should prefer Attributes (`#[...]`) as it aligns with current language trends and avoids issues with docblock parsing.
- **Include `: void` Return Type**: This enforces type safety and is a good practice. There is no semantic conflict in including it unless there are compatibility constraints with older test runners.

### Final Resolved Snippet

Backticks and formatting preserved exactly as requested.

```php
    }

    /**
     * @dataProvider matchesDataProvider
     */
    #[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider('matchesDataProvider')]
    public function testMatches($arg): void
    {
        $this->assertNull($this->matcher->doArgumentsMatch($arg));
    }

    public function testToString(): void
```
