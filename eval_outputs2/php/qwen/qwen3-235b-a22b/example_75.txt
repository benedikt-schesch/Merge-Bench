The merge conflict in the provided code snippet presents an ambiguity in version intent. One side (`HEAD`) specifies a development version (`1.7.0-dev`), while the other (`8a65ad9...`) specifies a stable release version (`1.6.2`). Without additional project-specific context about which branch this code is intended to represent (e.g., whether the active development is targeted at the next minor or patch version), the intent cannot be resolved definitively.

Therefore, the conflict must remain unresolved to avoid the risk of incorrectly overwriting one meaningful version number with another. This decision respects both possible development intentions and defers the choice to the developers who understand the context of each branch.

Here is the unchanged snippet, preserving all spacing and the original conflict markers:

```php
    /**
     * The Flarum version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const VERSION = '1.7.0-dev';
=======
    const VERSION = '1.6.2';
>>>>>>> 8a65ad980d2dd588c4528310a2ef1d9192abac96

    /**
     * The IoC container for the Flarum application.
     *
     * @var Container
