The provided merge conflict involves two distinct changes: one introduces time tracking and random number seeding (from `HEAD`), while the other adjusts error reporting and locale settings (from the other branch). These operations are not logically interdependent and address different aspects of application configuration.

--- 

To preserve the intent of both changes, **all relevant lines** from both branches should be merged **sequentially**, maintaining the original context and spacing around the conflict. Since there are no logical dependencies between these changes, they can safely appear in any order after the shared preceding line (`$flux_addons = new flux_addon_manager();`).

Here is the full resolved code snippet in the required markdown format:

```php
forum_remove_bad_characters();

// The addon manager is responsible for storing the hook listeners and communicating with the addons
$flux_addons = new flux_addon_manager();

// Record the start time (will be used to calculate the generation time for the page)
$pun_start = get_microtime();

// Seed the random number generator for systems where this does not happen automatically
mt_srand();

// Make sure PHP reports all errors except E_NOTICE. FluxBB supports E_ALL, but a lot of scripts it may interact with, do not
error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE);

// Force POSIX locale (to prevent functions such as strtolower() from messing up UTF-8 strings)
setlocale(LC_CTYPE, 'C');
```
