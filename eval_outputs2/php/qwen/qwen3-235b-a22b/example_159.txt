The provided code contains a merge conflict that represents two different approaches for handling class prefix registration, likely within an autoloader. On one side (HEAD), the code checks and updates a flat array `$this->prefixes`. On the other (af25d22a), the logic has been updated to use a nested structure `$this->prefixesPsr0`, keyed by the first character of the prefix (common for PSR-0 autoloading to preserve case sensitivity during lookup).

---

The core difference lies in the data structure used for class prefix paths:

- `prefixes[$prefix] = (array) $paths` implies flat namespace mapping.
- `prefixesPsr0[$first][$prefix] = (array) $paths` implies a PSR-0-compliant layout where the first character serves as a case-insensitive first lookup layer.

Both versions end with a `return;`, suggesting that the prefix has been registered and no further action is needed in either branch. However, due to the structural change in the data being stored, these two versions are fundamentally incompatible. Merging them without understanding the broader impact could break functionality.

Since the intent of both branches is not entirely aligned (one appears to be legacy or flat registration while the other is structured for PSR-0), the semantic intent is ambiguous **within this snippet**. Therefore, it's **not safe** to resolve this conflict without more context.

Below is the exact original snippet including full context and original spacing, as requested:

```php
                );
            }

            return;
        }
<<<<<<< HEAD
        if (!isset($this->prefixes[$prefix])) {
            $this->prefixes[$prefix] = (array) $paths;
=======
        
        $first = $prefix[0];
        if (!isset($this->prefixesPsr0[$first][$prefix])) {
            $this->prefixesPsr0[$first][$prefix] = (array) $paths;
>>>>>>> af25d22af4fc32920cf7d332f16e832e79ac6915

            return;
        }
        if ($prepend) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
