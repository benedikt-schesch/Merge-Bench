To resolve this merge conflict, we need to analyze the semantic intent of the code and ensure the logic flows correctly, preserving the program’s expected behavior.

---

### **Understanding the Code's Purpose**

The snippet checks whether a custom post type slug conflicts with an existing:

1. **Post Type**: via the filter `cptui_post_type_slug_exists`. If it does, display a custom error and return `'error'`.
2. **Page slug**: But only if it’s a new post type being registered, via a call to `cptui_check_page_slugs`.

This logical progression is critical to maintaining the integrity of slug registration and avoiding duplicate slugs across different types in WordPress.

### **Conflict Analysis**

The merge conflict occurs in the area directly after:

```php
		if ( true === $slug_exists ) {
			add_filter( 'cptui_custom_error_message', 'cptui_slug_matches_post_type' );
			return 'error';
		}
```

Then we find:

```php
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
>>>>>>> 87a406bda6b64d7103e4334a33c192b715bca89f
		if ( 'new' == $data['cpt_type_status'] ) {
```

This conflict has **no differentiating content** between `HEAD` and the incoming commit. This usually indicates that there was a now-resolved divergence from a common ancestor version that previously contained logic in this area.

Given that:

- There is **no divergence** between the two branches in terms of added content in the conflict area.
- The logic in the rest of the function depends on checking both **post type **and
- No changed logic was pinpointed between the two branches,

we can **safely assume** that the area of conflict was intended to be empty and that the merge conflict markers are spurious and should be removed.

---

### **Resolution**

Remove the conflict markers and leave the logical flow as it was intended: check for a post type conflict, then—if new—check for a page conflict.

Here is the fully resolved code snippet:

```php
	$slug_exists = apply_filters( 'cptui_post_type_slug_exists', false, $data['cpt_custom_post_type']['name'], $post_types );
	if ( true === $slug_exists ) {
		add_filter( 'cptui_custom_error_message', 'cptui_slug_matches_post_type' );
		return 'error';
	}

	if ( 'new' == $data['cpt_type_status'] ) {
		$slug_as_page = cptui_check_page_slugs( $data['cpt_custom_post_type']['name'] );
		if ( true === $slug_as_page ) {
			add_filter( 'cptui_custom_error_message', 'cptui_slug_matches_page' );
			return 'error';
```

This version removes the merge conflict markers and preserves the logical, functional structure of the code around the conflict without adding or omitting new logic.
