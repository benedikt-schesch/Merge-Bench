The conflict arises between two versions of a comment describing the creation of a `.jaxl` directory with associated subdirectories â€” `/tmp`, `/run`, and `/log`. The divergence lies in wording, specifically whether to mention the base directory `JAXL_CWD`:

- HEAD indicates the directory is created *for* those subdirectories.
- ce7bc8c9 clarifies the directory is specifically created *in* `JAXL_CWD`.

Both comments attempt to explain the semantic purpose: to set up a structure for `.jaxl` subdirectories, which are later assigned to properties like `$this->tmp_dir`. The variable `$this->priv_dir` is explicitly assigned from a config value, giving flexibility to the underlying path. 

Without explicit context confirming that `JAXL_CWD` is indeed the expected default for `$this->priv_dir`, and considering the goal of preserving semantics and resolving only when intent is clear, the ambiguity in relation between `priv_dir` and `JAXL_CWD` implies that merging the comment with certainty would risk semantic inaccuracy.

Accordingly, the original conflicting code is preserved exactly as provided:

```php
            pcntl_signal(SIGHUP, array($this, 'signal_handler'));
            pcntl_signal(SIGINT, array($this, 'signal_handler'));
            pcntl_signal(SIGTERM, array($this, 'signal_handler'));
        }

        $this->tmp_dir = $this->priv_dir."/tmp";
        $this->pid_dir = $this->priv_dir."/run";
        $this->log_dir = $this->priv_dir."/log";
```
