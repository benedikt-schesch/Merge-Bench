The provided code snippet reveals a merge conflict involving the `VERSION` constant. On the `HEAD` (local) branch, the version is set to `'15.0.0-dev'`, indicating a development version likely intended for upcoming changes or releases. On the other branch (identified by commit hash), the version is set to `'14.2.2'`, which typically suggests a patch-level stable release.

When resolving merge conflicts, the intended outcome—such as whether the code is being merged into a development branch, a stable release branch, or another environment—guides the correct resolution. However, in this case, the intent behind the merge and, therefore, the appropriate resolved version is not explicitly stated or determinable solely from the code surrounding the conflict.

Thus, the ambiguity of which version to prioritize prevents a confident semantic resolution. According to the instructions, the correct course is to return the full snippet with the existing conflict markers unperturbed, preserving all context and spacing as provided.
