The semantic intent of both branches is to specify the Laravel framework version as a constant. Since both versions represent different version numbers (without additional context indicating intent to move to a higher/lower version or resolve a regression), the correct resolution requires manual verification by the developer merging the branches.

```php
    /**
     * The Laravel framework version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const VERSION = '12.14.0';
=======
    const VERSION = '11.44.7';
>>>>>>> 43bcb81c412ef988dd818891a50d859d577a2df6

    /**
     * The base path for the Laravel installation.
     *
     * @var string
```
