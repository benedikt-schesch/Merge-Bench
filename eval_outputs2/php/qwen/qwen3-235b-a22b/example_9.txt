The merge conflict here occurs within the function documentation block (docblock) of `cptui_get_single_taxonomy_registery`. The conflict is between the `@return` tag in the local branch (`HEAD`) and an apparently removed or otherwise different version from the incoming branch (`87a406bda6b64d7103e4334a33c192b715bca89f`).

---

### Analysis:

- The `HEAD` revision explicitly documents that the function returns a string:  
  ```php
  * @return string
  ```
  
- In contrast, the incoming revision appears to have **removed** or **left blank** the `@return` line:
  ```
  =======
  >>>>>>> 87a406bda6b64d7103e4334a33c192b715bca89f
  ```

- From the function body, it's clear that the purpose of this function is to generate and return string output meant for copy/paste — likely PHP code related to a taxonomy registration.

---

### Semantic Intent:

Given the function's purpose — to build and return a string for output — it makes semantic sense for the `@return` to indicate a `string`. Removing the `@return` tag would be incorrect from both a documentation and tooling (e.g. IDEs, static analysis) perspective.

Since the conflict appears to be between a correct and useful return-type declaration (`@return string`) on one side and a missing or ambiguous version on the other, the resolution is clear.

---

### Resolution:

We resolve the conflict by retaining the `@return string` declaration from `HEAD`, as it accurately reflects the semantics of the function and is the most useful version in terms of documentation and type clarity.

### Final Merged Output:

```php
 * Create output for single taxonomy to be ready for copy/paste from Get Code.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
 *
 * @param array $taxonomy Taxonomy data to output. Optional.
 * @return string
 */
function cptui_get_single_taxonomy_registery( $taxonomy = array() ) {

	$post_types = "''";
	if ( is_array( $taxonomy['object_types'] ) ) {
```
