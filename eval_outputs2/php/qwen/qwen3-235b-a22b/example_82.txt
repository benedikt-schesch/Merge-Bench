The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict in the test annotation, specifically regarding the expected PHP exception type (`PHPUnit_Framework_Error_Warning` vs `PHPUnit_Framework_Error_Notice`). This line dictates what kind of PHP error is expected during the execution of `testJAXLXml_0()`, particularly for the call to `$xml->to_string()` on an empty `JAXLXml` instance.

The intent behind the test seems to be asserting that constructing an empty XML node and converting it to a string triggers a PHP-level error (not a thrown exception in application code). This is not altogether unexpected, depending on the internal behavior of `JAXLXml`—for instance, if it triggers a PHP error to flag malformed XML such as `<></>`.

The two branches differ in the type of error they expect:
- One expects a **Warning**.
- The other expects a **Notice**.

However, from the given snippet alone, **it's not possible to definitively determine the correct exception type** based on the original intent or the actual runtime behavior expected of `JAXLXml`. This is a critical point for semantic conflict resolution—*absent a clear signal about intent based on the actual runtime behavior or project preferences, merging blindly would risk introducing incorrect expectations or hiding bugs.*

Therefore, since the resolution cannot be made with confidence, and in accordance with instructions to preserve the conflict in such cases, the correct result is to **return the exact snippet with the unresolved conflict**.
