The conflict is between deferring a function call immediately (via `defer`) versus delaying it by 1 second (via `delay`). While both approaches aim to schedule the execution of the `posix_kill` call after the current loop tick, the specific choice of timing (`0` vs. `1`) changes the behavior significantly.

From a semantic perspective:

- `defer` schedules the closure to be run in the next tick of the event loop, ensuring the current setup is complete before triggering the signal.
- `delay(1, ...)` introduces an artificial delay of **1 second**, which alters the program logic in a non-trivial way.

Without additional context about **why** a 1-second delay was introduced (e.g., workarounds for specific race conditions or timing issues), neither the code nor the current context provides enough information to confidently choose one option over the other. Therefore, based on the ambiguity in intent, the appropriate response is to preserve and return the snippet **with the unresolved merge conflict**, as instructed.

            $args[] = $expectedData;
            \call_user_func_array([$loop, $type], $args);

            if ($type == "onSignal") {
