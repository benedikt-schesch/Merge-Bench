Here is the resolved snippet with the merge conflict addressed:

```php

	$offset = ($page-1)*QUESTIONS_PER_PAGE;

	$sql = ("select count(questions.id) count from questions $conditionspre WHERE $conditionspost 1");
	$query = mysql_query($sql);
	$result = mysql_fetch_array($query) or die("Query to get blah failed with error: ".mysql_error());

	$template->set('questionscount',$result['count']);

	$paging = new Pagination();
	$paging->set('urlscheme','?order='.$orderby.$tag.$type.$search.'&page=%page%');
	$paging->set('perpage',QUESTIONS_PER_PAGE);

```

### Resolution Rationale
- The original conflict stemmed from one branch re-executing the SQL query redundantly (`mysql_query($sql)`), while the other branch correctly used the already stored `$query` result.
- The resolution adopts the efficient practice of referencing `$query` directly and preserves vital error handling logic (`or die(...)`) from the secondary branch.
- Identical contextual lines and spacing are preserved as requested.
