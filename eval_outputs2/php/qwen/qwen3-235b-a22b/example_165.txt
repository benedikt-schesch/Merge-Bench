The merge conflict arises from differing intentions in defining the `LaravelLocalizationRoutes` class:

- **HEAD** (likely a previous version) extends `LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase`, implying shared behavior from a parent class.
- **5a4e015...** (likely a refactor or simplification) defines it as a standalone class with no parent.

---

Both changes aim to retain a `LaravelLocalizationRoutes` middleware with the same method signature, but they diverge in structure. Without additional context (e.g., the contents of `LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase` or when/why the rewrite occurred), it's ambiguous whether the parent class is fundamentally necessary. Removing inheritance might simplify code or align with new patterns, but could also remove important shared logic.

Since the intent isn't clear and both implementations claim the same class, **this should be resolved by the developer who made the changes**, as they have the context needed to decide whether inheritance is necessary or intentional.

```php
namespace Mcamara\LaravelLocalization\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class LaravelLocalizationRoutes extends LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase {
