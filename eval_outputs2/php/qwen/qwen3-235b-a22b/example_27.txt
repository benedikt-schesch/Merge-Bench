Given the merge conflict in your PHP configuration snippet, the resolution must carefully consider the intent and semantics behind the database definitions.

---

### Contextual Overview

The conflict lies in the configuration of the database credentials:

- **Current branch (`HEAD`):**
  ```php
  define('DBUSERNAME','your_db_username');
  define('DBPASSWORD','your_db_password');
  define('DBNAME','qwench');
  ```

- **Incoming changes (`3b68aa2f057443dff9f1fa3d086ddcb508257b62`):**
  ```php
  define('DBUSERNAME','your_db_username_here');
  define('DBPASSWORD','your_db_password_here');
  define('DBNAME','your_db_name_here');
  ```

Both sets are **placeholders**, likely intended for development or deployment use. However, there are differing stylistic choices:

- One uses `_here` to mark where the user should replace values.
- The other uses shorter terms and even a specific database name (`qwench`), which may hint at an actual internal use name or a test DB.

---

### Semantic Consideration

If we assume the goal is **updated placeholder uniformity**, the `your_*_here` style is more descriptive and consistent with a clean setup process for new users. On the other hand, if the constant `qwench` is part of a **specific deployment environment or internal usage**, it may be intentional and should be preserved.

However, **there is no definitive evidence in the surrounding code** (outside of the placeholders themselves) that clarifies which version better reflects *intent* or semantic meaning. Therefore, according to your instructions, **when ambiguity exists in intent**, we must **resolve to leave the conflict as is** and return the full snippet with the conflict markers intact.

### Final Output

```php
<?php

// Database Details
define('SERVERNAME','localhost');
define('SERVERPORT','3306');
<<<<<<< HEAD
define('DBUSERNAME','your_db_username');
define('DBPASSWORD','your_db_password');
