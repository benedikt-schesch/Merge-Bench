The merge conflict arises from two distinct modifications made at the same point in the code. The `HEAD` branch adds the new item to the collection via:

```php
$this->items->push($item);
```

Meanwhile, the other branch (`ae04fd8`) is responsible for tracking the ID of the last inserted item by setting:

```php
$this->last_id = $item->id;
```

Both changes are logically valid and should coexist in the final resolution. Neither of the two operations has a strict dependency on the order, but from a semantic standpoint, it is more appropriate to first insert the item into the collection and then record its ID as the "last inserted". This matches the intention expressed in the comment in the non-HEAD branch.

Therefore, the resolved version of the function should retain both operations in an order that reflects this intent: pushing the item into the collection first, followed by updating `last_id`.

Here is the fully-resolved code snippet, preserving all surrounding context and formatting:

```php
	public function add($title, $options = '')
	{
	
		$id = isset($options['id']) ? $options['id'] : $this->id();

		$item = new Item($this, $id, $title, $options);
		
		$this->items->push($item);
		// storing the last inserted item's id
		$this->last_id = $item->id;
		
		return $item;
	}
