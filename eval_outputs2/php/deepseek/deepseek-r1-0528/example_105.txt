The conflict arises from one branch adding a `$container` property and another branch adding a `$client` property at the same location in the class structure. Since both properties are compatible and have different names/roles, they should coexist. The resolution keeps both property declarations while maintaining proper docblock formatting and indentation.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```php
 * @author Chris Jones <leeked@gmail.com>
 */
class AuthorizeController
{
    /**
     * @var ContainerInterface
     */
    protected $container;
    /**
     * @var ClientInterface
     */
    private $client;

    /**
```
