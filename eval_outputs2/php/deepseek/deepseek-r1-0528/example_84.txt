The conflict involves a comment about the purpose of the `.jaxl` directory creation. Both versions convey similar intent, but the second version adds specificity about the directory location (`JAXL_CWD`). Since the code uses a configurable `priv_dir` value from `$this->cfg`, the location detail in the second comment might be valuable context.

However, without knowing if `JAXL_CWD` is a defined constant or relevant to the current codebase, this introduces ambiguity. The safest approach is to retain the conflict for manual resolution.

```php
            pcntl_signal(SIGHUP, array($this, 'signal_handler'));
            pcntl_signal(SIGINT, array($this, 'signal_handler'));
            pcntl_signal(SIGTERM, array($this, 'signal_handler'));
        }
