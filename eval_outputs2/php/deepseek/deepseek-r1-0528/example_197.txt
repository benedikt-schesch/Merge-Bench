The merge conflict involves two different approaches to specifying the data provider for a PHPUnit test method. The HEAD branch uses a traditional docblock annotation with a return type hint, while the other branch uses a PHP 8 attribute without a return type. 

Since the changes conflict at both the syntax level (annotation vs attribute) and the implementation level (return type presence), and because modifying the context (docblock) is required for a proper resolution, the conflict cannot be safely resolved while preserving the surrounding context. The docblock above the conflict is also part of the semantic change but isn't included in the conflict markers.

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php


    /**
     * @dataProvider magicGetInvalidData
     */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    public function testMagicGetWithInvalidData($invalidData, $exceptionContains): void
=======
    #[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider('magicGetInvalidData')]
    public function testMagicGetWithInvalidData($invalidData, $exceptionContains)
>>>>>>> 78e410ae3ae8d3249e757e46cbab122d33af879e
    {
        $this->expectException(\InvalidArgumentException::class);
        $this->proxy->__get($invalidData);
    }


```
