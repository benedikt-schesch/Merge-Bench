Based on the semantic analysis, I'll resolve the conflict by preserving both functionalities. The `$strpos_func` assignment from HEAD appears to be an intentional addition for string position handling, while the other branch maintains the lowercase functionality. Here's the resolved snippet:

```php
     * @param int $numWords Number of words (lines) to read from the file
     * @return string|array|bool  Returns a string if only one word is to be read, or an array of words
     */
    protected function readCodeFromFile($numWords = 1)
    {
        $strpos_func     = 'strpos';
        $strtolower_func = 'strtolower';
        $mb_support      = false;

        if (!empty($this->wordlist_file_encoding)) {
            if (!extension_loaded('mbstring')) {

```

Rationale:
1. The HEAD addition (`$strpos_func = 'strpos'`) is likely preparing for string position operations later in the function
2. The other branch maintains essential string lowering functionality
3. Both variables serve distinct purposes (`strpos` vs `strtolower`)
4. The assignments are independent and don't conflict semantically
5. The mbstring extension check remains unchanged and relevant to both contexts

The resolution maintains both functionalities while preserving original spacing and context.
