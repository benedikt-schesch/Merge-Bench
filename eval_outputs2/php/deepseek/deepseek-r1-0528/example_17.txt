The merge conflict involves the version number in the plugin header. Since the version numbers (25.4-RC4 vs 25.3.1) represent different release stages and the conflict can't be automatically resolved without knowing the intended release strategy, I'm returning the code with the conflict markers intact. This requires manual resolution to determine which version number should be used.
