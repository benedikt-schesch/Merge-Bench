I've analyzed the merge conflict in the provided PHP snippet. The conflict arises from two different approaches to setting up a mock dependency:

1. **HEAD version** uses `new Table()`
2. **Other branch** uses `$this->console`

After considering the context and semantics:
- Both are trying to provide a dependency to the `ScheduleService` mock
- The closure that follows doesn't interact with this dependency
- The test logic appears to depend on command scheduling behavior, not the specific dependency type
- Without additional context about the test class or `ScheduleService` requirements, the intent is ambiguous

Since I can't determine which dependency is correct for this test scenario, I'm returning the original code with the conflict markers intact as instructed.

```php

    public function testLogNotScheduled()
    {
        $command = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\ScheduledCommand');
        $scheduleService = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService[getScheduledCommands,isDue]', [
<<<<<<< HEAD
                new Table()

                $this->console

            ], function ($m) use (&$command) {
                $scheduler = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\Schedulable');
                $command->shouldReceive('schedule')->once()
                    ->andReturn($scheduler);
