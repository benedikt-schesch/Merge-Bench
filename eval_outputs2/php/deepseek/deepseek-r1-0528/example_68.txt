The conflict involves two different version hashes for the same dependency array. Since version hashes are typically generated by build tools and represent unique file content, choosing one arbitrarily would risk breaking functionality. Without knowing which branch contains the more recent or correct build artifact, this conflict cannot be safely resolved automatically.

Here's the unchanged snippet with the conflict markers preserved:

```php
<<<<<<< HEAD
<?php return array('dependencies' => array('wp-element', 'wp-polyfill'), 'version' => 'af642828c64ae474a5ccc0f119470f6e');
=======
<?php return array('dependencies' => array('wp-element', 'wp-polyfill'), 'version' => '576df7555644343f1d4ec8564e2b2d5f');
>>>>>>> 0b9cd0d78e652fa150e6c11964c89d3e9778c1e9

``` 

To resolve this:
1. Identify which branch contains the desired version of the built asset
2. Rebuild the asset from source if necessary
3. Manually update the version hash to match the correct build output
