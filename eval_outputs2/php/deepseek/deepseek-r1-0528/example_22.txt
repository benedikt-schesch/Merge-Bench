The conflict involves two different approaches to triggering a signal in an event loop test. The key differences are:

1. **HEAD version** uses `$loop->defer()` which executes immediately in the next event loop tick
2. **Other branch** uses `$loop->delay(1)` which introduces a 1-second delay

Since both approaches represent fundamentally different timing behaviors and we lack context about the test's timing requirements, the conflict cannot be automatically resolved. The intent is ambiguous without knowing whether:
- The test requires immediate execution (defer)
- The test requires artificial delay (delay)
- The test needs to simulate time-based behavior

Here's the unchanged output preserving the conflict markers:

```php
            }
            $args[] = $expectedData;
            \call_user_func_array([$loop, $type], $args);

            if ($type == "onSignal") {
<<<<<<< HEAD
                $loop->defer(function (): void {
=======
                $loop->delay(1, function () {
>>>>>>> eb2f325586bc6ebb12d27834fc779fa140c38a57
                    \posix_kill(\getmypid(), \SIGUSR1);
                });
            }
        });
