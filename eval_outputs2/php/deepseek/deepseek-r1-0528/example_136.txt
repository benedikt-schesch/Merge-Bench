The conflict arises from different approaches to escaping strings for HTML assertions. The HEAD version uses a simple `e()` helper function, while the incoming change introduces more sophisticated handling with `EncodedHtmlString::convert()` that considers Markdown context. Since the incoming change provides more context-aware escaping (especially important for Markdown content), it should be preferred while preserving the original method structure.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
     * @param  bool  $escape
     * @return $this
     */
    public function assertSeeInOrderInHtml($strings, $escape = true)
    {
        $strings = $escape ? array_map(function ($string) {
            return EncodedHtmlString::convert($string, withQuote: isset($this->markdown));
        }, $strings) : $strings;

        [$html, $text] = $this->renderForAssertions();

        PHPUnit::assertThat($strings, new SeeInOrder($html));


```

Key resolution points:
1. Kept the incoming change's closure implementation for better Markdown handling
2. Preserved the ternary structure and parameter names
3. Maintained surrounding context including the extra parenthesis in `PHPUnit::assertThat`
4. The solution addresses both escaping needs and Markdown context awareness
