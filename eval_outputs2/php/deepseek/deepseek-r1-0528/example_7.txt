I've analyzed the merge conflict. The intent appears to be maintaining a list of reserved post types. The HEAD branch added four new entries (`custom_css`, `customize_changeset`, `author`, and `post_type`) to the list, while the other branch didn't modify the existing list. Since these additions seem intentional and don't conflict with existing entries, I've resolved the conflict by keeping all entries.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
		'nav_menu_item',
		'action',
		'order',
		'theme',
		'fields',
		'custom_css',
		'customize_changeset',
		'author',
		'post_type',
	);

	/**
	 * Filters the list of reserved post types to check against.
	 *
```
