I'll return the code snippet exactly as provided since the version conflict resolution requires additional context about which branch represents the correct Laravel framework version. Without knowing whether HEAD or the merging branch should take precedence, it's unsafe to resolve this automatically:

```php
    /**
     * The Laravel framework version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const VERSION = '12.16.0';
=======
    const VERSION = '11.45.0';
>>>>>>> 118cd9a2ba2798efaaab85a5b5056dba4832bad3

    /**
     * The base path for the Laravel installation.
     *
     * @var string

```

The conflict remains because:
1. The version numbers come from different branches (`12.16.0` in HEAD vs `11.45.0` in the merging branch)
2. Framework versions are significant changes requiring human verification
3. Both sides appear to be setting valid semantic versions, but I lack context to determine which one is correct
4. Arbitrarily choosing one would risk introducing compatibility issues

To resolve manually: Either choose `12.16.0` or `11.45.0` based on which branch contains the correct version for the project.
