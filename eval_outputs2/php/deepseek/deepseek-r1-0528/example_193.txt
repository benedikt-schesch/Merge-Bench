The conflict arises from differences in how the test method is annotated and declared. The HEAD version uses a docblock `@group` annotation and includes a return type `: void`, while the other branch uses a PHP 8 attribute for grouping and omits the return type. 

The resolution preserves the method description, upgrades the group annotation to a modern PHP attribute, and retains the return type for better type safety. This combines the semantic intent of both changes:

1. Keeps the docblock description for documentation
2. Uses PHP 8 attribute for group annotation (modern practice)
3. Maintains `: void` return type (type safety improvement)

Resolved code:
```php

    /**
     * Tests that calling a stubbed method will result in the stubbed answer being returned.
     */
    #[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Group('testonly')]
    public function testStubbedMethodsReturnStubbedAnswer(): void
    {
        $newClassName = str_replace('\\', '_', self::class) . '_TestClass7';
        $mockedClass  = \PhakeTest_MockedClass::class;

        $this->classGen->generate($newClassName, $mockedClass, $this->infoRegistry);
```
