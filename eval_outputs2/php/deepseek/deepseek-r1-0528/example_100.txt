The merge conflict arises from one branch adding a `use phpseclib3\Math\BigInteger;` statement while the other branch doesn't modify this section. The current class implements `JsonSerializable` and likely requires both classes to function properly, as validated by the fact that:
1. The `JsonSerializable` usage remains active post-merge
2. The `BigInteger` class is actively used in other parts of the class implementation in the incoming branch

The resolution adds the `BigInteger` import while preserving the existing JSON functionality. The whitespace and formatting are maintained exactly as in the original context.

```php
<?php

namespace Jenssegers\ImageHash;

use JsonSerializable;
use phpseclib3\Math\BigInteger;

class Hash implements JsonSerializable
{
    /**
     * A string containing zeros and ones
```
