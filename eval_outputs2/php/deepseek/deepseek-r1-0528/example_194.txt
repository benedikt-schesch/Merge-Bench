The conflict arises from two changes:
1. HEAD added a `: void` return type to the test method
2. The branch replaced the `@depends` annotation with a PHP 8 attribute

The semantic intent is consistent - both want to declare a test dependency and implement the test method. We can preserve the modern attribute syntax while keeping the return type added in HEAD.

Resolved version:
```php
    }

    #[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Depends('testInitialize')]
    public function testNamespaceAliasOnVar(): void
    {
        $this->initializer->initialize($this);

        $this->assertInstanceOf(\Phake\IMock::class, $this->shortNameMock1);
    }

```
