The merge conflict involves the `VERSION` constant declaration with conflicting values (`1.1.x-dev` vs `1.0.x-dev`). Since version constants are typically unique and intentionally set in each branch, this conflict requires manual resolution to determine the correct version. The intent is ambiguous without additional context about which version should take precedence in the merged codebase.

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php
 * @author Kazuyuki Hayashi <hayashi@valnur.net>
 */
class Ciconia
{

<<<<<<< HEAD
    const VERSION = '1.1.x-dev';
=======
    const VERSION = '1.0.x-dev';
>>>>>>> def909be82b1825167ad632e812f08d181e230c7

    /**
     * @var RendererInterface
     */
    private $renderer;
```

**Resolution Recommendation**:  
A developer should decide whether to keep the `1.1.x-dev` (HEAD) or `1.0.x-dev` (incoming branch) version based on the project's versioning strategy and merge context. The surrounding context remains unchanged as requested.
