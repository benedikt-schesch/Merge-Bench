Based on analyzing the merge conflict, I'll resolve it by selecting the changes from branch `1922e0642ffe071618008478f0adbdf77fea7d99` since they represent the most recent copyright update and reflect a clear refactoring of the library structure. Here's the resolved version:

```php
 *
 * PHP version 5
 * CakePHP version 1.2
 *
 * @package    media
 * @subpackage media.libs.medium
 * @copyright  2007-2010 David Persson <davidpersson@gmx.de>
 * @license    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php The MIT License
 * @link       http://github.com/davidpersson/media
 */
App::import('Vendor', 'Media.MimeType');

```

Resolution rationale:
1. Copyright date updated to `2010` maintains current information
2. The `@subpackage` change to `medium` reflects intentional renaming/refactoring in the other branch
3. Both changes are semantically compatible with the existing context
4. File path difference in conflict markers indicates the file was likely moved/renamed in the other branch
