I've analyzed the provided code snippet with the merge conflict. The conflict involves two different sets of use statements and appears to be occurring in different file paths (`DateTime/Scheduler.php` vs `Cron/Scheduler.php`). This suggests the changes might be intended for different implementations (DateTime vs Cron drivers).

The intent is ambiguous because:
1. The use statements differ significantly (Day/Month/BadScheduleException vs App)
2. The files are in different directories, suggesting separate implementations
3. There's no context showing how these classes are used

Since I can't determine the semantic intent behind these changes and whether they should be merged or kept separate, I'm returning the snippet unchanged with the conflict markers intact:
