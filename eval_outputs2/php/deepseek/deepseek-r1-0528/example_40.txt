I've analyzed the merge conflict and determined that the intent is ambiguous. Both sides are changing the helper class name and instantiation method, but without more context about the project's naming conventions and architecture, I can't confidently resolve this conflict.

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved as requested:

```php
			'static' => array($this->TmpFolder->pwd() . 'static' . DS => 'media/static/'),
			'filter' => array($this->TmpFolder->pwd() . 'filter' . DS => 'media/filter/'),
			'transfer' => array($this->TmpFolder->pwd() . 'transfer' . DS => false),
			'theme' => array($this->TmpFolder->pwd() . 'theme' . DS  => 'media/theme/')
		);
<<<<<<< HEAD:tests/cases/views/helpers/media.test.php
		$this->Helper =& new MediaHelper($settings);
=======
		$this->Helper = new MediumHelper($settings);
>>>>>>> 9b74c9bb43dc19b022f7e7c8860247332e6a6a78:tests/cases/views/helpers/medium.test.php
	}

	function tearDown() {
		Configure::write('Media', $this->_config);
		$this->TestData->flushFiles();
```

Key reasons for preserving the conflict:
1. The helper class name differs (`MediaHelper` vs `MediumHelper`)
2. The instantiation method differs (reference assignment `=&` vs direct assignment `=`)
3. The file paths in the conflict markers suggest possible file renaming
4. Without knowing which helper implementation is current/correct, we risk introducing errors

A developer should manually resolve this by:
1. Checking which helper class exists in the codebase
2. Verifying if reference assignment is still needed
3. Ensuring consistent naming throughout the project
4. Potentially renaming the test file to match the helper name
