Here's the resolved snippet with the conflict resolved based on semantic intent:

```php

			if (!$Media) {
				$this->err('Failed to make version ' . $version . ' of media.');
				return false;
			}
			$Media->store($Folder->pwd() . $File->name, $this->overwrite);
		}
		return true;
	}
}
?>
```

### Resolution Reasoning:
1. **Variable Name Consistency**: The condition above the conflict checks `$Media`, indicating this variable exists in the current context. Using `$Medium` (from the other branch) would introduce an undefined variable error.

2. **Property Name Consistency**: The surrounding code uses `$this->err(...)` (without underscore prefix) suggesting the class follows a consistent naming convention. The HEAD version's `$this->overwrite` maintains this convention.

3. **Semantic Preservation**: Both branches intend to store media using similar parameters. The resolution maintains the HEAD version's object name while preserving the core functionality of both branches.

4. **Context Safety**: Since we lack broader context about `$Medium` or `_overwrite` in other parts of the file, sticking to the immediately visible context variables (`$Media` and `overwrite`) is safest.

The conflict is resolved by choosing the HEAD version since it maintains variable continuity and follows the established naming conventions visible in the provided snippet.
