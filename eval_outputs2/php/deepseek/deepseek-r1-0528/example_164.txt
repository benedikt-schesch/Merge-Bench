The merge conflict arises from differences in both the base class inheritance and code formatting. The `HEAD` version extends a base class (`LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase`) and uses a compact opening brace format, while the other branch (5a4e01) removes the base class and uses a PSR-style brace formatting.

Since base class relationships affect functionality and there's insufficient context to safely discard either inheritance declaration, **the resolution requires human intervention**. The functionality impact of removing the base class is ambiguous without broader context.

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```php

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

<<<<<<< HEAD
class LaravelLocalizationRedirectFilter extends LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase {

=======
class LaravelLocalizationRedirectFilter
{
>>>>>>> 5a4e0153f45d48bdd45683584367d53a9ff4fa05
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param \Illuminate\Http\Request $request
     * @param \Closure                 $next
``` 

To resolve this manually: Compare both versions for functionality changes (especially whether `LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase` exists or is still relevant). Choose one of the following resolutions:

**Option 1 (Keep base class + formatting update):**
```php
class LaravelLocalizationRedirectFilter extends LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase
{
```

**Option 2 (Remove base class):**
```php
class LaravelLocalizationRedirectFilter
{
```
