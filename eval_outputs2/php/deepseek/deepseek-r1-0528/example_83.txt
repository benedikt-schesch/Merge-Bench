I'll return the code snippet with the conflict markers as requested since the intent is ambiguous. The case sensitivity of constant names (VERSION vs version) and the differing version numbers (3.0.2 vs 3.0.3) create a semantic conflict that requires human judgment to resolve.

```php
 */
class JAXL extends XMPPStream
{
    
    // lib meta info
<<<<<<< HEAD:src/JAXL/jaxl.php
    const VERSION = '3.0.2';
    const NAME = 'JAXL :: Jabber XMPP Library';
=======
    const version = '3.0.3';
    const name = 'JAXL :: Jabber XMPP Library';
>>>>>>> ce7bc8c9e6848c6877016a3ebf8135404ef39bf7:jaxl.php
    
    // cached init config array
    public $cfg = array();
    


```
