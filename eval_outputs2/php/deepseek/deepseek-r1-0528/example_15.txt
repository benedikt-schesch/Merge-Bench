The conflict involves two different ways of constructing an exception message string. Both versions achieve the same semantic goal of including the `$name` variable in the error message, but use different syntax:

1. **HEAD version**: Uses `sprintf()` with a formatted string
2. **Other branch**: Uses string concatenation with embedded variable

Since both approaches are functionally equivalent and the intent is clear, I've resolved the conflict by selecting the more concise string concatenation approach which:
- Avoids unnecessary function call overhead
- Maintains better readability
- Uses consistent string syntax with surrounding code

The resolved code preserves all context and spacing while maintaining the original functionality.

```php
     */
    public function add($name, $helper)
    {
        if (!is_callable($helper) && ! $helper instanceof Helper) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException(
                "$name Helper is not a callable or ".
                "doesn't implement the Helper interface."
            );
        }
        $this->helpers[$name] = $helper;
    }


```
