Based on the semantic analysis, both changes aim to ensure configuration values are properly initialized. The HEAD branch sets `port` if it's null, while the other branch ensures both `host` and `port` are set using ternary assignments. The changes are compatible since:
1. The port assignment in HEAD handles null case
2. The ternary assignments handle unset values
3. The ternary port assignment is idempotent after HEAD's port assignment

Here's the resolved version:

```php
            }
            if ($this->cfg['port'] === null) {
                $this->cfg['port'] = $port;
            }
        }
        $this->cfg['host'] = isset($this->cfg['host']) ? $this->cfg['host'] : $host;
        $this->cfg['port'] = isset($this->cfg['port']) ? $this->cfg['port'] : $port;

        // choose appropriate transport
        // if 'bosh_url' cfg is defined include 0206
        if (isset($this->cfg['bosh_url'])) {
            JAXLLogger::debug("including bosh xep");
```
