```php
                $whereKey[] = $checkFields[0];
                $whereValue[] = \array_slice((array) $checkFields, 2);
                $combiner[] = \_AND;
                $extra[] = null;
            } else {
                if (!empty($checkFields[0])) {
                    $whereKey[] = $checkFields[0];
                    $whereValue[] = (isset($checkFields[2])) ? $checkFields[2] : '';
                    $combiner[] = (isset($checkFields[3])) ? $checkFields[3] : \_AND;
                    $extra[] = (isset($checkFields[4])) ? $checkFields[4] : null;
                }
```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
The conflict is resolved by keeping the `!empty()` check from HEAD, which is semantically safer than `isset()` for this context. Here's why:

1. `!empty($checkFields[0])` ensures the value is:
   - Set (prevents undefined index notice)
   - Non-empty (avoids empty string/zero/null values)
   
2. This is crucial since `$checkFields[0]` is used as a query key, where empty values could cause unexpected behavior.

3. The branch's `isset()` only checks existence but would allow empty values, which might lead to:
   - Empty WHERE clauses in SQL queries
   - Potential data integrity issues
   - Hidden bugs in query construction

The surrounding context shows `$checkFields[0]` is treated as a significant value (used in `$whereKey[]`), justifying the stricter empty-check. The ternary checks for other indexes (`[2]`, `[3]`, `[4]`) remain unchanged as they handle optional values appropriately.
