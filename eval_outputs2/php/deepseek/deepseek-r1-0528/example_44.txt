App::import('Vendor','Media.ImageMedia', array('file' => 'media'.DS.'image.php'));
App::import('Vendor','GdMediaAdapter', array('file' => 'media'.DS.'adapter'.DS.'gd.php'));

```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. **Subpackage Declaration:**  
   The branch version (`medium.adapter`) appears intentional as it matches the destination path in the branch (`tests/cases/vendors/medium/adapter`). The HEAD version (`media.adapter`) would be inconsistent with the file's new location.

2. **Copyright Year:**  
   The updated end year (2010) from the branch supersedes the older version (2009) since it represents a later timeframe.

3. **Preservation of Intent:**  
   Both changes are semantically independent - the subpackage reflects structural organization while the copyright update represents temporal information. Both can be safely merged without conflict.

4. **Path Consistency:**  
   The branch's file path (`medium/adapter`) suggests a deliberate refactoring from `media` to `medium`, making the branch's subpackage declaration more contextually appropriate.

The resolution maintains semantic consistency with the branch's structural changes while preserving the most current copyright information.
