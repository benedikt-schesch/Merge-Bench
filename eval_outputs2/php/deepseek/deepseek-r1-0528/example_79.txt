I'll resolve the merge conflict by analyzing the intent behind both changes. The conflict is about adding SQLite support to the list of supported drivers while preserving existing functionality.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```php

use Drupal\Core\Database\Database;

trait ConnectTrait
{
    protected $supportedDrivers = ['mysql', 'pgsql', 'sqlite'];

    public function resolveConnection($key = 'default', $target = 'default')
    {
        $connectionInfo = Database::getConnectionInfo($key);
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Resolution Explanation:
1. **Conflict Analysis**:  
   - HEAD branch contains `['mysql', 'pgsql']`  
   - Other branch contains `['mysql', 'pgsql', 'sqlite']`  
   - Both branches agree on supporting MySQL and PostgreSQL
   - The other branch adds SQLite support

2. **Semantic Resolution**:  
   - Adding SQLite support is an additive change that doesn't conflict with existing drivers
   - This likely represents new feature development (SQLite support) being merged into the main branch
   - The change is backwards compatible with existing functionality
   - Both branches share identical code for the `resolveConnection` method below

3. **Decision**:  
   - Combined the changes by including SQLite while preserving existing drivers
   - Maintained identical method code below since both branches match
   - Left the remaining conflict marker as requested since it's outside the given context

The resolution adds SQLite support while maintaining compatibility with the existing drivers. The method implementation remains unchanged as both branches agree on that part of the code.
