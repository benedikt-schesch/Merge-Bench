The conflict involves two different code paths being added in the same location. The HEAD branch adds a fallback call to `serveDevelopmentCollection()`, while the other branch adds error handling logic with an `else` block. Since these changes represent semantically different behaviors and there's no clear context for how they might interact, I'm returning the unresolved conflict.

```php
            {
                return $this->serveProductionCollection($collection, $group, $format);
            }
        }

<<<<<<< HEAD
        return $this->serveDevelopmentCollection($collection, $group, $format);

            return array_to_newlines($response);
        }
        else
        {
            return '<!-- Basset could not find manifest entry for collection: '.$collection->getIdentifier().' -->';
        }
