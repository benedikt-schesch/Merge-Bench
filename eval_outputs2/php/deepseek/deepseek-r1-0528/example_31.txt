Based on analyzing the intent of both changes, I've resolved the conflict by maintaining consistency with the surrounding indentation style. The conflict was purely about whitespace formatting, not logic. Here's the resolved snippet:

```php
		
        $this -> redis -> lpush("razor_clientdata", serialize($data));
        
		//For realtime User sessions
        $key = "razor_r_u_p_" . $productId . "_" . date('Y-m-d-H-i', time());
        $this -> redis -> hset($key, array($data["deviceid"] => $productId));
        $this -> redis -> expire($key, 30 * 60);

        //For realtime areas
        $key = "razor_r_arc_p_" . $productId . "_c_" . $data["country"] . "_" . date('Y-m-d-H-i', time());
        $this -> redis -> hset($key, array($data["country"] => $productId));

```

Resolution reasoning:
1. Both versions implement identical Redis operations (`hset` with same parameters)
2. The surrounding context consistently uses 8-space indentation
3. The branch version (59acc8e) matches the indentation of:
   - The `$key` declaration above
   - The `expire` call below
   - The realtime areas block
4. The HEAD version's tab-based indentation was inconsistent with the rest of the block
5. No logic changes were made - purely whitespace normalization

The conflict was automatically resolvable since it only involved non-semantic whitespace differences, not functional changes.
