Based on the provided context and semantic analysis, here's the resolved code snippet. The conflict was between two different class paths for the ScheduleService mock. The resolution selects the more specific driver implementation (`Drivers\Cron\ScheduleService`) since it appears to be the intentional change while maintaining compatibility with the subsequent service binding:

```php
            function ($m) use ($scheduledCommand, $scheduler) {
                $item = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\QueueItem');
                $item->shouldReceive('getCommand')->once()->andReturn($scheduledCommand);
                $m->shouldReceive('flush')->once()->andReturn([$item]);
            });
        $scheduleService = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Drivers\Cron\ScheduleService');
        $scheduleService->shouldReceive('getQueue')->once()->andReturn($queue);
        $this->app->instance('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService', $scheduleService);

        $commandService = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\CommandService[runnableInCurrentMaintenanceSetting,run]',
            [$scheduleService],
```

**Resolution rationale:**  
1. The branch version (`Drivers\Cron\ScheduleService`) appears to implement a more specific driver-based architecture  
2. The subsequent service binding (`::Services\ScheduleService`) remains valid since it's likely an interface/abstract binding  
3. Both implementations would satisfy the `getQueue()` method requirement  
4. The `Drivers\Cron\` path suggests intentional namespacing refinement  
5. All surrounding context and spacing is preserved exactly as provided  

The resolution maintains semantic compatibility while incorporating what appears to be an architectural improvement from the branch.
