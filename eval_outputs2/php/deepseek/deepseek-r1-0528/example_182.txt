The conflict involves adding a docblock comment for the `ANY` constant. Both branches define the constants and property identically. We resolve by keeping the docblock since it provides valuable documentation without changing behavior. The resolved code maintains the same spacing as in the incoming branch.

```php
use Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\Schedulable;

class Scheduler extends Schedulable
{
    /**
     * @var string Any of the contextual time frame
     */
    const ANY = '*';

    const NONE = '-';

    private $scheduleWeek = self::NONE;
```
