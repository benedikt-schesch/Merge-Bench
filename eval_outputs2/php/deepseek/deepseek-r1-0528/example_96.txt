The conflict involves differences in Tamil translations for time strings. Since I'm not a Tamil language expert, I can't determine which translation is more accurate or contextually appropriate. The changes appear to be semantic in nature (different Tamil phrasing) rather than functional differences in the code logic.

Both versions:
1. Test the same functionality (`ago()` method)
2. Maintain identical test structures
3. Only differ in the expected Tamil output strings

Without linguistic context to determine which translation is correct, I'm preserving the conflict markers as the intent is ambiguous. Here's the unchanged snippet:

```php
        ///

        $oneAgo = Date::parse('1 hour');
        $fiveAgo = Date::parse('5 hours');

<<<<<<< HEAD
        $this->assertEquals('1 மணி நேரம் இல்', $oneAgo->ago());
        $this->assertEquals('5 மணி நேரம் இல்', $fiveAgo->ago());
=======
        $this->assertEquals('1 மணி நேரத்தில் இல்', $oneAgo->ago());
        $this->assertEquals('5 மணி நேரத்தில் இல்', $fiveAgo->ago());

        $oneAgo = Date::parse('1 day');
        $fiveAgo = Date::parse('5 days');

```
