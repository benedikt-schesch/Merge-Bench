```php
            foreach($input_attrs as $name => $val) {
                $input_attr .= sprintf('%s="%s" ', $name, htmlspecialchars($val));
            }

            $html .= sprintf('<input %s>', $input_attr);
<<<<<<< HEAD
            $html .= sprintf('<input type="hidden" id="%s_captcha_id" name="captcha_id" value="%s">', $image_id, $captcha_id);

        }

        return $html;
    }


```

The conflict remains unresolved due to ambiguous intent:
1. The HEAD version adds a hidden captcha field which appears critical for security/functionality
2. The other branch completely removes this field, suggesting it might be obsolete or relocated
3. Without broader context about captcha implementation, it's unclear whether:
   - The hidden field is still needed
   - Captcha handling was moved elsewhere
   - This represents a security vulnerability if removed

Since the semantics and requirements behind both changes are unclear, the conflict markers are preserved for manual resolution.
