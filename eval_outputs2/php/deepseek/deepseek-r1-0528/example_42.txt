The conflict arises from differences in the `@subpackage` and `@copyright` annotations. Here's the resolution:

1. **`@subpackage`**  
   The HEAD version uses `media.libs.media` while the other branch uses `media.libs.medium`. Since the file path in the conflict marker (`vendors/media/audio.php` vs. `vendors/medium/audio.php`) suggests a structural difference, and the current context (HEAD) places the file in `media/`, we retain `media.libs.media` to match the current directory structure.

2. **`@copyright`**  
   The other branch updates the end year to `2010`, which is a straightforward improvement over `2009`. This change is preserved.

Resolution:  
Keep `@subpackage` from HEAD and `@copyright` from the other branch.
