The conflict arises from one branch adding a `tearDown()` method while the other branch adds a test method. The resolution integrates both changes by placing the `tearDown()` method before the test method since they serve different purposes and are both valid additions to the test class. The `tearDown()` method handles cleanup after each test, while `testDefaultDriver()` contains a specific test case. 

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```php
use Config;
use TestCase;

class TestConfig extends TestCase
{
    public function tearDown()
    {
        parent::tearDown();
        m::close();
    }

    public function testDefaultDriver()
    {
        $this->assertEquals(Config::get('dispatcher::driver'), 'dateTime');
    }


```
