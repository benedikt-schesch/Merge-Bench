The conflict occurs in the "removeUser" action block. The HEAD version adds a password verification step before removing a user, while the other branch version removes this check. Since password verification is a critical security measure for destructive operations like user removal, I've preserved the HEAD version's intent. The resolved code maintains the password check while keeping the removal logic intact.

```php

		} else if ($action === "getOfflinePerm") {
			$openedPerm = openFile("$directory/$groupName/$userName/offlinePerm.txt", 50000);
			echo json_encode($openedPerm);
		} else if ($action === "removeUser") {
			
			$userToRemovePass = openFile("$directory/$groupName/$userName/pass.txt", 50000);
			if ($userToRemovePass === $clientData) {
			//remove user directory
			delete_files("$directory/$groupName/$userName/");

			//remove from user list
			$users = openFile("$directory/$groupName/userlist.txt", 500000);
```
