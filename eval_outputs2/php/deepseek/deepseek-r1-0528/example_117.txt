The conflict arises from differences in whitespace formatting and indentation while the core functionality remains the same. Here's the resolved version preserving contextual whitespace while maintaining semantic integrity:

```php
          return PclZip::errorCode();
        }

        // ----- Read the file content
        $v_content = '';
        if ($p_header['size'] > 0) {
          $v_content = @fread($v_file, $p_header['size']);
        }
        // ----- Close the file
        @fclose($v_file);

        // ----- Calculate the CRC
```

Resolution logic:
1. Preserved condition spacing from branch (`if (` instead of `if(`) for readability
2. Kept 2-space body indentation from HEAD (matches surrounding 2-space format)
3. Removed trailing empty line from HEAD to avoid spacing inconsistencies
4. Maintained all non-conflicting context unchanged
5. Behavior is identical to both conflict versions - reads file content if size > 0

The solution balances the branch's improved syntax with HEAD's indentation consistency, ensuring functionality remains unchanged while fitting existing code style.
