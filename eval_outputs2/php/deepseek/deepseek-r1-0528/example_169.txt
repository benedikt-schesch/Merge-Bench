I've analyzed the merge conflict in the docblock. The conflict involves two changes:
1. HEAD branch updates the return type to `bool|\WP_Error`
2. Other branch adds access modifier `@access private` and uses `bool|WP_Error` return type

The conflict is resolvable because:
- Removing `@access private` is correct since the method is declared public
- Using fully-qualified `\WP_Error` is more precise than unqualified `WP_Error`
- Both changes can be semantically merged by keeping the return type from HEAD and omitting the incorrect access modifier

Resolved version preserves HEAD's return type annotation while removing the contradictory access modifier from the other branch:

```php
	/**
	 * Validate a reCAPTCHA field.
	 *
	 * @param bool $success
	 *
	 * @return bool|\WP_Error
	 */
	public function validate_recaptcha_field( $success ) {
		$recaptcha_field_label = get_option( 'job_manager_recaptcha_label' );

		// translators: %s is the name of the form validation that failed.
```
