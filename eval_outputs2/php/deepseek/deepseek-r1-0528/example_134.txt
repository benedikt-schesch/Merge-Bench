I notice this merge conflict involves two different approaches to handling a warning message when the Laravel installer fails to automatically register API routes. After analyzing both versions:

1. The HEAD version includes:
   - A specific file path in the warning (`{$appBootstrapPath}`)
   - A `return` statement after the warning
   
2. The other branch uses:
   - A generic "bootstrap file" message
   - No `return` statement

The conflict appears ambiguous because:
- The file path in HEAD provides valuable debugging context
- The presence/absence of `return` significantly changes control flow
- Without seeing the full function context, I can't determine if the `return` is necessary

Since I can't confidently reconcile these semantic differences, I'm returning the original conflicted snippet:

```php
                'web: __DIR__.\'/../routes/web.php\',',
                'web: __DIR__.\'/../routes/web.php\','.PHP_EOL.'        api: __DIR__.\'/../routes/api.php\',',
                $appBootstrapPath,
            );
        } else {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            $this->components->warn("Unable to automatically add API route definition to [{$appBootstrapPath}]. API route file should be registered manually.");

            return;
=======
            $this->components->warn('Unable to automatically add API route definition to bootstrap file. API route file should be registered manually.');
