Based on the semantic context, the version constant should likely retain the development branch value (`13.x-dev`) in the HEAD as it represents the current development path, while the conflicting value (`12.18.0`) likely comes from a stable branch. Here's the resolved snippet:

```php
    /**
     * The Laravel framework version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    const VERSION = '13.x-dev';

    /**
     * The base path for the Laravel installation.
     *
     * @var string

```

**Resolution rationale:**  
The version constant typically reflects the branch's progression state. Since `HEAD` contains a development version marker (`13.x-dev`), we prioritize it over the stable release version (`12.18.0`) from the other branch, preserving the active development context. If a release is being prepared, this should be handled through explicit version-bumping workflows, not a merge conflict resolution.
