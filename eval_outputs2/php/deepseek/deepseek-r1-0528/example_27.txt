Here's the resolved snippet based on semantic analysis of both changes:

```php
<?php

// Database Details
define('SERVERNAME','localhost');
define('SERVERPORT','3306');
define('DBUSERNAME','your_db_username_here');
define('DBPASSWORD','your_db_password_here');
define('DBNAME','your_db_name_here');

Define('ANSWERS_PER_PAGE','10');
define('QUESTIONS_PER_PAGE','10');

//if you want to enable production mode vs debug mode (useful for error reporting)

```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. Both branches agree on placeholder values for credentials
2. The other branch (`3b68aa2`) provides more explicit placeholders with "_here" suffix
3. The database name should remain a placeholder (consistent with other credentials)
4. Placeholder values should be explicit to indicate they require user configuration
5. Maintains consistency in credential definitions while preserving configuration intent

The resolution keeps all placeholder values explicit and consistent while maintaining identical surrounding context.
