I've analyzed the merge conflict and determined that both changes are semantically important. The branch version adds a safeguard against division by zero when `$captcha_text` has only 1 character, which is a critical improvement. Here's the resolved code:

```php
        }
        if (mt_rand(0, 99) % 2 == 1) {
            $angleN = -$angleN;
        }

        $step   = abs($angle0 - $angleN) / (max(1, $this->strlen($captcha_text) - 1));
        $step   = ($angle0 > $angleN) ? -$step : $step;
        $angle  = $angle0;

        for ($c = 0; $c < $this->strlen($captcha_text); ++$c) {
            $font     = $this->ttfFile(); // select random font from list for this character
```

Key resolution points:
1. Kept the branch version's `max(1, ...)` wrapper to prevent division by zero when text length is 1
2. Preserved HEAD's variable assignments and spacing exactly
3. Maintained all surrounding context without modifications
4. The solution handles both cases:
   - For length ≥ 2: Uses normal step calculation
   - For length 1: Uses `max(1, 0)` → 1 to avoid division by zero
   - For length 0: Uses `max(1, -1)` → 1 (safe, though unlikely in captchas)
