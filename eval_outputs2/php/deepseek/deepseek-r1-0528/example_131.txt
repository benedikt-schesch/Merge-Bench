The conflict arises between two different version specifications for the Laravel framework. The HEAD branch sets the version to `13.x-dev` (indicating development for the next major version), while the other branch sets it to `12.19.3` (a stable release). Since version constants are mutually exclusive and their values depend on the project's lifecycle stage **(development vs. stable)**, it's impossible to automatically determine the correct version without project context. 

Both versions serve different purposes, and choosing one would require understanding the current release strategy or feature branch intent. Therefore, manual resolution is necessary.

**Output with preserved conflict:**
```php
    /**
     * The Laravel framework version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const VERSION = '13.x-dev';
=======
    const VERSION = '12.19.3';
>>>>>>> 4e6ec689ef704bb4bd282f29d9dd658dfb4fb262

    /**
     * The base path for the Laravel installation.
     *
     * @var string
```
