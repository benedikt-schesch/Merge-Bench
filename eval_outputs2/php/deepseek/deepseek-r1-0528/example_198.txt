```php

    /**
     * @param \Phake\IMock|class-string $object
     */
    public function __construct(
        \Phake\IMock|string $object,
        string $method,
        ?\Phake\Matchers\IChainableArgumentMatcher $argumentMatcher,
        IVerifierMode $verificationMode
    ) {
        $this->object           = $object;
        $this->method           = $method;

```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
The conflict involves parameter type declarations. The HEAD branch adds type hints (`\Phake\IMock|string` and `string`) while the other branch uses untyped parameters. The docblock already specifies `@param \Phake\IMock|class-string $object` which aligns perfectly with the HEAD version's type declaration. The `string` type for `$method` is semantically correct since method names are strings. Preserving the type declarations improves type safety and maintains consistency with the existing docblock. The surrounding context remains unchanged as requested.
