The merge conflict involves two different approaches for the response message in the `set` action block. The HEAD branch returns a fixed JSON object `{"cenInfo":"set"}`, while the other branch returns a dynamic JSON-encoded string containing the username and groupname. 

Since these are semantically different responses (fixed status vs. detailed confirmation) and we lack context about client expectations, I've preserved the conflict as the intent is ambiguous. The surrounding code remains unchanged.

```php
>>>>>>> 932edc459d685aded53c1b84a268053b59f506be

		} else if ($action === "set") {

			saveFile("$directory/$groupName/$userName/data.txt", $clientData);
<<<<<<< HEAD
			echo '{"cenInfo":"set"}';
=======
			echo json_encode("saved to user " . $userName . " in group " . $groupName);
>>>>>>> 932edc459d685aded53c1b84a268053b59f506be

		} else if ($action === "permissions") {
			if ($userName !== "default") {//make sure no permissions are set on default user
				$read = $_POST['read'];
				$write = $_POST['write'];
```
