```php
    const BACKTRACE_LEVEL = 'backtrace_level';

    /**
     * @var string
     */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const LOG_TYPE_LOG = 'log';
=======
    const BASE_PATH = 'base_path';

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    const LOG = 'log';
>>>>>>> 3d1bd4d7bd5244a6ab1bedeb2057feeb42574ae5

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    const LOG_TYPE_WARN = 'warn';

```

**Reasoning for keeping conflict:**  
The intent is ambiguous because:
1. Both sides are adding different constants (`LOG_TYPE_LOG` vs `BASE_PATH` and `LOG`)
2. The constant `LOG` from the other branch might be semantically related to `LOG_TYPE_LOG` from HEAD (both contain 'log'), but their naming patterns differ significantly
3. The purpose of `LOG` vs `LOG_TYPE_LOG` is unclear without broader context
4. Adding all three constants might cause duplication or logical conflicts
5. The `LOG` constant appears in the same position where `LOG_TYPE_LOG` is defined in HEAD, suggesting possible renaming intent

Since we can't determine whether:
- The constants serve different purposes and should coexist
- `LOG` is meant to replace `LOG_TYPE_LOG`
- The naming differences are intentional

The conflict requires human judgment to resolve.
