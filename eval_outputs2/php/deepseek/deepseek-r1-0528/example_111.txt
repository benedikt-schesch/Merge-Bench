The conflict arises due to differing array syntax and content between the two branches. The solution combines both intents by preserving the modern square bracket array syntax from the HEAD while incorporating the 'custom' driver addition from the other branch. This maintains consistency with later code that references the 'custom' driver option.

```php
        $treeBuilder = new TreeBuilder();

        /** @var ArrayNodeDefinition $rootNode */
        $rootNode = $treeBuilder->root('fos_oauth_server');

        $supportedDrivers = ['orm', 'mongodb', 'propel', 'custom'];

        $rootNode
            ->validate()
                ->always(function($v) {
                    if ('custom' !== $v['db_driver']) {

```
