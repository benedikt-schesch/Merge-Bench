**Resolution Explanation:**  
The conflict remains unresolved because the intent is ambiguous. Both sides aim to initialize `JAXLEvent` with either `[$this]` or `[]`, but they use different conditionals:
1. **HEAD version** uses `$this->cfg['multi_client']` (runtime configuration)  
2. **Branch version** uses `defined('JAXL_MULTI_CLIENT')` (compile-time constant)  

Without broader context about whether the project uses configuration arrays or constants for feature flags, this conflict requires human decision. Possible resolutions:
1. Keep HEAD version if configuration-driven features are preferred
2. Keep branch version if constant-based feature flags are standard
3. Combine both checks if needed (e.g., `($this->cfg['multi_client'] || defined('JAXL_MULTI_CLIENT'))`)

Since intent isn't clear from the snippet alone, the conflict is preserved.
