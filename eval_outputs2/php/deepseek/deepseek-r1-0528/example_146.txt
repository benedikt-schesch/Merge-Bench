The merge conflict arises from differing import statements between the two branches. The `HEAD` branch has no additional imports, while the other branch adds three Doctrine-related imports. Since these imports don't conflict with existing Go\Aop imports and serve different purposes, we should include all imports to preserve functionality from both branches. The Doctrine imports are placed first for better organization.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```php
 * with this source code in the file LICENSE.
 */

namespace Go\Core;

use Doctrine\Common\Annotations\AnnotationReader;
use Doctrine\Common\Annotations\PsrCachedReader;
use Doctrine\Common\Cache as DoctrineCache;
use Go\Aop\Advisor;
use Go\Aop\Aspect;
use Go\Aop\Pointcut;
use Go\Aop\Pointcut\PointcutGrammar;
use Go\Aop\Pointcut\PointcutLexer;

```
