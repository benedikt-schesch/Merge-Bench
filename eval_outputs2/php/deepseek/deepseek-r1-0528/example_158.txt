I've analyzed the merge conflict and found that the intent is ambiguous. Both sides are making significant changes to the `getPrefixes()` method while also modifying different aspects of the class structure. Without more context about the class properties (`$prefixes`, `$prefixesPsr0`, `$prefixDirsPsr4`) and how they're used elsewhere, I can't safely determine the correct resolution.

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```php
    private $useIncludePath = false;
    private $classMap = array();

    public function getPrefixes()
    {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        return $this->prefixes;
=======
        return call_user_func_array('array_merge', $this->prefixesPsr0);
    }

    public function getPrefixesPsr4()
    {
        return $this->prefixDirsPsr4;
>>>>>>> af25d22af4fc32920cf7d332f16e832e79ac6915
    }

    public function getFallbackDirs()
    {
        return $this->fallbackDirsPsr0;
```

Key reasons for not resolving:
1. The HEAD version uses a simple property return (`$prefixes`), while the other branch introduces PSR-0 specific merging logic
2. The other branch adds a completely new method `getPrefixesPsr4()` which doesn't exist in HEAD
3. There's no context about whether `$prefixesPsr0` and `$prefixDirsPsr4` exist in both versions
4. The relationship between `$prefixes` (HEAD) and `$prefixesPsr0` (other branch) is unclear
5. The class seems to be undergoing significant autoloader-related changes that require deeper understanding

A human developer should resolve this by:
1. Checking if the class should support PSR-4 autoloading
2. Verifying existence of all referenced properties
3. Determining if `getPrefixes()` should return PSR-0 specific data or combined data
4. Deciding whether the new `getPrefixesPsr4()` method belongs in the final implementation
