Since the intent behind the conflicting imports is ambiguous without seeing the full class implementation, I cannot safely resolve this conflict. The additional imports from HEAD might be required for functionality elsewhere in the class, or they might be unused. Without seeing the actual usage of `Application`, `Str`, and `InvalidArgumentException` in the class body, I must retain the conflict markers.

```php

use Illuminate\Foundation\AliasLoader;
use Collective\Html\FormBuilder as LaravelForm;
use Collective\Html\HtmlBuilder;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
<<<<<<< HEAD
use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use InvalidArgumentException;
=======

use Kris\LaravelFormBuilder\Form;

class FormBuilderServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
