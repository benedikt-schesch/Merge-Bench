The merge conflict involves incompatible changes to the class declaration structure. The HEAD version uses inheritance (`extends LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase`) while the other branch uses a standalone class declaration. Since these changes represent conflicting semantic intents (inheritance vs no inheritance) and we lack context to determine which should prevail, the conflict must be preserved.

```php
namespace Mcamara\LaravelLocalization\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse;

<<<<<<< HEAD
class LocaleSessionRedirect extends LaravelLocalizationMiddlewareBase {

=======
class LocaleSessionRedirect
{

     * @param \Closure                 $next
