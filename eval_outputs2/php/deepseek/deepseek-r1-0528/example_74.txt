The conflict arises from differing version definitions between the two branches. The HEAD branch marks a stable release (`1.6.3`), while the other branch indicates a development version (`1.7.0-dev`). Since this is a semantic conflict about the *actual version state* of the application, and there's no contextual information about which version should take precedence, the conflict remains unresolved. 

The version constant must represent a single unambiguous state (either stable or dev), and without knowing which branch's intent should prevail, manual resolution is required. Here's the unchanged snippet:

```php
    /**
     * The Flarum version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const VERSION = '1.6.3';
=======
    const VERSION = '1.7.0-dev';
>>>>>>> d5e6f6db5f24e28da3f2574dd861cd747c460fbb

    /**
     * The IoC container for the Flarum application.
     *
     * @var Container

```
