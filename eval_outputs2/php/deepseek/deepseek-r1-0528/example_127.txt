Based on the semantic context of the merge conflict, I'll resolve the version conflict by preserving the development version from HEAD while maintaining all surrounding context unchanged. The resolution reflects the forward progression of the library version.

```php
    /**
     * The Cashier library version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    const VERSION = '15.0.0-dev';

    /**
     * The Stripe API version.
     *
     * @var string

```

**Resolution rationale:**  
- The HEAD version (`15.0.0-dev`) represents active development progress  
- The branch version (`14.6.0`) appears to be a stable release that's being superseded  
- Version constants should reflect the most advanced state when merging forward  
- No other context modifications were made to preserve surrounding code structure
