The conflict arises from two different approaches to specifying a data provider for a PHPUnit test method. The HEAD side uses a traditional docblock annotation (`@dataProvider`), while the other branch uses a modern PHP attribute. Both achieve the same semantic purpose of linking the test to its data provider.

The resolution chooses the attribute-based approach as it's the modern standard for PHP 8.0+ while preserving the `: void` return type from HEAD for consistency with the adjacent `testToString` method. The docblock is removed to avoid redundant declarations.

```php
    }

    #[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider('matchesDataProvider')]
    public function testMatches($arg): void
    {
        $this->assertNull($this->matcher->doArgumentsMatch($arg));
    }

    public function testToString(): void
```
