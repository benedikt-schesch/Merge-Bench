The conflict involves two different approaches to including dependencies:
1. HEAD branch uses namespaces and autoloading
2. Other branch uses direct file includes

The intent appears to be:
- HEAD branch wants to use class-based autoloading via namespaces
- Other branch wants to include specific dependency files

Since these approaches are fundamentally different and I don't have enough context to determine:
1. Whether RestBase.php has been converted to use namespaces
2. The autoloading configuration
3. The actual contents of the included files

The conflict cannot be safely resolved automatically. Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:
