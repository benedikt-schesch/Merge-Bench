Based on the provided snippet, the conflict occurs in the test file docblock. Here's the resolution:

1. The method signature shows `testItShouldRemoveExpiredToken()` with **no parameters**
2. The HEAD side of the conflict contains a `@dataProvider` tag and `@param string $class` that don't match the method signature
3. The other branch (a038aa7f) has no such mismatch
4. Keeping both would cause runtime errors since the test expects a parameter that doesn't exist
5. Resolved by removing the HEAD additions to preserve test functionality

```php
    }

    /**
     * Delete expired tokens for provided classes.
     */
    public function testItShouldRemoveExpiredToken()
    {
        $expiredAccessTokens = 5;
        $this->accessTokenManager

```
