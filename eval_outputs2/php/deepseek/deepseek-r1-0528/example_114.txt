Based on the provided code snippet with merge conflict, I have analyzed both changes while preserving the surrounding context exactly as provided. Both changes relate to the `EXTRA_VERSION` constant value, but there is ambiguity about which version string ("rc2-dev" vs "rc2") should be used. Since the surrounding context doesn't provide additional semantic clues to determine the correct version and both versions could be valid depending on the development/release workflow, I'm keeping the conflict unresolved as required.

Here is the exact output preserving all spacing and conflict markers:

```php
     * For example, for 3.8.0 when this is set to 'dev' the version string will be `3.8.0-dev`.
     *
     * @var    string
     * @since  3.8.0
     */
