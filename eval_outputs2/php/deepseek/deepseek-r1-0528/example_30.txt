```php
        $this->load->model('servicepublicclass/clientdatapublic', 'clientdatapublic');
        $clientdata = new clientdatapublic();
        $clientdata->loadclientdata($content);
		
        $productId = $this -> utility -> getProductIdByKey($clientdata -> appkey);
        
        $ip = $this -> utility -> getOnlineIP();
        $nowtime = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
        if (isset($clientdata -> time)) {
            $nowtime = $clientdata -> time;
```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
The conflict was purely about whitespace formatting (presence/absence of a blank line after the `$productId` assignment). Since:
1. Both branches had identical functional code
2. The blank line doesn't affect functionality
3. The surrounding context shows consistent use of blank lines for visual separation (e.g., between `loadclientdata` and `$productId`)

The resolution preserves the blank line to maintain consistency with the surrounding code style while eliminating the conflict markers. No semantic changes were made.
