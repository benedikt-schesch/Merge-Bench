**Resolution Reasoning:**  
Both versions of the conflict contain identical translation text. The only difference is the text domain (`custom-post-type-ui` vs `custom_post_type_ui`). Since the surrounding context consistently uses `'custom-post-type-ui'` and this matches WordPress plugin slug conventions (hyphens vs underscores), we resolved to use the hyphenated version for consistency throughout the file. The semantic intent of both branches is identical.
