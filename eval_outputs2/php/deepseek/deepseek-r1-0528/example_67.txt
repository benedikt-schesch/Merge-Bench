Based on the semantic analysis, both sides of the merge are trying to update the plugin's version number. The conflict arises from HEAD updating to `1.7.2` while the other branch has `1.7.1`. Since version numbers are sequential and HEAD represents the most recent change, it should be preferred. Here's the resolved snippet:

```php
