```php
						$userFoundInP = true;
					}
				}
				if ($userFoundInP === true || $openedWrite === "allowAll") {
					saveFile("$directory/$groupName/$otherUser/data.txt", $clientData);
					echo json_encode(array("cenInfo" => "saved to user $otherUser in group $groupName"));
				} else {
					echo '{"cenError":"write access not granted."}';
				}
			} else {
				echo '{"cenError":"user does not exist."}';
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. **Semantic Intent:** Both branches aim to report a successful save operation:
   - HEAD uses a simple JSON confirmation `{"cenInfo":"set"}`
   - Incoming branch provides detailed feedback with `json_encode("saved to user...")`
   
2. **Resolution Strategy:**
   - Preserve the structured JSON format from HEAD (`cenInfo` key)
   - Incorporate the detailed message from the incoming branch
   - Use `json_encode` for proper escaping and consistency

3. **Result:** Combines both intents by:
   - Keeping the `cenInfo` structure (HEAD's pattern)
   - Adding user/group details (incoming branch's value)
   - Maintaining JSON response consistency with other messages

The solution retains the semantic meaning of both branches while ensuring output consistency with surrounding error messages.
