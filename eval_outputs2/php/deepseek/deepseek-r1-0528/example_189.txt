Here's the resolved snippet with the conflict resolved by keeping the HEAD version, as it aligns with the subsequent container binding:

```php
            function ($m) use ($scheduledCommand, $scheduler) {
                $item = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\QueueItem');
                $item->shouldReceive('getCommand')->once()->andReturn($scheduledCommand);
                $m->shouldReceive('flush')->once()->andReturn([$item]);
            });
        $scheduleService = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService');
        $scheduleService->shouldReceive('getQueue')->once()->andReturn($queue);
        $this->app->instance('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService', $scheduleService);

        $commandService = m::mock('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\CommandService[runnableInEnvironment,run]',
            [$scheduleService]);
```

**Resolution Rationale:**  
The HEAD version (`Services\ScheduleService`) is preserved because it matches both:
1. The subsequent service binding (`$this->app->instance('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService', ...)`)
2. The type expected by `CommandService`'s dependencies in the following lines.  

The other branch (`Drivers\Cron\ScheduleService`) introduces ambiguity since the container binds to the `Services\ScheduleService` interface/class, and there's no evidence that `CommandService` expects this implementation. Keeping HEAD ensures type consistency with the container and services referenced elsewhere in the snippet.
