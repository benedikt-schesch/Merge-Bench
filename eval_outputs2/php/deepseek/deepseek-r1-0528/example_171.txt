use App;

use Indatus\Dispatcher\Debugger;
use Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\ScheduledCommand;
use Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\ScheduledCommandInterface;

class CommandService
{
    /**

```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
Both sides contribute necessary imports for command dispatching functionality. The merged result:
1. Keeps `App` and `Illuminate\Console\Command` (common to both)
2. Adds `Run` from the feature branch (new functionality)
3. Retains `Debugger` (common to both)
4. Adds `ScheduledCommand` from the feature branch (new functionality)
5. Preserves `ScheduledCommandInterface` (existing in both versions post-conflict)

This satisfies both branches' requirements by including:
- HEAD's `Debugger`  
- Feature branch's `Run` and `ScheduledCommand`  
- Common interface requirement `ScheduledCommandInterface`  
All while maintaining proper import structure without duplication.
