I've analyzed the conflict and determined that the line added in HEAD (`$this->prefixes[$prefix] = (array) $paths;`) is likely unintentional in this PSR-4 registration context. The conflict markers can be safely removed as the PSR-4 handling logic appears complete without this line.

Here's the resolved snippet maintaining all context and spacing:

```php
                throw new \InvalidArgumentException("A non-empty PSR-4 prefix must end with a namespace separator.");
            }
            $this->prefixLengthsPsr4[$prefix[0]][$prefix] = $length;
            $this->prefixDirsPsr4[$prefix] = (array) $paths;
        }
    }

    /**
     * Turns on searching the include path for class files.
