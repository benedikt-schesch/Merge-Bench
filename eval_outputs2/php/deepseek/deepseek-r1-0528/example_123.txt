Based on the context and semantic analysis, I've resolved the conflict by maintaining consistency with the function's brace style. The surrounding context shows the function declaration uses an opening brace on a new line, so I've selected the merge version that maintains this consistent style for the `if` statement.

Here's the resolved code:

```php
     * @param  string $value
     * @return mixed
     */
    protected function hasRelationshipAttribute($value)
    {
        if (is_string($value) && preg_match('/^factory:(.+)$/i', $value, $matches))
        {
            return $matches[1];
        }

        return false;
    }

```
