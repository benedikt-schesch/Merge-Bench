The conflict arises from two different approaches to binding the `ScheduleService` class. The HEAD version uses `$this->app->bind` which is the standard Laravel service provider method, while the other branch uses the `App` facade. The extra closing brace in the HEAD version is necessary for correct class structure, as the subsequent comment block is clearly positioned outside the current registration method.

Resolution: Use the idiomatic service provider binding syntax and preserve the closing brace to maintain proper class structure.

```php
            return $resolver->resolveSchedulerClass();
        });

        //load the schedule service of the appropriate driver
        $this->app->bind('Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\ScheduleService', function () use ($resolver) {
            return $resolver->resolveServiceClass();
        });
    }

    /**
     * Register the service provider.
     *
     * @codeCoverageIgnore
