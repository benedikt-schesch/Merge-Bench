The conflict arises from different PHPUnit exception testing methods. The `HEAD` version uses the modern `expectException` and `expectExceptionMessage` methods, while the other branch uses the legacy `setExpectedException` method. Both methods achieve the same goal, but the modern approach is preferred for compatibility with recent PHPUnit versions.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```php
            ->expects($this->at(0))
            ->method('getUser')
            ->willReturn(null)
        ;

        $this->expectException(AccessDeniedException::class);
        $this->expectExceptionMessage('This user does not have access to this section.');

        $this->instance->authorizeAction($this->request);
    }

    public function testAuthorizeActionWillRenderTemplate()
```

Key resolution points:
1. The conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> ...`) are removed
2. The modern PHPUnit exception method (`expectException` + `expectExceptionMessage`) is preferred
3. All spacing and surrounding context remains unchanged
4. The resolved code maintains the same functionality as both approaches
5. The syntax is corrected (removed orphaned parenthesis from legacy method)
