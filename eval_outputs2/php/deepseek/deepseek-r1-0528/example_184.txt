Since the intent behind the parameter type is ambiguous (one side specifies `int|array` while the other uses `mixed`), and the context doesn't provide enough information about `parseTimeParameter()`'s expected behavior, the conflict cannot be safely resolved. The original snippet with the conflict is preserved below:

```php
        return $this;
    }

    /**
     * Set the minutes under which this command will run
<<<<<<< HEAD:src/Indatus/Dispatcher/Drivers/DateTime/Scheduler.php
     * @param  int|array $minutesIntoTheHour
=======
     * @param  mixed $minutesIntoTheHour
>>>>>>> 8a08444b80550a21aa79eb24c96872111fe9cd01:src/Indatus/Dispatcher/Drivers/Cron/Scheduler.php
     * @return $this
     */
    public function minutes($minutesIntoTheHour)
    {
        $this->setScheduleMinute($this->parseTimeParameter($minutesIntoTheHour));

```
