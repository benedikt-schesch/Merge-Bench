**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. Both `Artisan` (from HEAD) and `Illuminate\Contracts\Console\Kernel` (from branch) are valid imports serving different purposes:
   - `Artisan` is typically a Laravel facade for console commands
   - `Console\Kernel` is a contract interface for console operations
2. The imports are semantically compatible and serve different purposes
3. Alphabetical ordering is maintained in the import block (`Artisan` comes before `Illuminate`)
4. No functionality conflict exists - both can coexist without issues
5. The resolution preserves both changes while maintaining proper PHP syntax

The merge conflict is resolved by keeping both imports since they represent additive changes rather than mutually exclusive modifications.
