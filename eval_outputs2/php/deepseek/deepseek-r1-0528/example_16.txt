**Resolution Explanation:**  
The conflict involves two different version definitions (`25.4-RC4` vs `25.3.1`). Since the comment explicitly states that *"nobody should be able to overrule the real version number"* and the version number is critical for functionality, **this conflict cannot be automatically resolved**. 

The choice between versions depends on external context:
1. `25.4-RC4` suggests a pre-release version (likely from a development branch)
2. `25.3.1` represents a stable patch version

A human must decide which version accurately reflects the merged codebase state. Retain the conflict markers until manual resolution.
