The merge conflict arises from differing import statements between branches. Both sides share two common imports (`ScheduledCommandInterface` and `CommandService`), while the incoming branch adds an additional import (`ScheduledCommand`). Since this new import doesn't conflict with existing ones and appears to be intentionally added, it should be preserved while maintaining the existing imports.

Here's the resolved snippet:

use Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\ScheduledCommand;
use Indatus\Dispatcher\Scheduling\ScheduledCommandInterface;
use Indatus\Dispatcher\Services\CommandService;

class BackgroundProcessRunner
{
