Based on the context provided, I've resolved the conflict by choosing the branch version. The function `cptui_about_page_newsletter_form()` appears to be a more specific implementation that matches the surrounding context of being in an about page handler. Here's the resolved version:

```php
	}

	?>
	<h3><?php esc_html_e( 'Stay informed', 'custom-post-type-ui' ); ?></h3>
	<?php
	cptui_about_page_newsletter_form();

	return '';
}
add_action( 'cptui_main_page_before_changelog', 'cptui_about_page_newsletter' );
```

Key reasoning:
1. The function name `cptui_about_page_newsletter_form()` is more semantically aligned with the about page context
2. The branch commit (87a406b) likely introduced a refactored implementation
3. Both versions appear to serve the same purpose (displaying a newsletter form)
4. The more specific implementation reduces potential naming conflicts

The resolution maintains the exact spacing and context of the original snippet while resolving the semantic conflict.
