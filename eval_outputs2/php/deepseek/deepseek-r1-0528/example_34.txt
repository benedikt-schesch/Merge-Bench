```php

            if (!$mb_support) {
                return false;
            }

<<<<<<< HEAD
            $strpos_func     = 'mb_strpos';
=======
>>>>>>> 179182bb93543e6fafb1ada2bbdd57fad9b84ea3
            $strtolower_func = 'mb_strtolower';
        }

        $fp = fopen($this->wordlist_file, 'rb');
        if (!$fp) return false;

```

**Reasoning:**  
The conflict shows two incompatible changes:
1. HEAD branch adds `$strpos_func = 'mb_strpos'`
2. Other branch completely removes this line  

Since there's no surrounding context showing how `$strpos_func` is used later, and we can't determine if this variable is still needed or was intentionally removed, the conflict is ambiguous. The semantic intent behind the removal vs. retention can't be verified with the given snippet.  

Best practice is to preserve the conflict markers for manual resolution when intent can't be reliably inferred. The surrounding context remains unchanged as instructed.
