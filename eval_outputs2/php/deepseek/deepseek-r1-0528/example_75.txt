The conflict arises from differing version numbers between branches. The HEAD branch represents ongoing development (`1.7.0-dev`), while the other branch reflects a stable release (`1.6.2`). Since the HEAD version indicates active development work, it should be preserved to maintain accurate version tracking. The resolved snippet keeps the development version while maintaining surrounding context.

```php
    /**
     * The Flarum version.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    const VERSION = '1.7.0-dev';

    /**
     * The IoC container for the Flarum application.
     *
     * @var Container

```
