Based on the semantic conflict in version identifiers and commit references, I'm unable to automatically resolve this conflict as it represents two different development states. The intent appears ambiguous without knowing which branch should take precedence.

Here's the unchanged snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php
<?php return array(
    'root' => array(
        'name' => 'afragen/git-updater',
<<<<<<< HEAD
        'pretty_version' => 'dev-develop',
        'version' => 'dev-develop',
        'reference' => '0551b99775a83a964d8204d2946a0e772053360e',
=======
        'pretty_version' => 'dev-master',
        'version' => 'dev-master',
        'reference' => 'c18b9a2172809b787403f0aa29980a9cb5b1fd85',
>>>>>>> 1f08c7d2378ad81007e122dc86c62c3adcf79bb1
        'type' => 'wordpress-plugin',
        'install_path' => __DIR__ . '/../../',
        'aliases' => array(),
        'dev' => true,
    ),
```

This conflict requires manual resolution to determine whether:
1. The `dev-develop` branch with reference `0551b997...` should be kept
2. The `dev-master` branch with reference `c18b9a21...` should be kept
3. Or if these should be replaced with a completely new version identifier

The surrounding context remains unchanged as requested.
