The conflict involves two different approaches to handling the `$limit` parameter and a change in the second argument passed to `_makeCall`. Since the boolean flag change (from `true` to `false`) is significant and its purpose isn't clear from the context, I cannot safely resolve this conflict without understanding the implications of changing this parameter. 

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php
   * @param integer [optional] $limit     Limit of returned results
   *
   * @return mixed
   */
  public function getTagMedia($name, $limit = 0) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return $this->_makeCall('tags/' . $name . '/media/recent', true, array('count' => $limit));
=======
    $params = array();
    if ($limit > 0) {
      $params['count'] = $limit;
    }
    return $this->_makeCall('tags/' . $name . '/media/recent', false, $params);
>>>>>>> a3b515cec752dc61c3ae8b357a33ee90a016c54b
  }

  /**
   * Get a list of users who have liked this media.
   *
```

**Reasons for preserving the conflict:**
1. The boolean flag (`true` vs `false`) likely controls critical behavior (e.g., authentication/API mode)
2. The parameter handling logic differs significantly (always include `count` vs conditionally include)
3. Without knowing the purpose of the boolean in `_makeCall`, merging could break functionality
4. The two changes are semantically interdependent

A human developer should resolve this by:
1. Checking the implementation of `_makeCall` to understand the boolean parameter
2. Testing both versions to see which meets current requirements
3. Possibly combining the conditional parameter logic with the correct boolean value
