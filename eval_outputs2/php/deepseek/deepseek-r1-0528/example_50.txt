The conflict involves two changes:
1. The `@subpackage` declaration differs between branches - one uses `media.libs.media.adapter` while the other uses `media.libs.medium.adapter`
2. The copyright year is updated from `2007-2009` to `2007-2010` in one branch

The intent behind the copyright year update is clear - it's a simple update to reflect the most recent year. However, the package structure change (`media` vs `medium`) appears to be a structural change that affects the code's organization. Since there's no additional context to determine which package structure is correct, and these changes represent conflicting semantic intents, the conflict cannot be automatically resolved.

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:
