The conflict arises from an empty line added in HEAD versus no changes in the other branch. The semantic intent suggests that the empty line is harmless (used for visual separation) and preserves the spacing conventions from HEAD. The function and constant imports below are common to both sides and should be retained. Here's the resolved snippet:

```php
use DateTimeImmutable;
use DateTimeInterface;
use InvalidArgumentException;
use Stringable;
use Throwable;

use function filter_var;

use const FILTER_VALIDATE_INT;

/**
