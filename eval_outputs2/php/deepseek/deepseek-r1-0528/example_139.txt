The merge conflict arises from two different formatting styles for the same assertion logic. Both versions aim to achieve identical functionality - checking for unexpected validation errors and providing a detailed error message. The key differences are:

1. Multi-line vs single-line formatting
2. `(new Collection(...))` vs `collect(...)` syntax for Laravel collections

The resolution combines the best aspects of both:
- Retains the multi-line formatting for better readability (from HEAD)
- Uses the more concise `collect()` helper (from the other branch)
- Preserves identical functionality and error message content

Here's the resolved code:

```php
            ->map(fn ($value, $key) => is_int($key) ? $value : $key)
            ->all();

        $unexpectedErrorKeys = Arr::except($jsonErrors, $expectedErrorKeys);

        PHPUnit::withResponse($this)->assertTrue(
            count($unexpectedErrorKeys) === 0,
            'Response has unexpected validation errors: '.collect($unexpectedErrorKeys)->keys()->map(fn ($key) => "'{$key}'")->join(', ')
        );

        return $this;
    }
