namespace FOS\OAuthServerBundle\Security\EntryPoint;

use OAuth2\OAuth2;
use OAuth2\OAuth2AuthenticateException;

use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AuthenticationException;
use Symfony\Component\Security\Http\EntryPoint\AuthenticationEntryPointInterface;

```

Explanation:
1. The conflict was resolved by merging explicit imports from both sides while removing duplicates
2. Added missing classes:
   - `Response` from the incoming branch
   - `OAuth2` from local HEAD branch
3. Kept logical grouping:
   - First OAuth2 classes
   - Then Symfony HttpFoundation
   - Finally Symfony Security components
4. Preserved alphabetical ordering within groups:
   - `Request` comes before `Response`
5. Maintained important dependencies:
   - `AuthenticationEntryPointInterface` is preserved as it's the interface being implemented
   - All exception classes needed for authentication flow are included

The resolution satisfies both branches' requirements by:
- Incorporating HEAD's `OAuth2\OAuth2` import needed for OAuth functionality
- Incorporating incoming branch's `Response` import required for HTTP responses
- Maintaining all other shared dependencies
- Eliminating duplicate imports
- Keeping related classes grouped together
