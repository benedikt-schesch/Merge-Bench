The conflict arises from two different approaches to defining a data provider in PHPUnit. The HEAD branch uses a docblock annotation with a return type hint, while the other branch uses a PHP 8 attribute without a return type. Both serve the same purpose of specifying a data provider. 

The resolution adopts the modern attribute syntax from the branch while preserving the return type hint from HEAD. This approach:
1. Uses PHP 8 attributes for better forward compatibility
2. Maintains type safety with the `void` return type
3. Avoids redundant declarations by removing the docblock

Here's the resolved code:

```php
    }

    #[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider('typeReturnMap')]
    public function testSimpleReturn($method, $expectedValue): void
    {
        $context = new \PhakeTest_ScalarTypes();
        $cb = $this->answer->getAnswerCallback($context, $method);

        $this->assertSame($expectedValue, $cb());
```
