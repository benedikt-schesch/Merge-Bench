The merge conflict involves differing expected exceptions for the same test method. Since the conflict markers indicate changes from different files (`tests/JAXLXmlTest.php` vs `tests/test_jaxl_xml.php`) and the intent behind choosing a `Warning` vs `Notice` exception is ambiguous without additional context, the conflict cannot be automatically resolved. Both changes appear semantically valid but target different error conditions, making manual resolution necessary.

Here's the unchanged snippet with the conflict preserved:

```php

    public static $NS = 'SOME_NAMESPACE';
    public static $attrs = array('attr1' => 'value1');

    /**
<<<<<<< HEAD:tests/JAXLXmlTest.php
     * @expectedException PHPUnit_Framework_Error_Warning
=======
     * @expectedException PHPUnit_Framework_Error_Notice
>>>>>>> 6c8615c992fb6938640ddfca299de55dc1012ed2:tests/test_jaxl_xml.php
     */
    public function testJAXLXml_0()
    {
        $xml = new JAXLXml();
        $this->assertEquals('<></>', $xml->to_string());

```
