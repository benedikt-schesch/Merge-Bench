**Resolution Explanation:**  
I resolved the conflict by:
1. Keeping the `@subpackage` from HEAD (`media.libs.media.adapter`) to match the current location of the file (`vendors/media/adapter/css_tidy.php`)
2. Using the `@copyright` line from the branch being merged (`2007-2010`) since this is an updated date that includes HEAD's coverage
3. Preserving all other context exactly as provided
4. Maintaining the semantic intent of both branches by combining valid improvements while maintaining path accuracy
