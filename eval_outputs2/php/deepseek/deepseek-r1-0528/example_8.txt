Based on the provided context and analyzing the semantic intent, I've resolved the conflict by removing the unnecessary blank line while preserving the functionality. Both branches are functionally identical - the only difference is whitespace formatting. The HEAD version (without the extra blank line) is cleaner and avoids potential whitespace issues in output.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```php
	 * @since 1.5.0
	 *
	 * @param string $tab Current tab being displayed.
	 */
	do_action( 'cptui_tools_sections', $tab );

	echo '</div><!-- End .wrap -->';
}
