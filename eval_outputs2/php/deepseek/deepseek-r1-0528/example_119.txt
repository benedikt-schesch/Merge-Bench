Based on the provided merge conflict, I'll resolve it by preserving both sets of imports while maintaining their original order. The conflict occurs between two sets of import statements that don't overlap semantically and appear to be independent additions.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```php

use Illuminate\Contracts\Container\Container;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Validation\Factory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Kris\LaravelFormBuilder\Filters\FilterResolver;
use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcher;
use Kris\LaravelFormBuilder\Form;
use Kris\LaravelFormBuilder\FormBuilder;
use Kris\LaravelFormBuilder\FormHelper;
use Orchestra\Testbench\TestCase;
use PHPUnit\Framework\Constraint\IsIdentical;

class TestModel extends Model {
    protected $fillable = ['m', 'f'];

    public function getAccessorAttribute($value)

```

Resolution approach:
1. Both branches added new imports after `FilterResolver`
2. The `EventDispatcher` import (from the other branch) is placed first as it appears earlier in the original conflict structure
3. The HEAD imports (`Form`, `FormBuilder`, etc.) follow in their original order
4. All spacing and context is preserved exactly as provided
5. No semantic conflicts exist since both sets of imports appear to be independent additions

The resolution maintains all functionality from both branches while preserving the original context exactly as requested.
