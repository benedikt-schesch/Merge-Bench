Resolving this merge conflict requires combining the intents from both branches.
*   The `HEAD` branch's intent is to add a `void` return type hint to the function signature, which is a code quality improvement for modern PHP.
*   The other branch's intent is to modernize the code by using a native PHP 8 `#[Depends]` attribute instead of the older `PHPDoc` annotation for PHPUnit.

The correct semantic resolution is to apply both of these modernizations. We will add the PHP attribute and the `void` return type to the function signature.

```php
    }

    /**
     * @depends testInitialize
     */
    #[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Depends('testInitialize')]
    public function testNamespaceAliasOnVar(): void
    {
        $this->initializer->initialize($this);

        $this->assertInstanceOf(\Phake\IMock::class, $this->shortNameMock1);
    }

```
