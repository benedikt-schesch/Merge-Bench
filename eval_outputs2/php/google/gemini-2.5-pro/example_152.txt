Resolving this conflict requires understanding the intended format of the API response. The surrounding code provides clues for error conditions:

*   `echo '{"cenError":"write access not granted."}';`
*   `echo '{"cenError":"user does not exist."}';`

Both of these return a JSON object with a key (`cenError`) and a descriptive string value.

Now let's look at the conflicting lines for the success case:

*   **HEAD:** `echo '{"cenInfo":"set"}'`
    This provides a JSON object with a key (`cenInfo`) and a simple status value. This is structurally consistent with the error responses.

*   **Branch `932ed...`:** `echo json_encode("saved to user " . $otherUser . " in group " . $groupName);`
    This provides a single JSON string (e.g., `"saved to user john in group admins"`), not a JSON object. This is structurally inconsistent with the error responses.

The most logical resolution is to maintain a consistent response format. The `HEAD` version aligns with the established pattern of returning a JSON object. Therefore, we will adopt the change from `HEAD`.

```php
						$userFoundInP = true;
					}
				}
				if ($userFoundInP === true || $openedWrite === "allowAll") {
					saveFile("$directory/$groupName/$otherUser/data.txt", $clientData);
					echo '{"cenInfo":"set"}';
				} else {
					echo '{"cenError":"write access not granted."}';
				}
			} else {
				echo '{"cenError":"user does not exist."}';

```
