An analysis of the merge conflict suggests that both sides are attempting to provide the correct Tamil translation for time differences, specifically for "in X minutes". The library's internationalization (i18n) framework likely constructs these phrases by combining a base time unit (e.g., "minute") with a suffix for "ago" or "from now".

*   **The `HEAD` version** (`'1 நிமிடம் இல்'`, `'5 நிமிடங்கள் இல்'`) uses the base nominative forms for "minute" (`நிமிடம்`) and "minutes" (`நிமிடங்கள்`) and assumes the framework will append the suffix ` இல்` (which means "in" or "at", used for future events). This is a standard and clean implementation pattern for such libraries.

*   **The `c5bda64d5e8e...` version** (`'1 நிமிடத்தில் இல்'`, `'5 நிமிடங்களில் இல்'`) uses the locative case forms for "minute" (`நிமிடத்தில்`) and "minutes" (`நிமிடங்களில்`). While `நிமிடத்தில்` correctly means "in a minute", the framework still appends the ` இல்` suffix, resulting in a grammatically redundant phrase that essentially means "in a minute in".

The intent of the `c5bda64d5e8e...` change was likely to make the time unit more grammatically correct in isolation, but it conflicts with how the full phrase is constructed, leading to an error.

Therefore, the `HEAD` version represents the correct approach for this framework's i18n design. It correctly separates the base noun from the grammatical suffix.

```php
        ///

        $oneAgo = Date::parse('1 minute');
        $fiveAgo = Date::parse('5 minutes');

        $this->assertEquals('1 நிமிடம் இல்', $oneAgo->ago());
        $this->assertEquals('5 நிமிடங்கள் இல்', $fiveAgo->ago());

        ///

        $oneAgo = Date::parse('1 hour');
        $fiveAgo = Date::parse('5 hours');

```
