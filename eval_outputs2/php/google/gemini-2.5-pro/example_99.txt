The `HEAD` branch uses the base words for "month" (`மாதம்`) and "months" (`மாதங்கள்`). The `c5bda64d...` branch uses the inflected, locative case for "month" (`மாதத்தில்` - "in the month") and "months" (`மாதங்களில்` - "in the months").

Looking at the commit message for the `c5bda64d...` hash, it explicitly mentions fixing Tamil translations. This indicates a deliberate grammatical correction. Using the inflected form is more grammatically correct in Tamil for this context, even if the suffixing framework might make it seem slightly redundant. Therefore, the changes from the `c5bda64d...` branch should be accepted as the intended correction.

```php
        ///

        $oneAgo = Date::parse('1 month');
        $fiveAgo = Date::parse('3 months');

        $this->assertEquals('1 மாதத்தில் இல்', $oneAgo->ago());
        $this->assertEquals('3 மாதங்களில் இல்', $fiveAgo->ago());

        ///

        $oneAgo = Date::parse('1 year');
        $fiveAgo = Date::parse('3 years');

```
