This is a conflict in an auto-generated asset manifest file, likely from a WordPress build process. The `version` key contains a content hash of a corresponding JavaScript or CSS file, used for cache-busting.

The conflict arises because both branches have rebuilt the assets, resulting in different hashes. The dependencies (`wp-element`, `wp-polyfill`) are identical. To resolve this, we should consider that after merging the source files, a new build will be required anyway, which will generate a new, correct hash.

However, to resolve the immediate conflict, the most sensible approach is to accept the version from the incoming branch (`0b9cd0d...`), as it represents the changes being merged. The final correct hash will be generated upon the next build after the merge is complete.

```php
<?php return array('dependencies' => array('wp-element', 'wp-polyfill'), 'version' => '576df7555644343f1d4ec8564e2b2d5f');

```
