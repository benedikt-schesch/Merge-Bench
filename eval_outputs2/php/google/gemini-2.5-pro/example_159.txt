An analysis of the conflict reveals two different approaches to storing namespace prefixes.

*   The `HEAD` branch uses a simple associative array, `$this->prefixes`, where the key is the full namespace prefix.
*   The `af25d22af4fc32920cf7d332f16e832e79ac6915` branch introduces `$this->prefixesPsr0` and a more optimized, two-level lookup structure. It first keys the array by the first character of the prefix and then by the full prefix.

The intent of the `af25d22af4fc32920cf7d332f16e832e79ac6915` branch is to refactor and optimize the prefix lookup, a common and beneficial pattern in class loaders. This is a more significant and intentional change than the simpler implementation in `HEAD`. Therefore, the resolution should adopt this optimization.

The dangling `<<<<<<< HEAD` marker at the end appears to be a copy-paste artifact from a larger conflict and has been removed to create valid code.

```php
                );
            }

            return;
        }

        $first = $prefix[0];
        if (!isset($this->prefixesPsr0[$first][$prefix])) {
            $this->prefixesPsr0[$first][$prefix] = (array) $paths;

            return;
        }
        if ($prepend) {
