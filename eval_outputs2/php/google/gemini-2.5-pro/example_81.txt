An expert analysis of this merge conflict indicates that the two branches are not in direct opposition but rather that `git` has failed to correctly identify the bounds of the changes, leading to a confusing conflict block.

*   **HEAD's Intent:** The `HEAD` branch contains the line `return $this->serveDevelopmentCollection(...)`. This is the standard procedure for serving assets in a development environment where assets are compiled on the fly. It seems this branch may have removed the production logic, forcing the development path.
*   **Remote's Intent (9b5f2feb...):** The `REMOTE` branch is refactoring the production asset serving logic. The commit hash and code snippet clearly indicate a move towards using a manifest file to find pre-compiled assets, which is a common practice for production environments. If an asset is not found in the manifest, it returns an HTML comment indicating the failure.

**Semantic Resolution:**

The correct resolution is to combine the intents of both branches. The application needs to be able to serve assets in both production and development environments. The `REMOTE` branch provides the improved production logic, and the `HEAD` branch provides the necessary development logic.

The `REMOTE` logic should be executed when the application is in production. The `HEAD` logic should be the fallback for when the application is not in production. The conflict appears to have arisen from a "delete/modify" conflict where `HEAD` deleted the production `if` block while `REMOTE` modified its contents.

The resolution below restores the intended structure:

1.  An `if` block checks if the application is in production.
2.  Inside this block, the new manifest-based logic from the `REMOTE` branch is used.
3.  After the `if` block, the development server logic from the `HEAD` branch is used as the fallback.

```php
            {
                // This block is replaced by the new production logic.
                if ($response = $this->app['basset.manifest']->get($collection->getIdentifier()))
                {
                    return array_to_newlines($response);
                }
                else
                {
                    return '<!-- Basset could not find manifest entry for collection: '.$collection->getIdentifier().' -->';
                }
            }
        }

        // Fallback to development serving if not in production.
        return $this->serveDevelopmentCollection($collection, $group, $format);
    }

    /**
     * Serve a production collection.
     *
