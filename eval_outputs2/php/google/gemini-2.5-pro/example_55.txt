An analysis of the conflict shows two distinct changes in the incoming branch (`1922e06...`):
1.  The copyright year was updated from `2009` to `2010`. This is a routine and desirable update.
2.  The `@subpackage` was changed from `...media.adapter` to `...medium.adapter`. This corresponds with a file path change indicated in the conflict marker (`.../media/...` to `.../medium/...`), suggesting a directory was renamed as part of a refactoring effort.

The most semantic resolution is to accept both of these changes. The copyright update is current, and the `@subpackage` change correctly reflects the refactored directory structure, even if other parts of the code base have not yet been updated.
