Resolving the merge conflict requires understanding the semantic difference between the two sides.

*   **HEAD's intent (`$loop->defer(...)`)**: This schedules the callback to be executed on the *next tick* of the event loop. The intent is to enable the signal handler (`$loop->enable($sig2)`) and then, as soon as the current operation is finished and the event loop proceeds, send the signal. This is a common pattern for ensuring that one event-driven action happens immediately after another in a deterministic, logical sequence without relying on wall-clock time.

*   **eb2f325586... intent (`$loop->delay(1, ...)`):** This schedules the callback to be executed after a 1-unit (likely millisecond) delay. The intent is to enable the signal handler and then wait for a very short period of real time before sending the signal. This might be intended to avoid a race condition or more closely simulate a signal arriving from an external source sometime after the handler is enabled.

**Resolution:**

For testing and ensuring a deterministic sequence of events within an event loop, using `defer` is generally more robust and less prone to flakiness than using a small `delay`. A `delay` introduces a dependency on the system's timer precision and can be affected by system load, whereas `defer` operates purely on the logical ticks of the event loop.

The `defer` approach better expresses the intent of "once `sig2` is enabled, immediately test it by sending a signal." Therefore, the version from `HEAD` is chosen as the most semantically sound and robust resolution.

```php
            $loop->enable($sig1);
            $loop->cancel($sig3);
            $loop->onSignal(SIGUSR1, $f(2));
            $loop->defer(function () use ($loop, $sig2): void {
                $loop->enable($sig2);
                $loop->defer(function () use ($loop): void {
                    \posix_kill(\getmypid(), \SIGUSR1);
                    $loop->delay($msDelay = 10, function () use ($loop): void {
                        $loop->stop();
                    });
                });

```
