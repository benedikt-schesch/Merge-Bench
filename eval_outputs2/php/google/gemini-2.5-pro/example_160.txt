This merge conflict arises in a method for adding a PSR-4 autoloading prefix, likely `addPsr4`.

*   **The `HEAD` branch** adds the line `$this->prefixes[$prefix] = (array) $paths;`. This registers the PSR-4 prefix and its paths into a general `$this->prefixes` property, in addition to the PSR-4 specific properties (`$prefixLengthsPsr4` and `$prefixDirsPsr4`).
*   **The other branch (`af25...`)** removes this line, suggesting that PSR-4 prefixes should be handled exclusively by the PSR-4 specific logic and properties.

**Semantic Intent Analysis:**

Autoloaders often handle different standards (like PSR-0 and PSR-4) with separate logic because their path resolution rules differ. The `HEAD` change mixes the PSR-4 registration with what is likely a more generic or PSR-0 related prefix list (`$this->prefixes`). This could lead to incorrect class lookups if the code attempts to resolve a PSR-4 path using PSR-0 rules.

The intent of the other branch is cleaner and safer: it maintains a clear separation of concerns. PSR-4 prefixes are stored only in PSR-4 specific properties, preventing them from being processed by other, potentially incompatible, autoloading logic. This is the standard practice in autoloaders like Composer's.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the changes from the `af25d22af4fc32920cf7d332f16e832e79ac6915` branch, which is to not add the prefix to the generic `$this->prefixes` array.

```php
                throw new \InvalidArgumentException("A non-empty PSR-4 prefix must end with a namespace separator.");
            }
            $this->prefixLengthsPsr4[$prefix[0]][$prefix] = $length;
            $this->prefixDirsPsr4[$prefix] = (array) $paths;
        }
    }
