The merge conflict arises from two independent changes: a refactoring that renames a directory from `media` to `medium` and an update to the copyright year.

*   **HEAD** references the subpackage as `media.tests.cases.libs.media.adapter` and has a copyright year up to `2009`.
*   The **incoming change** references the subpackage as `media.tests.cases.libs.medium.adapter` (reflecting the directory rename from `media` to `medium` as shown in the filename `.../vendors/medium/...`) and updates the copyright year to `2010`.

The semantic resolution is to combine both intents:
1.  Accept the subpackage rename to `medium`, as this is a significant refactoring and the docblock should correctly reflect the file's location.
2.  Accept the updated copyright year, as it is a routine and correct chronological update.

Both desired changes are present in the incoming branch. Therefore, the resolution is to accept the incoming block in its entirety.
