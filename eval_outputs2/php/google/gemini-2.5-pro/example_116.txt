Resolving this conflict requires understanding the difference between `!empty()` and `isset()`.

*   **`HEAD` (`!empty($checkFields[0])`)**: This version checks if `$checkFields[0]` exists and is not a "falsy" value (e.g., `null`, `false`, `0`, `""`). For a database column name, this is a robust check, as an empty string or zero would likely be an invalid column.
*   **`7f537526...` (`isset($checkFields[0])`)**: This version only checks if `$checkFields[0]` is set and not `null`. It would allow an empty string (`""`) or `0` to pass as a valid column name, which could lead to errors.

**Resolution:**

The intent is to add a valid `WHERE` clause to a query. An empty column name is invalid. Therefore, the `!empty()` check is semantically more correct and safer. It ensures the column name is not just present but has a meaningful value.

```php
                $whereKey[] = $checkFields[0];
                $whereValue[] = \array_slice((array) $checkFields, 2);
                $combiner[] = \_AND;
                $extra[] = null;
            } else {
                if (!empty($checkFields[0])) {
                    $whereKey[] = $checkFields[0];
                    $whereValue[] = (isset($checkFields[2])) ? $checkFields[2] : '';
                    $combiner[] = (isset($checkFields[3])) ? $checkFields[3] : \_AND;
                    $extra[] = (isset($checkFields[4])) ? $checkFields[4] : null;
                }
