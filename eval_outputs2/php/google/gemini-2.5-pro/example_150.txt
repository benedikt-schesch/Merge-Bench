An expert in semantic merge conflict resolution would recognize that both branches are attempting to solve the same problem: ensuring that `$permissionProperties` contains a valid, iterable set of permissions before the `foreach` loop is executed.

*   **The `HEAD` branch (`if ($permissionProperties !== "")`)**: This is a weak and likely incorrect check. `json_decode` returns `null` for an empty or invalid JSON string, and an object or array for valid JSON. Comparing its result to an empty string `""` does not robustly check if there are permissions to process.
*   **The `932edc45...` branch (`if (is_assoc($permissionProperties) === true)`)**: This check is more semantically correct. Although `is_assoc` is not a standard PHP function, its name implies it checks for an associative array (or, in this context, an object that can be treated as one). This aligns perfectly with the intent to iterate over key-value pairs (`$propertyName => $propertyValue`) in the following `foreach` loop. This check correctly verifies the *structure* of the data, which is what matters here.

The most logical resolution is to adopt the `is_assoc` check as it more accurately and safely expresses the developer's intent.

```php
					//actual data
					$openedData = json_decode($openedData);
					$permissionProperties = json_decode($openedPropertyPerm);

					$isThere = false;
					if (is_assoc($permissionProperties) === true) {//make sure permissions are set

						$outputObj = array();
						//create obj for properties user is given access to.

						foreach ($permissionProperties as $propertyName => $propertyValue) {

```
