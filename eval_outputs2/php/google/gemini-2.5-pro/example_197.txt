This merge conflict arises from two separate, non-conflicting changes being applied to the same line:

1.  **HEAD:** A `: void` return type was added to the method signature for stricter typing, a common practice for modern PHP test suites.
2.  **Branch `78e410ae3ae8d3249e757e46cbab122d33af879e`:** The test was updated to use the modern PHP 8 attribute syntax (`#[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider(...)]`) instead of the older PHPDoc annotation (`@dataProvider`).

The correct semantic resolution is to combine both intents: use the modern attribute syntax and include the `void` return type. The PHPDoc annotation `@dataProvider` becomes redundant with the new attribute and should be removed for a clean, modern implementation.

```php


    #[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\DataProvider('magicGetInvalidData')]
    public function testMagicGetWithInvalidData($invalidData, $exceptionContains): void
    {
        $this->expectException(\InvalidArgumentException::class);
        $this->proxy->__get($invalidData);
    }


```
