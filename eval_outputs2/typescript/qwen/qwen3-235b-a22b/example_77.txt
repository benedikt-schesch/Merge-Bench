Here is the resolved snippet, maintaining the context exactly as provided and resolving the conflict by retaining the **type assertion** (`as LogLineEval`) from the other side and selecting a clean console.error logging format. This choice ensures:

- **Type correctness** for the function's return value (`LogLineEval`) in case of error.
- **Consistent and concise error logging**, avoiding redundant output.

```typescript
              entry.type === "object" ? JSON.parse(entry.value) : entry.value,
            ]),
          )
        : undefined,
    } as LogLineEval;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error parsing log line:`, logLine);
    return logLine as LogLineEval;
  }
}

export class EvalLogger {
  logs: LogLineEval[] = [];
```
