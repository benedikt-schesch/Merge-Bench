The provided merge conflict involves two divergent implementations of a `signout` method whose intent is to retrieve a client from a `Map` and then call `signout()` on it. Both sides of the merge differ in the first parameter passed to the method:

```typescript
<<<<<<< HEAD
  async signout (personId: PersonId, byError: boolean = false): Promise<number> {
    let client = this.clients.get(personId)
=======
  async signout (value: string, byError: boolean = false): Promise<number> {
    let client = this.clients.get(value)
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
```

### Semantics and Intent

The essential intent of both implementations is **to retrieve a client by a given identifier and perform a sign-out operation**. Both methods then retrieve the client from `this.clients`, await and sign it out — the post-conflict code is identical. However, the **disagreement lies in the type and naming of the identifier**.

- The `HEAD` version uses a `PersonId` type, suggesting a domain-specific type for person identifiers, potentially an opaque or branded type (e.g., `type PersonId = string & { __brand: 'personId' };`), ensuring well-typed usage.
- The other version (`e0ec8d4…`) uses a plain `string` type, which is less descriptive but potentially broader in scope or relying on an untyped domain model.

Because both function similarly in implementation and only differ in **parameter typing and naming**, the key distinction centers around whether a **typed identifier (`PersonId`) vs. a raw string** is appropriate for this use case.

### Resolution Decision

While there is a strong case for typedef typing (e.g., `PersonId`) as it increases type safety and communicates intent, the ambiguity lies in the definition and consistency of `this.clients`. If `this.clients` expects a `string` as a key and `PersonId` is merely a branded string, using `PersonId` directly could result in a runtime issue (e.g., Map miss), especially if the branding is nominal.

Since the resolution requires insight into the broader codebase (specifically: the type of key expected by `this.clients`) and assumptions could introduce bugs or obscure domain intentions, the conflict remains ambiguous and **cannot be confidently resolved without additional context**.

Thus, per the instructions: **when intent is ambiguous**, we **return the snippet including the conflict markers.**

### Final Output

```typescript
    }

    return personId
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  async signout (personId: PersonId, byError: boolean = false): Promise<number> {
    let client = this.clients.get(personId)
=======
  async signout (value: string, byError: boolean = false): Promise<number> {
    let client = this.clients.get(value)
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
    if (client !== undefined) {
      if (client instanceof Promise) {
        client = await client
      }
      await client.signout()
```
