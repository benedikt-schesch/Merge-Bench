The intent of both sides is to destructure certain Electron-related APIs from the `useElectron` hook. One side focuses on acquiring a page title (`getPageTitle`), while the other side adds IPC communication functionality (`addIpcListener`, `removeIpcListener`). Both capabilities can coexist meaningfully in a typical Electron app, especially if the component both interacts with the Electron process and needs to respond to or update the window title.

The appropriate resolution is to include **all three functions** from both sides of the conflict to retain the full functionality intended by both branches.

Here is the **resolved code snippet** with the conflict markers removed and the corrected function list, returning the entire snippet as requested:

```typescript
    addDownloadItem,
    addDownloadItems,
    downloadItemsNow,
    downloadNow,
    getLocalIP,
    getPageTitle,
    addIpcListener,
    removeIpcListener,
  } = useElectron();
  const appStore = useAppStore(useShallow(appStoreSelector));
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  const [localIP, setLocalIP] = useState<string>("");
  const newFormRef = useRef<DownloadFormRef>(null);
```
