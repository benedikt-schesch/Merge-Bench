The merge conflict involves the `externalUser` field, which is set to either `email` or `me`. Without explicit context defining what `email` and `me` refer to (e.g., variable definitions) or the intended semantics of `externalUser` (e.g., user identifier in external system vs. internal user reference), the resolution is ambiguous. Both values could be semantically valid depending on the system's design. Since intent cannot be definitively determined from the provided snippet, the conflict is preserved as is.

```typescript
        const data: Data<ExternalCalendar> = {
          name: val.summary ?? '',
          visibility: 'freeBusy',
          hidden: false,
          externalId: val.id,
<<<<<<< HEAD
          externalUser: email,

          default: false
        }
        if (val.primary === true) {
          const primaryExists = await this.client.findOne(
            calendar.class.ExternalCalendar,
