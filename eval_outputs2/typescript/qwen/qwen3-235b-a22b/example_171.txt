The merge conflict reflects a critical semantic choice between two distinct identifiers for the system account—UUID (`systemAccountUuid`) and email (`systemAccountEmail`). Both sides of the merge appear to follow the same high-level intent: skip the system account during a check over connected sessions.

However, without additional context about whether `val.session.getUser()` returns a UUID or an email, or any broader architectural change that might have motivated the use of one identifier over the other, it is not possible to conclusively resolve this conflict safely.

Therefore, following guidance for cases where intent is ambiguous, we preserve the conflict markers to indicate the unresolved choice.

```typescript
      if (this.ticks % (60 * ticksPerSecond) === workspace.tickHash) {
        try {
          // update account lastVisit every minute per every workspace.∏
          let connected: boolean = false
          for (const val of workspace.sessions.values()) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            if (val.session.getUser() !== systemAccountUuid) {
=======
            if (val.session.getUser() !== systemAccountEmail) {
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
              connected = true
              break
            }
          }
<<<<<<< HEAD
