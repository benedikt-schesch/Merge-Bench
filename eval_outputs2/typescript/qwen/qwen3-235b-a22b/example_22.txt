The merge conflict involves two distinct implementations affecting both the function signature and object property merging approach. Both aim to achieve similar semantic goals:

1. **Function parameter type**
   - One uses `Options`
   - The other uses `RegisterOptions`

   These may represent distinct type definitions or simply be renamed variants. Without clarity on which type is correct or whether they're interchangeable, resolution is speculative.

2. **Object merging strategy**
   - One uses the modern ES6 `...` spread syntax
   - The other uses `Object.assign`

   These are functionally equivalent in this case, so this is more of a stylistic or versioning concern.

### Semantic Consideration

Since both approaches achieve the function's goal — merging `DEFAULTS` and `opts` into a fresh `options` object — and since the type (`Options` vs `RegisterOptions`) cannot be definitively resolved without more context, the **intent behind this conflict remains ambiguous**.

Therefore, and in accordance with the instruction guidelines, the appropriate action is to **leave the conflict markers in place** rather than impose assumptions about intent or implementation preferences.

Here is the full snippet, preserving context and spacing:

```typescript
}

/**
 * Register TypeScript compiler instance onto node.js
 */
<<<<<<< HEAD
export function register (opts: Options = {}): Register {
  const options = { ...DEFAULTS, ...opts }
=======
export function register (opts: RegisterOptions = {}): Register {
  const options = Object.assign({}, DEFAULTS, opts)

  const originalJsHandler = require.extensions['.js'] // tslint:disable-line
  const service = create(options)
  const extensions = ['.ts']

  // Enable additional extensions when JSX or `allowJs` is enabled.
