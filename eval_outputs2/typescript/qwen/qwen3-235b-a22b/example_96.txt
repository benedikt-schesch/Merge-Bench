Here is the resolved code snippet considering the intent and semantics of both merge contributors:

```typescript
        return this;
    }

    public async unsubscribe(topic: string, callback?: Callback) {
        if (callback) {
          this.channels.removeListener(topic, callback);
        } else {
          this.channels.removeAllListeners(topic);
        }
```

Resolution rationale:
1. The HEAD version uses `this.channels.removeListener(topic, callback)` - a standard pattern for EventEmitter implementations which directly matches the semantic intent of removing a specific listener callback.
2. The conflicted branch attempts to modify a `topicCallbacks` array that:
   - Is not defined in the provided context
   - Introduces state management not present elsewhere in the snippet
   - Breaks the direct EventEmitter pattern used in the non-conflicted code
3. Maintaining the EventEmitter pattern provides better consistency with the `removeAllListeners` fallback case and requires fewer implementation assumptions.

The resolution preserves the working functionality while maintaining a consistent pattern with the surrounding code's architecture intent.
