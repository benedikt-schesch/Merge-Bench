The two commits introduce differing lists of named imports from `'@angular/cdk/testing'`. While both aim to import certain named exports like `FEB`, `JAN`, `NOV`, `JUL`, one adds `MockNgZone` and `NOV`, while the other adds `DEC`, `FEB`, `JAN`, `NOV`, and `JUL`.

### Semantic Conflict Analysis

Both branches retain the core month abbreviations (FEB, JAN, JUL, NOV), but differ in:

1. **Presence of `MockNgZone`**: Present in HEAD, absent in the other branch.
2. **Addition of `DEC`**: Only in the other branch.
3. **Ordering of elements**: There's a different arrangement in the list.

The intent is unclear on what ordering should prevail or whether `MockNgZone` should be kept. The order may indicate a chronological sequence of months (`JAN` - `DEC`), an alphabetical arrangement, or a functional grouping â€” none of which can be confirmed without more context.

---

### Resolution Decision

Because the order and presence of symbols are both in conflict, and the **intent behind the imports is ambiguous**, the **best practice** is to **leave the merge conflict unresolved**, encouraging manual resolution by the developers familiar with the context.
