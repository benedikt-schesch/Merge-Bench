The provided code snippet contains a **merge conflict** in the `dummyWatch` method. Specifically, the line `const me = await this.googleClient.getMe()` was added in one branch (identified by commit hash `e0ec8d4`) but appears to have been removed or not included in the `HEAD` branch. Outside of the conflict, the shared logic involves starting a timeout to later invoke `this.sync(calendarId)`.

---

### Analysis

The conflict arises from a semantic divergence between two changes:

- `HEAD` removes or omits the `const me = await this.googleClient.getMe()` line.
- The incoming commit adds this line, likely intending to establish an identity context (possibly for downstream operations involving `me`).

However, **the rest of the code provided doesn't make use of `me`**, and it's unclear from the snippet whether that value is used elsewhere within the function or the larger codebase.

---

### Decision Criteria

Per your instructions:
- **Preserve the context exactly as is** (no formatting or structural modifications).
- **Only resolve the conflict** if the intent is semantically clear.
- If **uncertain**, return the conflict unchanged.

Given the lack of clarity about whether the `me` variable is necessary (and whether its omission or inclusion reflects the correct semantic intent), **the appropriate resolution is to return the code snippet as is**, including the unresolved merge conflict.

### Final Output

```typescript
      await this.dummyWatch(calendarId)
    }
  }

  private async dummyWatch (calendarId: string): Promise<void> {
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    const me = await this.googleClient.getMe()
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
    const timer = setTimeout(
      () => {
        void this.sync(calendarId)
      },
      6 * 60 * 60 * 1000
```
