The merge conflict arises from two different commands being executed in the same line inside the `before` hook:

- The `HEAD` change suggests initializing an empty npm project using `nodeInstaller` based on its configuration.
- The other branch (`84eb77568a8933099dafb531a9ed7e003870165`) suggests setting up the test environment by cloning the `electron-quick-start` repository into the test directory.

Both changes modify the same line in opposing ways: one replaces it with a local `init`, and the other replaces it with a `git clone` of an existing project. This creates a semantic divergence in how the test setup proceeds â€” one starts from an empty directory and initializes it, while the other starts from an existing template.

Given this ambiguity, it's unclear which approach should take precedence or whether both should be used in sequence to properly support the downstream test case `it('creates forge.config.js and is packageable')`. 

Since the intent behind the changes is not definitively clear and depends on the expected test behavior, we cannot resolve the merge conflict safely without additional context.

Here is the original code with the merge conflict preserved:

```typescript

    describe('import', () => {
      before(async () => {
        dir = await ensureTestDirIsNonexistent();
        await fs.mkdir(dir);
<<<<<<< HEAD
        execSync(nodeInstaller === 'pnpm' ? `${nodeInstaller} init` : `${nodeInstaller} init -y`, {
=======
        execSync(`git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start.git . --quiet`, {
>>>>>>> 84eb77568a8933099dafb531a9ed7e003870165
          cwd: dir,
        });
      });

      it('creates forge.config.js and is packageable', async () => {

```
