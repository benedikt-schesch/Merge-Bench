The merged TypeScript code snippet with resolved import conflicts is as follows:

```typescript
import { map } from 'nanostores'
import {
  createContext,
  createElement,
  Fragment,
  useContext,
  type Context,
  type ProviderProps,
  type ReactElement,
  type ReactNode
} from 'react'
import { debugEnabled } from '../../debug'
import { error } from '../../errors'
import type { AdapterInterface, UseAdapterHook } from './defs'

export type AdapterContext = {
```

**Explanation:**  
- Combined both sets of React imports into a single import statement to avoid duplication and include all necessary exports.
- Retained the `map` import from `nanostores` since it's introduced in the `HEAD` branch and not present in the other version.
- Maintained the exact naming/order for readability and merged TypeScript `type` imports where applicable (e.g., `type ReactNode`).
- Conflicting dynamically imported parts were resolved by merging all required symbols and removing overlapping/identical ones.
