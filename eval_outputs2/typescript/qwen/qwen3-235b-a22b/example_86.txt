The merge conflict marker in the provided code snippet represents an unresolved decision between two different semantic intentions regarding which version number (`'1.37.0'` from `HEAD` or `'1.35.5'` from a remote commit) should be retained in the final version of the file.

---

### Semantic Intent Analysis:
- **Version `'1.37.0'` from `HEAD`**: This likely represents a more recent local update to the project’s version, possibly as a result of prior merges or development work.
- **Version `'1.35.5'` from the other commit**: This version may represent a version that was deliberately set in a branch prior to merging, potentially for a hotfix, release staging, or as part of a different development lifecycle strategy.

Since the semantic version number typically represents the state of the code, and those numbers are usually managed deliberately based on development practices (e.g., SemVer, CI pipelines, or release scripts), **the correct version in this context depends on the project’s versioning philosophy** and the specific history being merged.

---

### Conclusion:
Given that there is **no additional context** to determine whether:
- The version number should be preserved from the branch being merged in,
- Or whether the `HEAD` branch’s version should dominate,
we **cannot definitively resolve** the merge conflict without introducing the risk of semantic misinterpretation.

Therefore, the safest and most semantically accurate action is to **retdefer resolution until the developer can assess the versioning context.**

### Output:
Here is the original snippet, preserved in full with spacing and conflict markers as instructed:
