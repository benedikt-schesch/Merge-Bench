The resolution hinges on reconciling the difference in the `sessionFactory` function signature based on the expected constructor parameters of `ClientSession`. Since we are operating within the bounds of a semantic merge, both the intent and signature need to align.

- On `HEAD` the `sessionFactory` signature is:
  ```ts
  (token, workspace, account) => new ClientSession(token, workspace, account, true)
  ```
- On the SHA (`e0ec8d42`) side the version is:
  ```ts
  (token, workspace) => new ClientSession(token, workspace, true)
  ```

There appears to be a mismatch in the number of parameters being passed to `ClientSession`. This suggests a possible refactor that wasnâ€™t fully propagated or conflicting logic between branches about session authentication or user context.

### Semantic Merge Considerations
The function signature difference implies a divergence in how session creation is managed:
- One branch maintains an explicit reference to `account` being used to instantiate a `ClientSession`.
- The other version implies the `account` is either omitted, optional, or absorbed into a different workflow.

This could mean:
- The ClientSession constructor has evolved in one branch.
- Some logic involving session creation has been refactored, possibly moving away from the `account` parameter or treating it differently.

Since we're instructed to preserve and only resolve when intent is unambiguous, and no further information is given to resolve whether `account` is now obsolete or required, the conflict should remain unresolved.

### Final Snippet (Conflict Preserved)
```typescript
          return { docs: [] }
        },
        loadModel: async (ctx, lastModelTx, hash) => []
      }
    },
