The resolution merges all necessary imports from both sides. The imports from `keysOf` and `breakpoints` are retained from `HEAD` to preserve the Jest test mock logic which likely depends on the `breakpoints` variable. The `getBreakpoint` import from the other side is also included, assuming it is used elsewhere in the component logic that depends on runtime-determined breakpoints. No functional conflict arises since the imported identifiers are distinct.

import { useContext } from 'react';
import { keysOf } from '../../components/common';
import { breakpoint as breakpoints } from '../../themes/amsterdam/global_styling/variables/_breakpoint';
import { getBreakpoint } from './breakpoint';
import { CurrentEuiBreakpointContext } from './current_breakpoint';

/**
 * Jest tests *likely* will not have a wrapping EuiProvider. If they don't,
 * this test mock mimics CurrentEuiBreakpoint logic (w/o resize observers).
