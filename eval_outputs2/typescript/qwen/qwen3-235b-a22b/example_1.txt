The code snippet with the **unresolved semantic merge conflict** is preserved below. The ambiguity lies in the use of `map<AdapterContext>({...})` (custom or library-specific) versus `createContext<AdapterContext>({...})` (standard React API). The two functions may have different internal behaviors, and changing one for the other could break intended functionality without more context on `map`.

```typescript

export type AdapterContext = {
  useAdapter: UseAdapterHook
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
export const context = map<AdapterContext>({
=======
export const context: Context<AdapterContext> = createContext<AdapterContext>({
>>>>>>> 8458d55f197c8a6f60d2c01c2182c473c2a45c3c
  useAdapter() {
    throw new Error(error(404))
  }
})

```
