The merge conflict is located in a situation where one branch added a `console.warn` to signal the absence of a calendar, and the other removed it without clear context or additional logic (e.g., turning it into debug logging or replacing it with a tracing mechanism). The `create` parameter is unused, so it doesn't help us understand intent or indicate a variance in control flow. 

Given this ambiguity, resolving programmatically—such as choosing to keep or remove the `console.warn`—would be speculative, and the "intent" behind the conflicting changes is not sufficiently determinable. 

Thus, the best approach is to **preserve the merge conflict marker exactly as is**, per the instructions, so the developers can explicitly decide and resolve it in the broader context of their application logic.

```typescript

    const calendar = this.calendars.byId.get(id)
    if (calendar === undefined) {

      return

    const client = this.clients.get(calendar.externalUser)
    if (client instanceof Promise) {
      return await client
