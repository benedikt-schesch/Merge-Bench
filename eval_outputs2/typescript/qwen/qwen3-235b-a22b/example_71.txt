The semantic intent of both changes is unclear due to insufficient context. Both version numbers could represent valid intentions (patch vs major update) without additional information about release cycles or merge branch purposes. Since the conflict resolution must be based strictly on observable semantics and intent, and these version changes lack distinguishing context, the conflict cannot be resolved automatically.
