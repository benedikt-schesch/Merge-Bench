The merge conflict involves a single line: `USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS=true`. The left side (HEAD) includes this configuration value, and the right side (MERGE_HEAD) deletes it. To resolve this, we must evaluate the semantics of the flag and its implications.

---

### Intent Analysis

- The application is generating a configuration for Ollama, a local LLM-serving platform.
- The configuration includes:
  - The Ollama API endpoint (`http://localhost:11434`).
  - The main model (`gemma3`) and the embedding model (`nomic-embed-text`).
- These two models are both from the Ollama ecosystem and require the Ollama runtime to function.

The line `USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS=true` suggests a behavior toggle, possibly influencing whether the application attempts to use Ollama-based models at runtime. Omitting this line might default the flag to false in the environment configuration, which could disable the intended use of these Ollama-based models entirely.

Given that:
- The rest of the configuration is entirely around setting up Ollama models.
- There is an explicit guide in the comments for installing Ollama and pulling the models,
  
It's safe to assume the intention of this code is to rely on Ollama for text modeling. This supports keeping the flag enabled.

### Resolution

The line `USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS=true` should be preserved because it explicitly supports the intended usage of Ollama text models as per the rest of the configuration and comments.

Here is the resolved version of the file, with the conflict markers removed and the correct semantic line retained:

```typescript

          content += '\n# Local AI Configuration (using Ollama)\n';
          content += 'OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434\n';
          content += 'OLLAMA_MODEL=gemma3\n';
          content += 'OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text\n';
          content += 'USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS=true\n';
          content += '# Make sure Ollama is installed and running: https://ollama.ai/\n';
          content += '# Pull models with: ollama pull gemma3 && ollama pull nomic-embed-text\n';

          await fs.writeFile(envFilePath, content, 'utf8');
        } else {

```
