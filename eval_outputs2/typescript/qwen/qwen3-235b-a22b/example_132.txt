The merge conflict involves two distinct sets of properties being passed to `savePatchApplicationState`, each reflecting a potentially different intent for how the function should be used.

---

### Analysis of the Conflict

On **`HEAD`**, the following properties are passed:

```ts
patchFileContents: diffResult.stdout.toString(),
packageVersion,
patchPath
```

These indicate that the current branch’s logic assumes `savePatchApplicationState` requires or benefits from the raw string content of a generated patch file as well as metadata like version and path — likely for saving a single patch file on disk.

On the **other branch (`c7c63bf8...`)**, this set is passed:

```ts
patches: nextState,
isRebasing: didFailWhileFinishingRebase
```

This suggests a change in approach: `savePatchApplicationState` may now accept an array of patches (`nextState`) representing multiple patch steps or a rebase timeline, along with an updated `isRebasing` flag, possibly reflecting more nuanced state tracking (e.g., recovery from failed rebases).

---

### Semantics and Intent

There is a clear conceptual shift between the two branches:

- One treats patch application as a single patch file process.
- The other represents state as a collection of patches with an updated flag.

This is likely not just a code formatting conflict but a **semantic divergence**. While both branches aim to save patch application state in similar conditions (`isRebasing || numPatchesAfterCreate > 1`), they differ fundamentally in how that state is modeled and persisted.

Without knowledge of `savePatchApplicationState`'s actual interface or how its consumers expect data, **merging both change sets naively risks introducing incorrect or incoherent state handling**. For example, if the function now expects `patches` but still receives `patchFileContents`, the logic could be broken.

---

### Conclusion

Because this is **not just a conflict of code syntax, but of data representation and potentially of function contract**, and the correct resolution cannot be determined from context alone, **the appropriate response is to preserve the conflict markers** and leave final resolution to a human with deeper understanding of the system.

### Final Output
```typescript
    }

    if (isRebasing || numPatchesAfterCreate > 1) {
      savePatchApplicationState({
        packageDetails,
<<<<<<< HEAD
        patchFileContents: diffResult.stdout.toString(),
        packageVersion,
        patchPath,
=======
        patches: nextState,
        isRebasing: didFailWhileFinishingRebase,
>>>>>>> c7c63bf80b3c6b8640b933e20229121b4edfc100
      })
    } else {
      clearPatchApplicationState(packageDetails)
    }
```
