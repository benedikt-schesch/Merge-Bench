The conflict is between the type and name of the first parameter in the `signout` method.

-   **`HEAD`** uses `personId: PersonId`, which is specific and descriptive. It suggests that the key for the `this.clients` map is of a custom type `PersonId`.
-   The **other branch** uses `value: string`, which is more generic.

Given the surrounding context, where the preceding function returns a `personId`, using `personId: PersonId` is more consistent and semantically clearer. It explicitly states the kind of identifier the method expects, which improves type safety and readability. Therefore, the `HEAD` version is the better choice.

```typescript
    }

    return personId
  }

  async signout (personId: PersonId, byError: boolean = false): Promise<number> {
    let client = this.clients.get(personId)
    if (client !== undefined) {
      if (client instanceof Promise) {
        client = await client
      }
      await client.signout()

```
