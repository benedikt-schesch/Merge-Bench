This merge conflict is purely stylistic, occurring within a JSDoc comment block. Both sides of the merge convey the same semantic information:

1.  The method `getPopupConnectionElementRef` is deprecated.
2.  It will be removed or become a breaking change in version `7.0.0`.
3.  The replacement method is `getConnectedOverlayOrigin`.

The `HEAD` branch uses the `@deletion-target` tag, while the other branch uses `@breaking-change`. The `@breaking-change` tag is a common convention, especially in projects that follow standards like Conventional Commits for automated changelog generation. This suggests that the change to use `@breaking-change` is likely a project-wide standardization effort. Therefore, resolving in favor of the `@breaking-change` syntax aligns with this intent.

```typescript
      @Optional() @Inject(CDK_DATE_FORMATS) _cdkDateFormats?: CdkDateFormats) {
    super(_elementRef, _dateAdapter, _cdkDateFormats || _matDateFormats);
  }

  /**
   * @deprecated
   * @breaking-change 7.0.0 Use `getConnectedOverlayOrigin` instead
   */
  getPopupConnectionElementRef(): ElementRef {
    return this.getConnectedOverlayOrigin();
  }
