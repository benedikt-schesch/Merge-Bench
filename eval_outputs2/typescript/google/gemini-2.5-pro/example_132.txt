The intent of the `HEAD` branch is to save the state of a single patch file being created. The intent of the `c7c63bf80b3c6b8640b933e20229121b4edfc100` branch is to save the state of a more complex patch "rebase" operation, which can involve multiple patches.

Given the surrounding conditional `if (isRebasing || ...)` and the variable names `didFailWhileFinishingRebase` and `nextState`, the second branch's implementation is more aligned with the broader context of handling multiple patches and rebasing operations. It represents a more feature-complete state-saving mechanism for this complex workflow. Therefore, we should adopt the changes from the `c7c63bf80b3c6b8640b933e20229121b4edfc100` branch.

```typescript
    }

    if (isRebasing || numPatchesAfterCreate > 1) {
      savePatchApplicationState({
        packageDetails,
        patches: nextState,
        isRebasing: didFailWhileFinishingRebase,
      })
    } else {
      clearPatchApplicationState(packageDetails)
    }


```
