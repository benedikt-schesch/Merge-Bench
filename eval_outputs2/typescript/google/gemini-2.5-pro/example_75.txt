The merge conflict arises from two different approaches to setting the `fontFamily` style for the `ExpandedResponseContainer`. The `HEAD` branch introduces a conditional logic to switch between a serif and a default font family based on the `messageFont` variable, which is a clear feature enhancement. The other branch uses a simpler, direct assignment of the `fontFamily` variable.

The most logical resolution is to adopt the more advanced and flexible implementation from `HEAD`, as it semantically contains and enhances the functionality of the other branch. The comment from `HEAD` is also retained as it provides context for the `<Tabs>` component that follows.

```typescript
        width="80%"
        centered
        transitionName="animation-move-down"
        styles={{ body: { maxHeight: '80vh', overflow: 'auto' } }}>
        {expandedResponse && (
          <ExpandedResponseContainer
            style={{
              fontFamily: messageFont === 'serif' ? 'var(--font-family-serif)' : 'var(--font-family)',
              fontSize
            }}>
            {/* mode swtich tabs */}
            <Tabs
              tabBarExtraContent={
                <ActionButton
                  className="copy-expanded-button"
                  onClick={() => {
