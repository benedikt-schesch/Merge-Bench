Resolving semantic conflicts requires understanding the intent of the changes from both sides.

### Conflict 1: `@angular/cdk/testing` imports
*   **HEAD's intent:** To add the constant `NOV` to the list of imports.
*   **Incoming branch's (`7d443f98cf9f7fc4c9ddcb7abe45fa9bd4e9141c`) intent:** To add the constant `DEC` to the list of imports. The other symbols (`FEB`, `JAN`, `NOV`, `JUL`) are duplicates, likely from a previous messy merge or rebase.
*   **Resolution:** The correct resolution is to combine the unique additions from both branches. We will include both `NOV` and `DEC`, remove the duplicates from the incoming branch, and sort the entire list of imports alphabetically for better readability and consistency.

### Conflict 2: `@angular/core/testing` import
*   **HEAD's intent:** To ensure `async`, `ComponentFixture`, `inject`, and `TestBed` are imported from `@angular/core/testing`.
*   **Incoming branch's (`7d443f98cf9f7fc4c9ddcb7abe45fa9bd4e9141c`) intent:** The conflict marker is malformed, but it suggests this line was deleted in the incoming branch.
*   **Resolution:** Deleting an import statement is a potentially breaking change if those symbols are still used elsewhere in the file. Without the full file context, the safest action is to preserve the import statement from `HEAD`. This ensures no functionality is broken by the merge.

Based on this analysis, here is the resolved code:

```typescript
  dispatchMouseEvent,
  DEC,
  FEB,
  JAN,
  JUL,
  MockNgZone,
  NOV,
} from '@angular/cdk/testing';
import {DateAdapter} from '@angular/cdk/datetime';
import {Component, NgZone} from '@angular/core';
import {async, ComponentFixture, inject, TestBed} from '@angular/core/testing';
