An analysis of the two branches suggests that they are both trying to achieve the same goal: conditionally apply styles and an animation if the provided `optionsOrPlugin` argument is a configuration object rather than a plugin.

- The `HEAD` branch introduces a helper function `isPlugin()` for a more robust and explicit check. It also defines the styles in a `defaultStyleReset` object and then applies them, which is a clean separation of concerns.
- The `6c2a56a5f...` branch uses a simpler but potentially less accurate `typeof optionsOrPlugin !== "function"` check.

The approach in `HEAD` is semantically clearer and likely a deliberate improvement over the logic in the other branch. Therefore, the `HEAD` version is the correct resolution.

```typescript
    height: `${height}px`,
    margin: 0,
    pointerEvents: "none",
    transformOrigin: "center",
    zIndex: 100,
  }
  if (!isPlugin(optionsOrPlugin)) {
    Object.assign((el as HTMLElement).style, defaultStyleReset)
    animation = el.animate(
      [
        {
          transform: "scale(1)",
          opacity: 1,
