An analysis of the conflict reveals that one branch (`HEAD`) updated the implementation of the `doCleanup` function but failed to update the function signature accordingly, resulting in code that uses an undeclared variable `cleanIndexes`. The other branch (`e0ec8d42...`) provides a consistent function signature and body, introducing the `cleanIndexes` parameter and generalizing the `workspace` type to `BaseWorkspaceInfo`.

The semantic intent of the `e0ec8d42...` branch is clearer and self-consistent. The function's logic has evolved to always delete the workspace first, and then perform a reindex, with the boolean parameter controlling the reindexing behavior. The original comment, which described a conditional action based on a now-nonexistent `onlyDrop` parameter, is obsolete.

The resolution, therefore, is to adopt the function signature from the `e0ec8d42...` branch and update the documentation to accurately reflect the function's current behavior.

```typescript
  }

  /**
   * Drops a workspace from the database and then triggers a full reindex.
   */
  async doCleanup (ctx: MeasureContext, workspace: BaseWorkspaceInfo, cleanIndexes: boolean): Promise<void> {
    const { dbUrl } = prepareTools([])
    const adapter = getWorkspaceDestroyAdapter(dbUrl)
    await adapter.deleteWorkspace(ctx, sharedPipelineContextVars, workspace.uuid, workspace.dataId)

    await this.doReindexFulltext(ctx, workspace, cleanIndexes)

```
