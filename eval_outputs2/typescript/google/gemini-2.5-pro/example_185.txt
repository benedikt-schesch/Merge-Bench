An analysis of the conflict suggests that the incoming change (`e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce`) introduces a call to `this.googleClient.getMe()`. Although the result `me` is not used in the subsequent visible code, this call was likely added intentionally. It could serve as a pre-condition check to ensure the Google API client is authenticated and valid before attempting to update the database, which is a sensible pattern. The `HEAD` version lacks this check. Therefore, the most meaningful resolution is to incorporate the added line, preserving the likely intent of the incoming change.

```typescript
      workspace: this.user.workspace
    })
  }

  private async setCalendarHistoryId (historyId: string): Promise<void> {
    const me = await this.googleClient.getMe()
    await this.calendarHistories.updateOne(
      {
        userId: this.user.userId,
        workspace: this.user.workspace
      },

```
