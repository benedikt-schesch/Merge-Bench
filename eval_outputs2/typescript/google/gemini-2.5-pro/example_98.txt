An expert in semantic merge conflict resolution would analyze the intent behind the changes on both sides.

*   **`HEAD` side:** This side is importing a new type `IRoomCache` from a file named `api.js`. It also specifies the `.js` extension in its imports (`../Room.js` and `./driver/api.js`).
*   **`1a7da98...` side:** This side is importing a different new type `IRoomListingData` from a file named `interfaces`. It is also using a different import style that omits file extensions (`../Room` and `./driver/interfaces`). This is a common convention in TypeScript projects.

It's highly likely that both `IRoomCache` and `IRoomListingData` are new, distinct types required for features developed on their respective branches. A semantic resolution should therefore include both imports.

The conflict in style (with or without `.js` extension) should be resolved consistently. Since the `1a7da98...` side seems to be moving towards the more modern and common TypeScript convention of omitting file extensions, we will adopt that style for the merged code.

The correct resolution is to combine the unique imports from both branches while maintaining a consistent, modern import style.

```typescript
import * as matchMaker from '../MatchMaker.js';

import type { Room } from '../Room';
import { IRoomCache } from './driver/api';
import { IRoomListingData } from './driver/interfaces';

const LOBBY_CHANNEL = '$lobby';
