The `HEAD` version passes arguments directly, while the incoming change ensures all arguments are converted to strings before being passed to the locator method. This is a defensive measure to prevent errors if an argument is not a string (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, or a number). Since Playwright's locator methods generally expect string arguments, converting them explicitly is a safe and beneficial improvement. This resolution adopts the more robust approach.

```typescript
      try {
        await (
          locator[method as keyof Locator] as unknown as (
            ...args: string[]
          ) => Promise<void>
        )(...args.map((arg) => arg?.toString() || ""));
      } catch (e) {
        this.logger({
          category: "action",
          message: "error performing method",
          level: 1,
