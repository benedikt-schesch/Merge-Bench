It appears the two branches are attempting to check if a connected user is a "system" user, but they use different identifiers for this check.

*   The `HEAD` branch uses `systemAccountUuid`, suggesting the `getUser()` method returns a UUID.
*   The other branch uses `systemAccountEmail`, suggesting `getUser()` returns an email address.

Using a UUID is generally a more robust and stable way to identify an entity like a user account, as emails can change. It is likely that the change to use `systemAccountUuid` was a deliberate refactoring to improve the system. Therefore, I will resolve the conflict by using the `systemAccountUuid` check from the `HEAD` branch.

The second conflict is a simple newline difference. I will preserve the newline for better code formatting.

```typescript
      if (this.ticks % (60 * ticksPerSecond) === workspace.tickHash) {
        try {
          // update account lastVisit every minute per every workspace.‚àè
          let connected: boolean = false
          for (const val of workspace.sessions.values()) {
            if (val.session.getUser() !== systemAccountUuid) {
              connected = true
              break
            }
          }

```
