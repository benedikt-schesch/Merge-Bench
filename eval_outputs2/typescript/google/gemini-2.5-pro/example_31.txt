Resolving this merge conflict requires understanding the semantic intent of the changes from both branches.

1.  **Conflict 1 (Top of snippet):**
    ```typescript
      JUL,
    >>>>>>> 7d443f98cf9f7fc4c9ddcb7abe45fa9bd4e9141c
    } from '@angular/cdk/testing';
    ```
    This appears to be an incomplete conflict marker, likely from a `git` merge that was not resolved cleanly. The line `>>>>>>> 7d443f98cf9f7fc4c9ddcb7abe45fa9bd4e9141c` is a leftover artifact and should be removed. The line `JUL,` seems to be a valid addition to a multi-line import statement for constants (like months of the year) from `@angular/cdk/testing`. The intent is likely to add this constant.

2.  **Conflict 2 (Bottom of snippet):**
    ```typescript
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    import {async, ComponentFixture, inject, TestBed} from '@angular/core/testing';
    =======
    import {ComponentFixture, TestBed, async, inject} from '@angular/core/testing';
    >>>>>>> 7d443f98cf9f7fc4c9ddcb7abe45fa9bd4e9141c
    ```
    Here, both branches are importing the exact same set of tools: `async`, `ComponentFixture`, `inject`, and `TestBed`. The only difference is the order of the symbols within the import statement. This is a purely stylistic conflict. The `HEAD` version has the imports sorted alphabetically, which is a common and preferred code style.

**Resolution:**
The correct semantic resolution is to combine the intents: keep the addition of `JUL` from the first conflict and apply the cleaner, alphabetically-sorted import style from the second conflict.

```typescript
  JUL,
} from '@angular/cdk/testing';
import {DateAdapter} from '@angular/cdk/datetime';
import {Component, NgZone} from '@angular/core';
import {async, ComponentFixture, inject, TestBed} from '@angular/core/testing';
import {MatNativeDateModule} from '@angular/material/core';
import {By} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {MatCalendar} from './calendar';
import {MatDatepickerIntl} from './datepicker-intl';
import {MatDatepickerModule} from './datepicker-module';

```
