Resolving the conflict requires understanding the intent behind each change.

*   **HEAD (`<<<`):** This change initializes a new, empty Node.js project using the appropriate command for the package manager being tested (`npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`). The intent is to test the `import` functionality on a barebones project.
*   **Incoming change (`>>>`):** This change clones the `electron/electron-quick-start` repository, which is a simple but complete Electron application that does not use Electron Forge. The intent is to test the `import` functionality on a pre-existing, functional Electron project.

The purpose of the `import` command is to add Electron Forge to an *existing* project. While a newly initialized project is technically "existing," a more robust and common use case is importing a fully-formed Electron application like `electron-quick-start`. This makes for a more meaningful and realistic test. Therefore, the incoming change, which uses a real-world example project, is semantically preferable for testing the `import` feature.

```typescript

    describe('import', () => {
      before(async () => {
        dir = await ensureTestDirIsNonexistent();
        await fs.mkdir(dir);
        execSync(`git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start.git . --quiet`, {
          cwd: dir,
        });
      });

      it('creates forge.config.js and is packageable', async () => {

```
