Resolving this conflict requires analyzing the intent of both branches.

*   **`HEAD`'s intent:** This branch makes no changes within the `setEventHistoryId` function body before the database call. The function is simple and proceeds directly to the `updateOne` operation.
*   **The incoming branch's (`e0ec8d42...`) intent:** This branch adds a call to `this.googleClient.getMe()` and stores the result in a constant named `me`.

The key observation is that the newly declared `me` constant is **not used** anywhere in the subsequent code. This suggests two possibilities:
1.  The line is leftover from debugging or a partially implemented feature and should be removed.
2.  The call has an important side effect (like refreshing an authentication token) that is necessary before the `updateOne` call.

Without further context, the first possibility is more likely. Adding an asynchronous call that is not used makes the code less efficient and harder to understand. The most logical and clean resolution is to assume the line is dead code and omit it. The `HEAD` branch represents a complete and functional piece of logic, while the incoming change adds an unused variable.

Therefore, the conflict is resolved by accepting the `HEAD` version, which does not include the `getMe()` call.

```typescript
      workspace: this.user.workspace
    })
  }

  private async setEventHistoryId (calendarId: string, historyId: string): Promise<void> {
    await this.histories.updateOne(
      {
        calendarId,
        userId: this.user.userId,
        workspace: this.user.workspace

```
