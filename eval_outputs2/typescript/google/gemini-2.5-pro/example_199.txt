Based on an analysis of the conflict, the two branches disagree on the identifier to use when removing a client from the workspace.

-   **HEAD branch (`<... HEAD`)**: Uses `this.user.userId`.
-   **Incoming branch (`e0ec8d...`)**: Uses `this.user.email`.

**Semantic Intent:**
*   The `HEAD` branch's intent is to identify and remove the client using their `userId`. A `userId` is typically a stable, unique, and non-reusable identifier (like a UUID or database primary key), which is a common best practice.
*   The incoming branch's intent is to use the user's `email`. While often unique, emails can sometimes be changed by the user, making them a less stable identifier compared to a dedicated `userId`.

**Resolution:**
It is highly probable that the codebase is being standardized to use the more robust `userId` for identifying users. The `HEAD` branch likely reflects this newer, improved standard. The incoming branch was probably created before this standard was fully implemented and is therefore using an outdated identifier (`email`).

To maintain consistency and follow modern best practices, the resolution is to adopt the `userId` from the `HEAD` branch.

    if (integration !== undefined) {
      await this.client.update(integration, { disabled: true })
    }
    this.workspace.removeClient(this.user.userId)
  }

  private updateTimer (): void {
    clearTimeout(this.inactiveTimer)
    this.inactiveTimer = setTimeout(() => {
