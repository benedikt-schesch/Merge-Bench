Resolving the conflict requires choosing between two different signatures for the `getWorkspaceInfo` method call. The `HEAD` version calls it with two arguments, while the incoming version (`e0ec8d4...`) calls it with three arguments, prepending `this.ctx`.

The likely intent of the incoming change is a refactoring of the `getWorkspaceInfo` method to require a context object (`this.ctx`) as its first parameter. This is a common pattern for providing access to shared services, logging, or other contextual data. Omitting this new parameter would likely cause a compilation or runtime error. Therefore, the semantically correct resolution is to adopt the incoming change that includes `this.ctx` in the method call.

```typescript
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
              connected = true
              break
            }
          }
          void this.getWorkspaceInfo(this.ctx, workspace.token, connected).catch(() => {
            // Ignore
          })
        } catch (err: any) {
          // Ignore
        }
