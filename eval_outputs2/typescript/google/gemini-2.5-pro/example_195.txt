An analysis of the conflict reveals two different approaches to identifying the current user's integration.

-   The `HEAD` branch introduces a local variable `email` by calling `this.getEmail()` and then uses this variable to find a matching integration: `integrations.find((p) => p === email)`.
-   The other branch (`e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce`) uses the `me` parameter that is passed into the function: `integrations.find((p) => p === me)`.

The core of the issue lies in determining the correct identifier for the user's integration. The `integrations` array likely contains email addresses.

The `HEAD` branch's approach is more explicit and semantically sound. It retrieves an email via `this.getEmail()` and compares it to the integration identifiers (`p`), which are presumably also emails. This "email-to-email" comparison is type-safe in a semantic sense.

The other branch's use of the `me` parameter is more ambiguous. While `me` is a string, its specific format is unknown. It could be an email, but it could also be a different type of identifier (like a user ID or a UUID). Comparing a potentially non-email `me` string with an email from the `integrations` list could lead to a bug where the user's integration is never found.

Therefore, the most robust and likely correct resolution is to adopt the `HEAD` branch's change, as it ensures a semantically correct comparison. This resolves the conflict by favoring the more specific and safer implementation.

```typescript
  private getAttendees (event: Event, me: string): string[] {
    const res = new Set<string>()
    const email = this.getEmail()
    for (const participant of event.participants) {
      const integrations = this.workspace.integrations.byContact.get(participant) ?? []
      const integration = integrations.find((p) => p === email) ?? integrations[0]
      if (integration !== undefined && integration !== '') {
        res.add(integration)
      } else {
        const contact = this.workspace.contacts.byId.get(participant)
        if (contact !== undefined) {

```
