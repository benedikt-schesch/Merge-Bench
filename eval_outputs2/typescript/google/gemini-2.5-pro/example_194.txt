Resolving this merge conflict requires understanding the intent of both branches.

*   **The `HEAD` branch** introduced no changes in this section.
*   **The `e0ec8d42...` branch** is adding new functionality that requires several new imports: `GoogleClient`, `calendar_v3`, and `WatchController`.

Looking at the code context following the conflict, the line `private readonly calendar: calendar_v3.Calendar` makes it clear that the `import { calendar_v3 } from 'googleapis'` is necessary. The `GoogleClient` import is likely used elsewhere in the file for the same new functionality.

However, the `e0ec8d42...` branch also introduces a duplicate import for `WatchController`, which is already imported in the lines above the conflict.

The correct semantic resolution is to combine the intents: we keep the new necessary imports from the `e0ec8d42...` branch but remove the redundant `WatchController` import. The final code includes all necessary imports without duplication.

```typescript
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
import type { CalendarHistory, DummyWatch, EventHistory, Token, User } from './types'
import { encodeReccuring, isToken, parseRecurrenceStrings } from './utils'
import { WatchController } from './watch'
import type { WorkspaceClient } from './workspaceClient'
import { GoogleClient } from './googleClient'
import { calendar_v3 } from 'googleapis'

export class CalendarClient {
  private readonly calendar: calendar_v3.Calendar
  private readonly calendarHistories: Collection<CalendarHistory>
  private readonly histories: Collection<EventHistory>

```
