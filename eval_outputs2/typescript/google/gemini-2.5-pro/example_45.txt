The merge conflict appears to be between two branches making changes to the import statements at the top of a test file.

-   The `HEAD` branch has a set of imports including `act` from `@testing-library/react`, which is a common but older pattern. It also includes `TestBrowser`, `fireEvent`, `render`, and `React`.
-   The `100a96a...` branch has refactored the imports. It sources `act` from `react` (`import React, { act } from 'react'`), which is the modern and recommended approach for React 18+. It also adds a new import for `startMock` and moves the `// @ts-ignore` comment to the top of the file, likely to suppress a type warning for the newly added mock import. The file path was also renamed to use PascalCase (`User/Login`), which is a common convention.

The semantic intent of the `100a96a...` branch is to add a new feature (`startMock`) and modernize the testing imports. This set of changes is more comprehensive and up-to-date. The changes from `HEAD` are effectively superseded by the more modern refactoring in the other branch.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the changes from the `100a96a...` branch, as they encompass the necessary imports from both sides while using the current best practices.

```typescript
ï»¿// @ts-ignore
import { startMock } from '@@/requestRecordMock';
import { TestBrowser } from '@@/testBrowser';
import { fireEvent, render } from '@testing-library/react';
import React, { act } from 'react';
