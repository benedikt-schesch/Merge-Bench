Resolving this conflict requires understanding the signature of the `startSync` method. One branch calls it with no arguments, while the other passes a variable `me`.

The branch that passes `me` likely comes from a change where the `startSync` method was refactored to explicitly receive the user object (or ID) as a parameter, rather than implicitly relying on the class's internal state (`this.user`). This makes the dependency clearer and is a common refactoring pattern. Assuming the `me` variable is in scope (which it must have been for the code on that branch to be valid), preserving this more explicit call is the correct semantic merge.

```typescript
        value: this.user.userId
      })
    }

    void this.syncOurEvents().then(async () => {
      await this.startSync(me)
    })

    return this.user.userId
  }


```
