An analysis of the conflict reveals two primary intents. The `HEAD` branch has performed a refactoring, changing import paths and cleaning up unused imports. The `a5aac53666a8983bb54bba93a196daee2dc4a61c` branch is adding new functionality that requires `isRealNum`, `CustomLabel`, and `BaseMenuState`, while using the old, pre-refactor import paths.

A successful semantic merge should combine these intents: the new functionality from the incoming branch should be added, while respecting the refactoring from the `HEAD` branch.

1.  **`@univerjs/core` imports**: Both branches import `ICommandService`. The incoming branch also adds `isRealNum`. These should be merged into a single line.
2.  **Refactored Imports**: The `HEAD` branch has refactored paths for several components. The context shows `BaseMenuItem`, `BaseMenuProps`, `BaseMenuStyle` are now imported from `../../Interfaces/Menu` and `joinClassNames` is imported from `../../Utils/util`. Therefore, the corresponding old imports from `../../Interfaces` and `../../Utils` in the incoming branch are obsolete and should be discarded.
3.  **New Imports**: The incoming branch introduces new dependencies: `CustomLabel` and `BaseMenuState`.
    *   The `CustomLabel` import is new and should be kept.
    *   `BaseMenuState` was previously imported alongside `BaseMenuProps`, `BaseMenuItem`, etc. Following the refactoring pattern, its new location is logically `../../Interfaces/Menu`. It should be imported from this new path to maintain consistency with the rest of the file.

The resolved code combines these changes, preserving the refactoring while integrating the new features.

```typescript
import { Component, ComponentChild, createRef } from 'preact';
import { Subscription } from 'rxjs';
import { ICommandService, isRealNum } from '@univerjs/core';
import { CustomLabel } from '../CustomLabel';
import { BaseMenuState } from '../../Interfaces/Menu';
import styles from './index.module.less';
import { AppContext } from '../../Common/AppContext';
import { ICustomComponentOption, IDisplayMenuItem, IMenuItem, IValueOption, isValueOptions } from '../../services/menu/menu';
import { BaseMenuItem, BaseMenuProps, BaseMenuStyle } from '../../Interfaces/Menu';
import { joinClassNames } from '../../Utils/util';
