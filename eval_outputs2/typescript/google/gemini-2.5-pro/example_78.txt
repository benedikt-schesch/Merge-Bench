An analysis of the conflict suggests the following:
*   **HEAD**'s intent is to make `AnthropicClient` conform to the `LLMClient` contract, which is an interface, and explicitly set a `type` property as required by that interface.
*   **Incoming change (85483fe...)**'s intent is to refactor the architecture so that `AnthropicClient` inherits from a `LLMClient` base class. This is a common refactoring to move shared logic into a parent class.

The most logical resolution is to combine these intents. The change from an interface (`implements`) to a base class (`extends`) is a significant architectural shift. It is highly probable that the new `LLMClient` base class still requires child classes to specify their `type`. Therefore, we should adopt the inheritance pattern (`extends LLMClient`) and keep the `type` property definition.

```typescript
import { LogLine } from "../../types/log";
import { AvailableModel } from "../../types/model";
import { LLMCache } from "../cache/LLMCache";
import { ChatCompletionOptions, LLMClient } from "./LLMClient";

export class AnthropicClient extends LLMClient {
  public type: "anthropic" = "anthropic";
  private client: Anthropic;
  private cache: LLMCache | undefined;
  public logger: (message: LogLine) => void;
  private enableCaching: boolean;
