Resolving this merge conflict requires understanding the intent behind each change.

*   **HEAD** changes the logic to find the integration value by calling a method: `this.getEmail()`. This is a common refactoring pattern to encapsulate how a value is retrieved, making the code more maintainable and robust. For instance, the `getEmail()` method could contain logic to handle different user types or fallback mechanisms.
*   **e0ec8d42...** uses direct property access: `this.user.email`. This is more direct but less flexible than using a getter method.
*   There is also a whitespace conflict where **HEAD** adds a newline at the end of the function body for readability, which is a common coding style.

The most semantic resolution is to combine these intents by adopting the refactoring from HEAD. Using the `getEmail()` method is a clear improvement over direct property access. We will also keep the newline for better code formatting.

```typescript

  async cleanIntegration (): Promise<void> {
    const integration = await this.client.findOne(setting.class.Integration, {
      createdBy: this.user.userId,
      type: calendar.integrationType.Calendar,
      value: this.getEmail()
    })
    if (integration !== undefined) {
      await this.client.update(integration, { disabled: true })
    }

  }
