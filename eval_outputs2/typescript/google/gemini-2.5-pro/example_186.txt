The intent of the `HEAD` branch is to set a timer to periodically sync a calendar. The intent of the incoming branch `e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce` is to do the same, but it first makes a call to `this.googleClient.getMe()`.

Although the result of `getMe()` is not used in the subsequent lines, its inclusion is likely intentional. This call can serve as a liveness or authentication check to ensure the client is in a valid state before scheduling a long-term timer that runs 6 hours later. If the `getMe()` call fails, an exception would be thrown, preventing the timer from being set up for a session that is no longer valid. This is a sensible addition for robustness.

Therefore, the resolution is to include the line from the incoming branch.

```typescript
      await this.dummyWatch(calendarId)
    }
  }

  private async dummyWatch (calendarId: string): Promise<void> {
    const me = await this.googleClient.getMe()
    const timer = setTimeout(
      () => {
        void this.sync(calendarId)
      },
      6 * 60 * 60 * 1000

```
