The conflict arises from two separate changes: one branch refactored the menu service's types and filename (from `menu.ts` to `menu.service.ts`, and `IValueOption` to `IMenuItem`, etc.), while the other branch added a new import for `DisplayTypes` from a `Select` component.

The semantic intent of the first branch is to update the menu service's structure. The intent of the second is to add functionality related to a select component. A correct resolution will honor both intents by using the refactored menu service imports and also including the new `DisplayTypes` import.

```typescript
import { ComponentChildren, JSX } from 'preact';
import { BaseComponent, JSXComponent } from '../BaseComponent';
import { DisplayTypes } from '../Components/Select/Select';
import { IDisplayMenuItem, IMenuItem } from '../services/menu/menu.service';

export interface BaseMenuItem {
    className?: string;
    style?: JSX.CSSProperties;
    label?: ComponentChildren;

```
