Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add new migrations to what appears to be a migration list. The conflict occurs because both branches added different migrations at the same position in the array.

Based on the semantic intent - both sides want to include their respective migrations in the list - the resolution should include both migrations. Since these appear to be database migrations with timestamps, they should likely be ordered chronologically.

Examining the timestamps:
- `AddLockedColumnToProjectPlan1751878623268` (HEAD)
- `AddMcpsEnabled1751989232042` (merge branch)

The merge branch's migration has a later timestamp, so it should come after the HEAD's migration.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
                AddAgentsLimitToPlatformPlan1749917984363,
                AddAgentsEnabledToPlatformPlan1751309258332,
                AddTrialFlagInPlatform1751394161203,
                UpdateAiCredits1751404517528,
                AddAiOverageState1751466404493,
                AddLockedColumnToProjectPlan1751878623268,
                AddMcpsEnabled1751989232042,
            )
            break
        case ApEdition.COMMUNITY:
            commonMigration.push(
                AddPlatformToPostgres1709052740378,
