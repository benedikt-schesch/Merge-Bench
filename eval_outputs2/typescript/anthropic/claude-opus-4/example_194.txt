Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import necessary dependencies, but there's some duplication and reorganization happening.

From the conflict, I can see:
- Both sides want to import `WatchController` from './watch'
- The incoming changes (after `=======`) additionally want to import `GoogleClient` and `calendar_v3`
- The current branch (before `=======`) has a cleaner import structure

The semantic intent appears to be adding the Google-related imports while maintaining the existing imports. Here's the resolved version:

```typescript
import type { CalendarHistory, DummyWatch, EventHistory, Token, User } from './types'
import { encodeReccuring, isToken, parseRecurrenceStrings } from './utils'
import { WatchController } from './watch'
import type { WorkspaceClient } from './workspaceClient'
import { GoogleClient } from './googleClient'
import { calendar_v3 } from 'googleapis'

export class CalendarClient {
  private readonly calendar: calendar_v3.Calendar
  private readonly calendarHistories: Collection<CalendarHistory>
  private readonly histories: Collection<EventHistory>

```
