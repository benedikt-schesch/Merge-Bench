Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the `HEAD` branch doesn't have the `closeTimer` property, while the incoming branch (`e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce`) is adding it.

From a semantic perspective, this appears to be a simple addition where the incoming branch is introducing a new timer property, likely for managing cleanup or timeout functionality. There's no conflicting logic between the two sides - one side simply has an additional property declaration that the other doesn't.

The resolution should include the `closeTimer` property to preserve the functionality being introduced by the incoming branch.

```typescript
  CalendarClient | Promise<CalendarClient>
  >()

  private readonly syncHistory: Collection<SyncHistory>
  private readonly tokens: Collection<Token>
  private closeTimer: NodeJS.Timeout | undefined = undefined
  private channels = new Map<Ref<Channel>, Channel>()
  private readonly calendarsByGoogleId = new Map<PersonId, ExternalCalendar[]>()
  readonly calendars = {
    byId: new Map<Ref<ExternalCalendar>, ExternalCalendar>(),
    byExternal: new Map<string, ExternalCalendar[]>()

```
