Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides of the merge are trying to add new language imports to the same location in the file. The HEAD branch is adding Dutch (nl) language support, while the other branch is adding Polish (pl) language support.

Since both changes are additive and non-conflicting in terms of functionality (they're just adding different language imports), the semantic intent is to include both languages. The resolution should preserve both imports in alphabetical order.

```typescript
import {messages as messagesHu} from '#/locale/locales/hu/messages'
import {messages as messagesId} from '#/locale/locales/id/messages'
import {messages as messagesIt} from '#/locale/locales/it/messages'
import {messages as messagesJa} from '#/locale/locales/ja/messages'
import {messages as messagesKo} from '#/locale/locales/ko/messages'
import {messages as messagesNl} from '#/locale/locales/nl/messages'
import {messages as messagesPl} from '#/locale/locales/pl/messages'
import {messages as messagesPt_BR} from '#/locale/locales/pt-BR/messages'
import {messages as messagesRu} from '#/locale/locales/ru/messages'
import {messages as messagesTh} from '#/locale/locales/th/messages'
import {messages as messagesTr} from '#/locale/locales/tr/messages'
import {messages as messagesUk} from '#/locale/locales/uk/messages'

```
