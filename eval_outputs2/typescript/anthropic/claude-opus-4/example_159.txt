Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to access the same property but with slightly different syntax:

- HEAD uses bracket notation: `relayConnetion.fields['edges']`
- The other branch uses dot notation: `relayConnetion.fields.edges`

Both achieve the same semantic intent - checking if the 'edges' field exists. Since the surrounding code consistently uses bracket notation (as seen in lines like `relayConnetion.fields['edges'].type` and `relayEdge.fields['node'].type`), I'll resolve this by maintaining consistency with bracket notation:

```typescript
        return;

      //FIXME: additional checks
      const relayConnetion = field.type;

      if (!relayConnetion.fields['edges']) return;

      relayConnetion.isRelayType = true;
      const relayEdge = relayConnetion.fields['edges'].type;
      relayEdge.isRelayType = true;
      const realType = relayEdge.fields['node'].type;

```
