Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve similar imports but with slight differences:

1. **Import order**: HEAD has dayjs first, while the other branch has parse first
2. **Import source**: HEAD uses 'url' while the other branch uses 'node:url' (Node.js protocol prefix)
3. **Type imports**: HEAD uses regular imports while the other branch uses `type` keyword for Request and Response

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both want to import the same modules
- The other branch is using more modern Node.js conventions (node: prefix and type imports)

Here's the resolved conflict, adopting the more modern approach while maintaining a logical import order:

```typescript
import { parse } from 'node:url';
import dayjs from 'dayjs';
import type { Request, Response } from 'express';

// mock tableListDataSource
const genList = (current: number, pageSize: number) => {
  const tableListDataSource: API.RuleListItem[] = [];


```
