Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - generating a token with empty string as the first parameter and some form of workspace identifier as the second parameter.

The HEAD version uses:
- `'' as PersonUuid` for the first parameter
- `'latest' as WorkspaceUuid` for the second parameter

The incoming version uses:
- `''` for the first parameter (without type assertion)
- `getWorkspaceId('latest')` for the second parameter

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both want to create a token with an empty person identifier and a workspace identifier for 'latest'. The incoming version seems more elegant as it uses a helper function `getWorkspaceId()` rather than a direct type assertion.

Here's the resolution that preserves the intent while using the cleaner approach:

```typescript
    accountsUrl: '',
    externalStorage: createDummyStorageAdapter()
  })

  function connect (): WebSocket {
    const token: string = generateToken('', getWorkspaceId('latest'))
    return new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:${port}/${token}`)
  }

  afterAll(async () => {
    await cancelOp.shutdown()
```
