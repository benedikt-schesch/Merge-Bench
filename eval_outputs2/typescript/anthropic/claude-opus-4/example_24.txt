Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - hiding the page initially and then showing it after a timeout. The differences are:

1. `Raw` vs `JSX.Raw` - The incoming change uses the `JSX.` prefix
2. `typeof app!=="undefined"` vs `app` - Different ways to check if `app` exists

The second change is more idiomatic and cleaner. Since both achieve the same goal, I'll resolve by accepting the incoming changes as they represent better code practices:

```typescript
                {/* Hide the entire page for up to 0.5 seconds so that if navigating between pages on a fast */}
                {/* device the navigation pane doesn't appear to flash if it loads just after the page displays. */}
                {/* This could still happen if we're unlucky, but from experimenting with Firefox's throttling */}
                {/* settings, this appears to be a reasonable tradeoff between displaying page content without the */}
                {/* navigation on exceptionally slow connections and not having the navigation obviously repaint. */}
                <JSX.Raw html='document.body.style.display="none";' />
                <JSX.Raw html='setTimeout(() => app?app.showPage():document.body.style.removeProperty("display"),500)' />
            </script>
            {context.toolbar(props)}

            <div class="container container-main">
                <div class="col-content">

```
