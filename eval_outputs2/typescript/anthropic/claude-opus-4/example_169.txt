Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - measuring the time delta for message sending. The key difference is:

- HEAD uses `platformNow()` to get the start time
- The incoming branch uses `Date.now()` to calculate the delta, but references an undefined variable `st`

The incoming branch appears to have an error since `st` is not defined in its version. The HEAD version is complete and correct - it defines `st` using `platformNow()` and then uses it consistently.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript

      let sendMsg = smsg
      if (_compression) {
        sendMsg = await compress(smsg)
      }
      const st = platformNow()
      await new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
        const handleErr = (err?: Error): void => {
          ctx.measure('msg-send-delta', platformNow() - st)
          if (err != null) {
            if (!`${err.message}`.includes('WebSocket is not open')) {
              ctx.error('send error', { err })
              Analytics.handleError(err)
            }

```
