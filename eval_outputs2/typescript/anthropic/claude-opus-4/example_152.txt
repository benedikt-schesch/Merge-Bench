Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import PDF-related libraries but using different packages:

- HEAD is importing `PDFParser from "pdf2json"` (along with mime-types and path)
- The other branch is importing `pdf from "pdf-parse"`

Both libraries serve similar purposes (parsing PDF files) but have different APIs. Since both sides appear to want PDF parsing functionality, and without more context about which specific API the rest of the codebase expects, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";
import { WriteImageResponse } from "pdf2pic/dist/types/convertResponse";
import axios from "axios";
import fs from "fs-extra";
import heicConvert from "heic-convert";
<<<<<<< HEAD
import mime from "mime-types";
import path from "path";
import PDFParser from "pdf2json";
=======
import pdf from "pdf-parse";
>>>>>>> 7f7da99994351d83a61bb7a72879195c87f50456
import xlsx from "xlsx";

import { isValidUrl } from "./common";
import { ExcelSheetContent, Page, PageStatus } from "../types";
