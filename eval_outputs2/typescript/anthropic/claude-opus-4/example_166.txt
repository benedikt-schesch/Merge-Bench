Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD** (current branch): The `sessionFactory` takes 3 parameters: `token`, `workspace`, and `account`
- **Incoming change** (e0ec8d42...): The `sessionFactory` takes 2 parameters: `token` and `workspace`

This appears to be a conflict where one side added an `account` parameter to the `ClientSession` constructor while the other side didn't. Without additional context about the `ClientSession` class definition and which version is correct, I cannot determine the proper resolution.

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
          return { docs: [] }
        },
        loadModel: async (ctx, lastModelTx, hash) => []
      }
    },
<<<<<<< HEAD
    sessionFactory: (token, workspace, account) => new ClientSession(token, workspace, account, true),
=======
    sessionFactory: (token, workspace) => new ClientSession(token, workspace, true),
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
    port,
    brandingMap: {},
    serverFactory: startHttpServer,
    accountsUrl: '',
    externalStorage: createDummyStorageAdapter()
```
