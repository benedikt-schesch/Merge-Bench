Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import functions from 'react-native-reanimated', but they appear to be using different versions of the library:

- HEAD is using newer Reanimated v2 API with hooks like `useAnimatedScrollHandler`, `useSharedValue`, `useAnimatedRef`
- The other branch is using older Reanimated v1 API with `event`, `useCode`, `onChange`, `set`, `call`

Since this appears to be a migration from Reanimated v1 to v2, and HEAD contains the newer API, I'll resolve in favor of HEAD's imports:

```typescript
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import { findNodeHandle } from 'react-native';
import {
  useAnimatedScrollHandler,
  useSharedValue,
  useAnimatedRef,
} from 'react-native-reanimated';
import { useBottomSheetInternal } from '../hooks/useBottomSheetInternal';
import type { Scrollable, ScrollableType } from '../types';

export const useScrollableInternal = (type: ScrollableType) => {
  // refs

```
