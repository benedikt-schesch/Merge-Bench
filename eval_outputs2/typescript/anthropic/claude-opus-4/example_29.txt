Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add dependencies to the constructor, but they have different sets of dependencies:

- HEAD version: adds `elementRef: ElementRef`
- Incoming version: adds `elementRef: ElementRef`, `analytics: Analytics`, and `renderer: Renderer2`

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to add `elementRef: ElementRef`
2. The incoming change also wants to add analytics and renderer services
3. The `ngOnInit` method is using `this.analytics.trackPageViews()`, which requires the analytics service

Since the code in `ngOnInit` references `this.analytics`, we need the Analytics service from the incoming change. The renderer might also be needed elsewhere in the component. Therefore, the proper resolution is to accept all the dependencies from the incoming version.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript


  constructor(private docsService: DocsService,
              private router: Router,
              private route: ActivatedRoute,
              private elementRef: ElementRef,
              private analytics: Analytics,
              private renderer: Renderer2) {
  }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.analytics.trackPageViews();
  }

```
