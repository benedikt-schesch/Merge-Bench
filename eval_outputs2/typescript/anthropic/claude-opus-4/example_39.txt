Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import from `@umijs/max`, but with slightly different sets of imports and ordering. The conflict appears to be about:

1. **HEAD** wants to include `useEmotionCss` and has a specific order
2. **The other branch** wants to include `history` and has a different order

Since both sides seem to have valid imports that serve different purposes (styling with emotion vs navigation with history), and the file paths also differ (suggesting a restructuring), I'll merge both sets of imports to preserve the intent of both changes:

```typescript
  LoginForm,
  ProFormCaptcha,
  ProFormCheckbox,
  ProFormText,
} from '@ant-design/pro-components';
import { useEmotionCss } from '@ant-design/use-emotion-css';
import { FormattedMessage, Helmet, history, SelectLang, useIntl, useModel } from '@umijs/max';
import { Alert, message, Tabs } from 'antd';
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';
import Settings from '../../../../config/defaultSettings';

```
