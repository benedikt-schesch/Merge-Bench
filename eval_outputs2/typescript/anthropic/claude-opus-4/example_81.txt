Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add imports after the same import statement from `@renderer/config/constant`. 

The HEAD branch is adding:
- Three functions from `@renderer/config/models`
- `codeThemes` from `@renderer/context/SyntaxHighlighterProvider`

The incoming branch (75f25d8a) is adding:
- `useCodeStyle` from `@renderer/context/CodeStyleProvider`

These imports appear to be for different purposes and don't conflict semantically. Both sets of imports should be included in the merged result.

```typescript
  DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS,
  DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE,
  isMac,
  isWindows
} from '@renderer/config/constant'
import {
  isOpenAIModel,
  isSupportedFlexServiceTier,
  isSupportedReasoningEffortOpenAIModel
} from '@renderer/config/models'
import { codeThemes } from '@renderer/context/SyntaxHighlighterProvider'
import { useCodeStyle } from '@renderer/context/CodeStyleProvider'
import { useAssistant } from '@renderer/hooks/useAssistant'
import { useProvider } from '@renderer/hooks/useProvider'
import { useSettings } from '@renderer/hooks/useSettings'
import { SettingDivider, SettingRow, SettingRowTitle } from '@renderer/pages/settings'
import AssistantSettingsPopup from '@renderer/pages/settings/AssistantSettings'

```
