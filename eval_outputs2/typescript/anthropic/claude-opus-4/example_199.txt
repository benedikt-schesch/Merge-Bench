Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call `removeClient` on `this.workspace`, but they're using different identifiers:
- HEAD uses `this.user.userId`
- The incoming change uses `this.user.email`

Without more context about the system's design and whether `removeClient` expects a userId or email, I cannot determine which is semantically correct. The conflict appears to be a genuine disagreement about which identifier should be used.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
    })
    if (integration !== undefined) {
      await this.client.update(integration, { disabled: true })
    }
<<<<<<< HEAD
    this.workspace.removeClient(this.user.userId)
=======
    this.workspace.removeClient(this.user.email)
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
  }

  private updateTimer (): void {
    clearTimeout(this.inactiveTimer)
    this.inactiveTimer = setTimeout(() => {
