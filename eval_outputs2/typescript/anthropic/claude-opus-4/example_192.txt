Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to improve error handling in the catch block. The key differences are:

1. **HEAD**: Uses `err` without type annotation and logs the entire error object
2. **Incoming change**: Uses `err: any` with explicit type annotation and logs only `err.message`

The semantic intent of both changes is to improve error logging. The incoming change is more specific by:
- Adding TypeScript type annotation (`any`) for better type safety
- Logging only the error message instead of the entire error object, which is often more readable in logs

Since the incoming change represents a more refined approach to error handling with better TypeScript practices and cleaner logging, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```typescript
    try {
      const _calendar = this.workspace.calendars.byId.get(event.calendar as Ref<ExternalCalendar>)
      if (_calendar !== undefined) {
        await this.remove(event.eventId, _calendar.externalId)
      }
    } catch (err: any) {
      console.error('Remove event error', this.user.workspace, this.user.userId, err.message)
    }
  }

  async syncOurEvents (): Promise<void> {
    this.updateTimer()

```
