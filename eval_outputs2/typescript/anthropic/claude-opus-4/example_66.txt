Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the constructor parameter type for `_channel`. 

- HEAD uses `types.ChannelDefinition`
- The incoming change uses `types.ApiChannelDefinition`

Since this appears to be a type rename/refactoring where `ChannelDefinition` is being renamed to `ApiChannelDefinition` (likely to be more specific about its purpose), I'll resolve by accepting the incoming change which represents the newer, more descriptive type name.

```typescript
}

class ChannelModule extends Module {
  private _messagesModule: MessagesModule

  public constructor(
    channelName: string,
    private _channel: types.ApiChannelDefinition
  ) {
    super({
      path: INDEX_FILE,
      exportName: strings.varName(channelName),
    })


```
