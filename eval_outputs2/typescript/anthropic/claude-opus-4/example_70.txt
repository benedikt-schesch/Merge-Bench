Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define a type `GetChannelByName` but with slight differences:

1. **HEAD**: Uses `BaseChannelDefinition` which is defined locally in this file as `common.BaseIntegration['channels'][string]`
2. **Incoming change**: Uses `common.ChannelDefinition` directly from the common types

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both are trying to cast the channel to a proper channel definition type. The incoming change seems to be using a more direct approach by referencing `common.ChannelDefinition` which is likely the canonical definition from the types module, while HEAD creates a local alias.

Given that the incoming change is more direct and avoids creating an unnecessary local type alias, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```typescript
import * as common from '../types'

type BaseChannelDefinition = common.BaseIntegration['channels'][string]
type GetChannelByName<
  TIntegration extends common.BaseIntegration,
  TChannelName extends keyof TIntegration['channels'],
> = utils.Cast<TIntegration['channels'][TChannelName], common.ChannelDefinition>

/**
 * @deprecated Integration's should no longer use their name as prefix for event types or tags.
 */
type WithRequiredPrefix<TTags extends string, TPrefix extends string> = string extends TTags

```
