Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import from `./Protocol`, but with slight differences:

- HEAD: imports `ErrorCode` and `Protocol` from `'./Protocol.js'` (with `.js` extension)
- The other branch: imports `EventEmitter` from `'events'` and `ErrorCode`, `Protocol` from `'./Protocol'` (without `.js` extension)

The semantic intent from both sides appears to be:
1. Both want to import `ErrorCode` and `Protocol` from the Protocol module
2. The incoming branch also needs `EventEmitter` from the 'events' module
3. There's a difference in module resolution style (.js extension vs no extension)

Looking at the context, the other imports in the file use `.js` extensions (like `'./IPC.js'` and `'./utils/Utils.js'`), so for consistency, I'll preserve the `.js` extension pattern.

Here's the resolved version:

```typescript
import { EventEmitter } from 'events';
import { ErrorCode, Protocol } from './Protocol.js';

import { requestFromIPC, subscribeIPC } from './IPC.js';

import { Deferred, generateId, merge, retry, MAX_CONCURRENT_CREATE_ROOM_WAIT_TIME, REMOTE_ROOM_SHORT_TIMEOUT } from './utils/Utils.js';
import { isDevMode, cacheRoomHistory, getPreviousProcessId, getRoomRestoreListKey, reloadFromCache } from './utils/DevMode.js';

```
