Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call `getWorkspaceInfo` but with different parameters:

- HEAD (left side): calls with just `rawToken`
- Incoming (right side): calls with `ctx`, `rawToken`, and a boolean expression `token.email !== systemAccountEmail`

The semantic intent appears to be that the method signature for `getWorkspaceInfo` has been updated to require additional parameters - specifically a context (`ctx`) and a boolean flag that checks if the token email is not the system account email.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```typescript
  ): Promise<AddSessionResponse> {
    const { workspace: workspaceUuid } = token

    let workspaceInfo: WorkspaceInfoWithStatus | undefined
    try {
      workspaceInfo = await this.getWorkspaceInfo(ctx, rawToken, token.email !== systemAccountEmail)
    } catch (err: any) {
      this.updateConnectErrorInfo(token)
      return { error: err }
    }


```

The resolution accepts the incoming changes since they represent an evolution of the API that adds necessary context and authorization checking.
