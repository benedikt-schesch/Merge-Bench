Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different imports to the same file:

- HEAD is trying to import `getDefaultModel` from the AssistantService
- The other branch is trying to import `CollapsibleSettingGroup` from the SettingGroup

Since these are two different imports that serve different purposes and don't conflict with each other semantically, the resolution should include both imports.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
import { useAssistant } from '@renderer/hooks/useAssistant'
import { useProvider } from '@renderer/hooks/useProvider'
import { useSettings } from '@renderer/hooks/useSettings'
import { SettingDivider, SettingRow, SettingRowTitle } from '@renderer/pages/settings'
import AssistantSettingsPopup from '@renderer/pages/settings/AssistantSettings'
import { getDefaultModel } from '@renderer/services/AssistantService'
import { CollapsibleSettingGroup } from '@renderer/pages/settings/SettingGroup'
import { useAppDispatch } from '@renderer/store'
import {
  SendMessageShortcut,
  setAutoTranslateWithSpace,
  setCodeCollapsible,

```
