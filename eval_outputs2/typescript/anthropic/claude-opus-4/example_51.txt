Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to register keyboard listeners, but they differ in which keys they're listening for:

- HEAD wants to listen for: `["a", "r", "PageDown", "PageUp"]`
- The incoming branch wants to listen for: `["a", "r"]`

Since HEAD is adding additional functionality (PageDown/PageUp keys) while maintaining the existing keys (a, r), and there's no indication that removing these keys was intentional, the semantic intent appears to be to expand the keyboard functionality rather than restrict it.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, [startTime]);

  // keyboard

  useKeyboardListener(["a", "r", "PageDown", "PageUp"], (key, modifiers) => {
    if (modifiers.repeat || !modifiers.down) {
      return;
    }

    switch (key) {

```
