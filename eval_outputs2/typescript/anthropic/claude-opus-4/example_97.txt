Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the `allowReconnection` call, but they have different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Simply calls `await this.allowReconnection(client, 1);`
- **Incoming change**: Wraps the same call in a try-catch block and resolves `onLeaveFinished` promise in the catch block

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to allow reconnection when a client leaves
2. The incoming change adds error handling and ensures that `onLeaveFinished` is resolved even if `allowReconnection` throws an error

Since the incoming change provides more robust error handling and ensures the promise resolution, it seems to be the more complete solution. Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
                return onJoinFinished;
              }
              async onLeave(client) {
                onLeaveCalled = Date.now();
                // if left early - allow reconnection should be no-op
                try {
                  await this.allowReconnection(client, 1);
                } catch (e) {
                  onLeaveFinished.resolve(true);
                }
              }
              onDispose() { onRoomDisposed.resolve(true); }
            });

            // Close WebSocket connetion before `onJoin` completes

```
