Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different imports from `useElectron()`:

- HEAD wants to add `getPageTitle`
- The incoming branch wants to add `addIpcListener` and `removeIpcListener`

Since both sides are adding different, non-conflicting functionality (page title handling vs IPC listener handling), the semantic intent is to include all of these imports. Here's the resolved version:

```typescript
    addDownloadItem,
    addDownloadItems,
    downloadItemsNow,
    downloadNow,
    getLocalIP,
    getPageTitle,
    addIpcListener,
    removeIpcListener,
  } = useElectron();
  const appStore = useAppStore(useShallow(appStoreSelector));
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  const [localIP, setLocalIP] = useState<string>("");
  const newFormRef = useRef<DownloadFormRef>(null);

```
