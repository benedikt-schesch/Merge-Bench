Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. **HEAD** (current branch) has:
   - A more complex `fontFamily` style that conditionally uses either a serif or default font family based on `messageFont`
   - Includes a comment `{/* mode switch tabs */}`
   - The `<Tabs>` component is inside the container

2. **Incoming change** (5d3b751aa0f9ff61b02b5d02fd343ed58478b8b6) has:
   - A simpler `fontFamily` style that just uses the `fontFamily` variable
   - The `<Tabs>` component follows immediately after the container opening

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to apply font styling to the `ExpandedResponseContainer`
- Both sides have the `<Tabs>` component as the content
- The HEAD version has more sophisticated font handling logic and includes a helpful comment

The resolution should preserve the more complete implementation from HEAD:

```typescript
        width="80%"
        centered
        transitionName="animation-move-down"
        styles={{ body: { maxHeight: '80vh', overflow: 'auto' } }}>
        {expandedResponse && (
          <ExpandedResponseContainer
            style={{
              fontFamily: messageFont === 'serif' ? 'var(--font-family-serif)' : 'var(--font-family)',
              fontSize
            }}>
            {/* mode swtich tabs */}
            <Tabs
              tabBarExtraContent={
                <ActionButton
                  className="copy-expanded-button"
                  onClick={() => {

```
