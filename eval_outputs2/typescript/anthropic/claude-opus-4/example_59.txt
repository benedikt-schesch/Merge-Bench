Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to add support for different languages to what appears to be a language mapping function. The HEAD branch is adding Dutch ('nl') support while the other branch is adding Polish ('pl') support.

Since both changes represent valid additions of new language support and they don't conflict semantically (they're just adding different languages), the resolution should include both additions, maintaining alphabetical order based on the language codes.

```typescript
        return AppLanguage.it
      case 'ja':
        return AppLanguage.ja
      case 'ko':
        return AppLanguage.ko
      case 'nl':
        return AppLanguage.nl
      case 'pl':
        return AppLanguage.pl
      case 'pt-BR':
        return AppLanguage.pt_BR
      case 'ru':
        return AppLanguage.ru
      case 'th':

```
