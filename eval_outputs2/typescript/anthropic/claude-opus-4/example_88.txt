Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import types and the zod library, but with different naming conventions and import styles:

- **HEAD**: Uses `WanVdeoGenInput` (which appears to have a typo - "Vdeo" instead of "Video") and imports zod as `* as z from 'zod/v4'`
- **Other branch**: Uses `CivitaiWanVideoGenInput` (with proper "Video" spelling and "Civitai" prefix) and imports zod as `z from 'zod'`

The semantic intent appears to be importing a video generation input type from the Civitai client along with zod for schema validation. The more complete and correct version seems to be from the other branch, as it:
1. Has the correct spelling of "Video"
2. Uses a more descriptive type name with the "Civitai" prefix
3. Uses the simpler zod import without version locking

Here's the resolved conflict:

```typescript
import type { CivitaiWanVideoGenInput } from '@civitai/client';
import z from 'zod';
import { AspectRatioMap, AspectRatio } from '~/libs/generation/utils/AspectRatio';
import { VideoGenerationConfig2 } from '~/server/orchestrator/infrastructure/GenerationConfig';
import {
  seedSchema,
  promptSchema,

```
