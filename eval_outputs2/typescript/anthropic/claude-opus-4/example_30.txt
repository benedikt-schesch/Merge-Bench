Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import month constants from `@angular/cdk/testing`. 

The HEAD side has:
- `FEB`, `JAN`, `JUL`, `MockNgZone`, `NOV`

The other side (7d443f98cf9f7fc4c9ddcb7abe45fa9bd4e9141c) has:
- `DEC`, `FEB`, `JAN`, `NOV`, `JUL`

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want the same months (FEB, JAN, JUL, NOV)
2. The other side additionally wants to import `DEC`
3. HEAD has `MockNgZone` which the other side doesn't explicitly list (but it might already be there)

The resolution should include all unique imports from both sides. Here's the resolved version:

```typescript
  dispatchMouseEvent,
  DEC,
  FEB,
  JAN,
  JUL,
  MockNgZone,
  NOV,
} from '@angular/cdk/testing';
import {DateAdapter} from '@angular/cdk/datetime';
import {Component, NgZone} from '@angular/core';
import {async, ComponentFixture, inject, TestBed} from '@angular/core/testing';

```
