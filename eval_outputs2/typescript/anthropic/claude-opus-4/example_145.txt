Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - allowing fullscreen on the iframe element. The only difference is:

- HEAD uses the React convention `allowFullScreen` (without a value, which defaults to true)
- The other branch uses `allowFullScreen={true}` with an explicit true value and a self-closing `></iframe>` tag

Since both achieve the same semantic intent, I'll resolve this by using the more concise React convention from HEAD, which is also more idiomatic:

```typescript
          height="315"
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_An9EsKPhp0"
          title="Explain Like I'm 5: Docusaurus"
          frameBorder="0"
          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
          allowFullScreen
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


```
