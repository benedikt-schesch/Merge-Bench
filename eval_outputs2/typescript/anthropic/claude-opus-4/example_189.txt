Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to log an error, with the only difference being:
- HEAD logs the entire `err` object
- The incoming change logs `err.message`

From a semantic perspective, the incoming change appears to be an improvement as it's more specific about what to log (just the error message rather than the entire error object, which could be verbose or contain sensitive information).

Here's the resolved conflict:

```typescript
      if (err?.response?.status === 410) {
        await this.eventsSync(calendarId)
        return
      }
      await this.googleClient.checkError(err)
      console.error('Event sync error', this.user.workspace, this.user.userId, err.message)
    }
  }

  private async syncEvent (calendarId: string, event: calendar_v3.Schema$Event, accessRole: string): Promise<void> {
    this.updateTimer()

```
