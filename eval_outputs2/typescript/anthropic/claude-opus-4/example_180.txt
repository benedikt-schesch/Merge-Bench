Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD (current branch) adds a console.warn statement when a calendar is not found
- The incoming branch (e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce) removes that warning

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants to provide debugging information when a calendar lookup fails
- The incoming branch wants to handle the undefined case silently

Since both sides agree on the control flow (returning undefined when calendar is not found), and the only difference is whether to log a warning, I'll resolve this by keeping the warning as it provides useful debugging information without changing the behavior:

```typescript
    id: Ref<ExternalCalendar>,
    create: boolean = false
  ): Promise<CalendarClient | undefined> {
    const calendar = this.calendars.byId.get(id)
    if (calendar === undefined) {
      console.warn("couldn't find calendar by id", id)
      return
    }
    const client = this.clients.get(calendar.externalUser)
    if (client instanceof Promise) {
      return await client
```
