Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to handle the error case in the catch block, with slight differences:

**HEAD (left side):**
- Logs "Error parsing log line" with `console.log`
- Then logs the error with `console.error(e)`
- Returns `logLine` without type assertion

**Incoming (right side):**
- Logs a combined error message with `console.error`
- Returns `logLine as LogLineEval` with explicit type assertion

The semantic intent of both sides is the same: log the error and return the original logLine. The incoming change is cleaner with a single console.error statement and includes the type assertion which is more explicit about the return type.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
              entry.type === "object" ? JSON.parse(entry.value) : entry.value,
            ]),
          )
        : undefined,
    } as LogLineEval;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error parsing log line:`, logLine);
    return logLine as LogLineEval;
  }
}

export class EvalLogger {
  logs: LogLineEval[] = [];

```
