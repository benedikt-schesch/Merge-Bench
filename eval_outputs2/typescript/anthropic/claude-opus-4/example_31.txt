Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import the same testing utilities from `@angular/core/testing`, but with different ordering. This is a common formatting/style conflict where both sides have the same imports but arranged differently.

The semantic intent is the same - both sides want to import `async`, `ComponentFixture`, `inject`, and `TestBed`. The only difference is the order of these imports.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
  JUL,
} from '@angular/cdk/testing';
import {DateAdapter} from '@angular/cdk/datetime';
import {Component, NgZone} from '@angular/core';
import {ComponentFixture, TestBed, async, inject} from '@angular/core/testing';
import {MatNativeDateModule} from '@angular/material/core';
import {By} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {MatCalendar} from './calendar';
import {MatDatepickerIntl} from './datepicker-intl';
import {MatDatepickerModule} from './datepicker-module';

```

I chose the ordering from the second branch (`ComponentFixture, TestBed, async, inject`) as it follows a more logical grouping with the main testing fixtures first, followed by utilities.
