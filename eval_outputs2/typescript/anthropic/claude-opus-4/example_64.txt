Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different import statements at the top of the file. The HEAD branch wants to import `resolveInterface` from a local module, while the other branch wants to import the `esbuild` type definitions.

Since these are two different imports serving different purposes, and there's no semantic conflict between them (they're not trying to import the same thing differently), the resolution should include both imports.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
import { resolveInterface } from 'src/interface/resolve'
import type * as esbuild from 'esbuild'
import { InterfacePackage } from '../../package'
import * as utils from '../../utils'
import { mergeObjectSchemas, z } from '../../zui'
import { SchemaStore, BrandedSchema, createStore, isBranded, getName } from './branded-schema'
import { BaseConfig, BaseEvents, BaseActions, BaseChannels, BaseStates, BaseEntities, BaseConfigs } from './generic'
```
