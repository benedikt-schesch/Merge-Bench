Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import functions from 'vue-demi', but with different sets of imports:

- HEAD (current branch): imports `getCurrentScope`, `onScopeDispose`, `ref`, `watchSyncEffect`
- Incoming branch: imports `computed`, `getCurrentScope`, `onScopeDispose`, `ref`, `unref`, `watchEffect`

The semantic intent appears to be merging all the required imports. Both sides share `getCurrentScope`, `onScopeDispose`, and `ref`. The differences are:
- HEAD has `watchSyncEffect`
- Incoming has `computed`, `unref`, and `watchEffect`

Since these are just imports and both sides likely need their respective functions for the code to work properly, the resolution should include all unique imports from both sides.

```typescript
import {
  computed,
  getCurrentScope,
  onScopeDispose,
  ref,
  unref,
  watchEffect,
  watchSyncEffect,
} from 'vue-demi'
import { useQueryClient } from './useQueryClient'
import type { Ref } from 'vue-demi'
import type { QueryFilters as QF } from '@tanstack/query-core'
import type { MaybeRefDeep } from './types'
import type { QueryClient } from './queryClient'

```
