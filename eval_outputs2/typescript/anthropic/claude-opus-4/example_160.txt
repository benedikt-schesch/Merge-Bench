Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import components and utilities, but with some differences:

- HEAD imports `AddIcon` from `../Icons`
- The other branch imports `Icon` from `'graphcool-styles'` and also imports `Props as TabProps` from the Tab component
- The other branch also imports `withProps` from `../../styled` while HEAD doesn't

Since both sides seem to have valid but different requirements, and without more context about which icons are actually being used in the component, I cannot determine the correct resolution with certainty. The intent is ambiguous - it's unclear whether the component needs `AddIcon`, `Icon`, or both, and whether `withProps` and `TabProps` are actually used.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react'
<<<<<<< HEAD
import { styled } from '../../styled'
import { AddIcon } from '../Icons'
import Tab from './Tab'
=======
import { styled, withProps } from '../../styled'
import { Icon } from 'graphcool-styles'
import Tab, { Props as TabProps } from './Tab'
