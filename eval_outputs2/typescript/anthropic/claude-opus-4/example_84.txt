Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are incrementing the version number of the persisted reducer configuration. The HEAD branch has version 102, while the incoming branch has version 103. Since version numbers should increment sequentially and the incoming branch has the higher version, it likely represents the more recent change that should be kept.

```typescript

const persistedReducer = persistReducer(
  {
    key: 'cherry-studio',
    storage,
    version: 103,
    blacklist: ['runtime', 'messages', 'messageBlocks'],
    migrate
  },
  rootReducer
)

```
