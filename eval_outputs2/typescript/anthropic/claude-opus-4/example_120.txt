Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import from `@univerjs/core`, but with different sets of imports:

- HEAD: imports `ICommandService` and `isRealNum`
- The other branch: imports `ICommandService`, `IKeyValue`, `Tools`, and `isRealNum`

Since both sides include `ICommandService` and `isRealNum`, and the other branch is adding additional imports (`IKeyValue` and `Tools`), the semantic intent appears to be combining all the imports that are needed by the code.

Here's the resolved version:

```typescript
import { Component, ComponentChild, createRef } from 'preact';
import { Subscription } from 'rxjs';
import { ICommandService, IKeyValue, Tools, isRealNum } from '@univerjs/core';
import { BaseMenuProps, BaseMenuState, BaseMenuItem, BaseMenuStyle } from '../../Interfaces';
import { joinClassNames } from '../../Utils';
import { CustomLabel } from '../CustomLabel';

import styles from './index.module.less';

```
