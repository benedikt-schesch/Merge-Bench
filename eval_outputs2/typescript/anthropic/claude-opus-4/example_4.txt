Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import functions from the `./utils` module, but they have different sets of imports:

- HEAD side: imports `cloneDeepUnref`, `shouldThrowError`, `updateState`
- Other side: imports `cloneDeepUnref`, `isQueryKey`, `shouldThrowError`, `updateState`

The semantic intent appears to be that both sides need these utility functions, and the other side has added an additional import (`isQueryKey`). The resolution should include all unique imports from both sides.

```typescript
  readonly,
  toRefs,
  watch,
} from 'vue-demi'
import { useQueryClient } from './useQueryClient'
import {
  cloneDeepUnref,
  isQueryKey,
  shouldThrowError,
  updateState,
} from './utils'
import type { ToRefs } from 'vue-demi'
import type {
  DefaultedQueryObserverOptions,
  QueryKey,
  QueryObserver,

```
