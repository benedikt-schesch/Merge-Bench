Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - creating a mock function for testing. The only difference is the testing framework being used:

- HEAD is using `vi.fn()` (Vitest)
- The incoming change is using `jest.fn()` (Jest)

Since the conflict appears to be about which testing framework to use rather than different functionality, I cannot determine which one should be chosen without knowing the project's testing framework preference. Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```typescript
      }),
    )
  })

  test('should be `enabled` to accept getter function', async () => {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const fetchFn = vi.fn()
=======
    const fetchFn = jest.fn()
>>>>>>> 3a6ffb360b4a7431a1668ae23d47216f9a8efb68
    const checked = ref(false)

    useQuery({
      queryKey: ['enabled'],
      queryFn: fetchFn,

```
