Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different imports to the type import statement. The HEAD branch wants to add `MaybeRefDeep`, while the other branch wants to add `VueQueryObserverOptions` and `WithQueryClientKey`. Since these are non-conflicting additions (they're just different types being imported), the semantic intent is to include all of them.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
import type { UseBaseQueryReturnType } from './useBaseQuery'
import type {
  DeepUnwrapRef,
  DistributiveOmit,
  MaybeRef,
  MaybeRefDeep,
  VueQueryObserverOptions,
  WithQueryClientKey,
} from './types'
import type { QueryClient } from './queryClient'

export type UseQueryOptions<
  TQueryFnData = unknown,

```
