Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Wants to keep the method signature as is and proceed directly to the `updateOne` operation
- Incoming change (e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce): Adds a call to `this.googleClient.getMe()` before the update operation

Without more context about why `getMe()` was added and whether the `me` variable is used later in the method, I cannot determine if this call is necessary or what the semantic intent is. The variable `me` is assigned but I can't see if it's used in the subsequent code.

Since the intent is ambiguous without seeing how `me` is used (if at all) in the rest of the method, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
      workspace: this.user.workspace
    })
  }

  private async setCalendarHistoryId (historyId: string): Promise<void> {
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    const me = await this.googleClient.getMe()
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
    await this.calendarHistories.updateOne(
      {
        userId: this.user.userId,
        workspace: this.user.workspace
      },
```
