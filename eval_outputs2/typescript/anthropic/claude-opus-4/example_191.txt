Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Wants to throw an Error when the Google client operation fails, with a descriptive error message including workspace, userId, and event._id
- **Incoming change**: Wants to log the error to console.error with the same descriptive message, but not throw

The semantic intent appears to be different error handling strategies:
- HEAD wants to propagate the error up (fail-fast approach)
- Incoming wants to log and continue (fail-soft approach)

Since both approaches have valid use cases and the intent is fundamentally different (throw vs log), I cannot definitively resolve this without more context about the desired error handling strategy for this application.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
          })
        }
      }
    } catch (err: any) {
      await this.googleClient.checkError(err)
<<<<<<< HEAD
      // eslint-disable-next-line
      throw new Error(`Create event error, ${this.user.workspace}, ${this.user.userId}, ${event._id}, ${err?.message}`)
=======
      console.error(`Create event error, ${this.user.workspace}, ${this.user.userId}, ${event._id}, ${err?.message}`)
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
    }
  }

  async updateEvent (event: Event): Promise<void> {
    const me = await this.googleClient.getMe()

```
