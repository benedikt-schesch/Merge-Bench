Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import from '../utils', but with some differences:

- HEAD imports: `computeBase`, `countTrailingZeros`, `equal`, `maximum`
- The other branch imports: `countTrailingZeros`, `equal`, `maximum` (same as HEAD minus `computeBase`)
- The other branch also adds type imports: `Calculator`, `Dinero` from '../types'

Since both sides want the type imports and most of the same utility imports, the semantic intent appears to be:
1. Import the necessary types from '../types'
2. Import all the utilities that either side needs from '../utils'

Here's the resolved version:

```typescript
import type { Calculator, Dinero } from '../types';
import { computeBase, countTrailingZeros, equal, maximum } from '../utils';

import { transformScale } from './transformScale';

export type TrimScaleParams<TAmount> = readonly [dineroObject: Dinero<TAmount>];
