Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that HEAD is adding an additional validation rule to check for illegal characters in the zone name (using a regex pattern), while the other branch is simply closing the previous validation chain.

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to validate the zone name
- HEAD wants to add stricter validation by ensuring only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens are allowed
- The other branch doesn't have this additional validation

Since HEAD's additional validation provides more robust input checking without conflicting with the existing "no period" rule, the proper resolution is to keep HEAD's version:

```typescript
          return !value.includes(".");
        },
        {
          message: "Zone name must not contain a period.",
        },
      )
      .refine((value: string) => /^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/.test(value), {
        message: "Zone name has an illegal character.",
      }),
    inertia: z.coerce
      .number()
      .min(1, {
        message: "Inertia must be above 0.",
      })

```
