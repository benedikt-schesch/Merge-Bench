Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add support for different languages:
- HEAD is adding Dutch (nl) language support
- The incoming change is adding Polish (pl) language support

Both changes are valid and non-conflicting in terms of functionality - they're simply adding different language options to what appears to be a switch statement for loading language-specific message modules.

The semantic intent of both sides is to expand language support, so the resolution should include both languages:

```typescript
    }
    case AppLanguage.ko: {
      mod = await import(`./locales/ko/messages`)
      break
    }
    case AppLanguage.nl: {
      mod = await import(`./locales/nl/messages`)
      break
    }
    case AppLanguage.pl: {
      mod = await import(`./locales/pl/messages`)
      break
    }
    case AppLanguage.pt_BR: {
      mod = await import(`./locales/pt-BR/messages`)
      break

```
