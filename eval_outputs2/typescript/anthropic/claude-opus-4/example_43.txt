Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD side is trying to import `currentUser as queryCurrentUser` from a relative path `'./services/ant-design-pro/api'`
2. The incoming change (100a96a) is trying to add an import for `'@ant-design/v5-patch-for-react-19'`
3. There's already an import of `currentUser as queryCurrentUser` from `'@/services/ant-design-pro/api'` earlier in the file

The conflict appears to be that HEAD is trying to add a duplicate import that already exists (just with a different path - relative vs absolute). The incoming change is trying to add a completely different import for an Ant Design patch.

Since the `queryCurrentUser` import already exists with the absolute path, we should keep the incoming change that adds the v5 patch import and discard the duplicate import from HEAD.

```typescript
  SelectLang,
} from '@/components';
import { currentUser as queryCurrentUser } from '@/services/ant-design-pro/api';
import defaultSettings from '../config/defaultSettings';
import { errorConfig } from './requestErrorConfig';
import '@ant-design/v5-patch-for-react-19';

const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
const loginPath = '/user/login';
