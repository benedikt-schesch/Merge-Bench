Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the `HEAD` branch has removed a line that sets `this.stayAlive = stayAlive`, while the incoming branch (e0ec8d4) wants to keep it.

Given that:
1. The constructor parameter `stayAlive: boolean = false` is still present in both versions
2. The incoming branch explicitly sets `this.stayAlive = stayAlive` to store the parameter value
3. The HEAD branch removed this assignment but kept the parameter

The most likely intent is that the HEAD branch may have refactored to handle `stayAlive` differently (perhaps through parent class or other mechanism), but without seeing the full class context, the safer semantic resolution is to keep the assignment since the parameter is still being accepted.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
    private readonly mongo: Db,
    client: Client,
    private readonly workspace: WorkspaceClient,
    stayAlive: boolean = false
  ) {
    this.stayAlive = stayAlive
    this.client = new TxOperations(client, this.user.userId)
    this.systemTxOp = new TxOperations(client, core.account.System)
    this.googleClient = new GoogleClient(user, mongo, this)
    this.calendar = this.googleClient.calendar
    this.histories = mongo.collection<EventHistory>('histories')
```
