Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version includes `MenuPosition` in the imports from `@univerjs/base-ui`, while the other branch doesn't have it. Since both sides are trying to import from the same module and the only difference is the inclusion of `MenuPosition`, I'll resolve this by keeping all imports including `MenuPosition` to ensure nothing breaks.

```typescript
import { BaseMenuItem, BaseSheetBarProps, Button, CustomLabel, IDisplayMenuItem, IMenuItem, Icon, Menu, MenuPosition } from '@univerjs/base-ui';
import { RefObject, Component, createRef } from 'preact';
import { SheetBarMenu, ISheetBarMenuItem } from './SheetBarMenu';
import styles from './index.module.less';
import { SlideTabBar } from '../../Basics/SlideTabBar/SlideTabBar';
