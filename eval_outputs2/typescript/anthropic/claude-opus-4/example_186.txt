Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Wants to keep the function as it was, directly creating a timer
- Incoming change: Wants to add a call to get the current user (`getMe()`) before setting up the timer

Without more context about why `getMe()` was added in the incoming change, and since it's assigned to `me` but `me` doesn't appear to be used in the visible code, I cannot determine the semantic intent clearly enough to resolve this conflict.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
      await this.dummyWatch(calendarId)
    }
  }

  private async dummyWatch (calendarId: string): Promise<void> {
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    const me = await this.googleClient.getMe()
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
    const timer = setTimeout(
      () => {
        void this.sync(calendarId)
      },
      6 * 60 * 60 * 1000
```
