Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define an interface for options, but with different names and slightly different properties.

The HEAD side has:
- Interface named `Options`
- Properties: `cwd`, `build` (plus the common ones below)

The incoming side has:
- Interface named `CreateOptions`
- Properties: `dir`, `scope` (plus the common ones below)

Both sides share common properties: `pretty`, `transpileOnly`, `logError`, `files`, `compiler`

Based on the semantic intent, it appears:
- `cwd` and `dir` likely serve the same purpose (specifying a directory)
- `build` and `scope` seem to be different features being added by each branch
- The interface name `CreateOptions` is more descriptive than just `Options`

Here's the resolved version that combines both intents:

```typescript
export const VERSION = require('../package.json').version

/**
 * Options for creating a new TypeScript compiler instance.
 */
export interface CreateOptions {
  dir?: string
  cwd?: string | null
  scope?: boolean | null
  build?: boolean | null
  pretty?: boolean | null
  transpileOnly?: boolean | null
  logError?: boolean | null
  files?: boolean | null
  compiler?: string
```
