Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to destructure properties from `useSettingStore()`. The HEAD version extracts `sync`, `apiKey`, and `markDescGen`, while the incoming change adds two additional properties: `githubUsername` and `repositoryName`.

The intent appears to be extending the destructured properties to include the GitHub-related settings. This is a typical additive change where new functionality (likely GitHub integration) is being added to the settings.

Here's the resolved version:

```typescript

export function ControlImage() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  const { currentTagId, fetchTags, getCurrentTag } = useTagStore()
  const { sync, apiKey, markDescGen, githubUsername, repositoryName } = useSettingStore()
  const { fetchMarks, addQueue, setQueue, removeQueue } = useMarkStore()

  async function selectImage(event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    const file = event.target.files?.[0]
    if (!file) return

```
