Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - they're both setting up a dependent query with a mock function. The only difference is:

- HEAD uses `vi.fn()` (Vitest)
- The incoming change uses `jest.fn()` (Jest) and has already included the query key in the `useQuery` call

Since the incoming change has a more complete implementation (it includes the query key as the first argument to `useQuery`), and the test framework choice (Jest vs Vitest) appears to be the main difference, I'll resolve this by keeping the structure from the incoming change but using the test framework from HEAD (Vitest):

```typescript
      queryFn: simpleFetcher,
    })

    const enabled = computed(() => !!data.value)

    const dependentQueryFn = vi.fn().mockImplementation(simpleFetcher)
    const { fetchStatus, status } = useQuery(
      ['dependant2'],
      dependentQueryFn,
      reactive({
        queryKey: ['dependant2'],
        queryFn: dependentQueryFn,
        enabled,
      }),

```
