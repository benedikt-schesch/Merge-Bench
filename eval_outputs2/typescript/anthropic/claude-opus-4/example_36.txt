Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the type of the `activeDate` property in an abstract class for a calendar/datepicker component.

- HEAD wants: `activeDate: D`
- The incoming change wants: `activeDate: D | null`

Given the context of a datepicker component and looking at the pattern established by other properties in the class (`minDate` and `maxDate` are both typed as `D | null`), it makes semantic sense that `activeDate` should also be nullable. This would allow the component to handle cases where no date is initially selected or when the date needs to be cleared.

The intent appears to be making the component more flexible by allowing `activeDate` to be null, which aligns with the nullable pattern used for other date properties in the class.

```typescript
 * contains all necessary parts needed for a generic datepicker component.
 */
export abstract class CalendarView<D> implements OnDestroy {

  /** The date representing when to start the calendar. */
  abstract activeDate: D | null;

  /** The minimum selectable date. */
  abstract minDate: D | null;

  /** The maximum selectable date. */

```
