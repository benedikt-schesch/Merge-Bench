Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to set up a test for keyboard navigation, but they're testing different components:

- HEAD is testing `CompositeShift`
- The incoming change is testing `AngularComposite`

Both sides want to use similar testing utilities and perform keyboard navigation tests. The key differences are:
1. Different import paths and component names
2. HEAD uses `getByText: text` destructuring while the incoming change uses `screen.getByText`
3. Different test descriptions

Since these appear to be tests for different components in different files (based on the file paths), this seems like a conflict that arose from moving/renaming files. The semantic intent of both sides is to test keyboard navigation on their respective components.

Given that the file path in the incoming change (`AngularComposite`) seems to be what this test file is actually for, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```typescript
import * as React from "react";
import { render, screen, press, axe } from "reakit-test-utils";
import AngularComposite from "..";

test("navigate through angular composite", () => {
  render(<AngularComposite />);
  press.Tab();
  expect(screen.getByText("item-1-1")).toHaveFocus();
  press.ArrowRight();
  expect(screen.getByText("item-1-2")).toHaveFocus();
  press.ArrowRight();

```
