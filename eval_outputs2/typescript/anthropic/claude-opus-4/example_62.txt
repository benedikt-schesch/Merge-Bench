Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add a new language code to what appears to be an enum or object definition. The HEAD branch is adding Dutch (`nl = 'nl'`) while the other branch is adding Polish (`pl = 'pl'`).

Since both additions are valid and non-conflicting language codes that should coexist, the semantic intent of both sides is to expand the list of supported languages. The resolution should include both languages in alphabetical order.

```typescript
  hu = 'hu',
  id = 'id',
  it = 'it',
  ja = 'ja',
  ko = 'ko',
  nl = 'nl',
  pl = 'pl',
  pt_BR = 'pt-BR',
  ru = 'ru',
  th = 'th',
  tr = 'tr',
  uk = 'uk',

```
