Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add a language import to what appears to be a list of language/locale codes. The HEAD branch is adding `nl` (Dutch) while the other branch is adding `pl` (Polish). 

Since both additions are valid and serve the same purpose (adding language support), and they don't conflict with each other semantically, the resolution should include both languages in alphabetical order.

```typescript
  hu,
  id,
  it,
  ja,
  ko,
  nl,
  pl,
  ptBR,
  ru,
  th,
  tr,
  uk,

```
