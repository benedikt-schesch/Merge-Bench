Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import from `@/types/timeline`, but they're importing different things:

- HEAD is importing just `TimeRange`
- The incoming branch is importing `TimelineScrubMode` and `TimeRange`, plus additional imports from other modules

Since the incoming branch includes everything that HEAD wants (`TimeRange`) plus more, and also adds other necessary imports for what appears to be new functionality (slider component and preview constants), the semantic intent is to keep all the imports from the incoming branch.

```typescript
import { useSwipeable } from "react-swipeable";
import { Tooltip, TooltipContent, TooltipTrigger } from "../ui/tooltip";
import ImageLoadingIndicator from "../indicators/ImageLoadingIndicator";
import useContextMenu from "@/hooks/use-contextmenu";
import ActivityIndicator from "../indicators/activity-indicator";
import { TimelineScrubMode, TimeRange } from "@/types/timeline";
import { NoThumbSlider } from "../ui/slider";
import { PREVIEW_FPS, PREVIEW_PADDING } from "@/types/preview";
import { capitalizeFirstLetter } from "@/utils/stringUtil";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
import { InProgressPreview, VideoPreview } from "../preview/ScrubbablePreview";
import { Preview } from "@/types/preview";
import { baseUrl } from "@/api/baseUrl";

```
