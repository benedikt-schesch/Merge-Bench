Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the `select` method:

- HEAD version: Adds a local variable `oldValue` to store the previous value of `this._selected`
- Incoming version: Adds a period to the JSDoc comment and calls two new methods (`_selectInInput` and `_selectInView`) before setting `this._selected`

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. HEAD wants to preserve the old value (likely for comparison or event emission)
2. The incoming changes want to separate the selection logic into input and view components

Both changes are complementary and can be merged together. The resolved version should:
- Keep the improved JSDoc comment with the period
- Preserve the `oldValue` variable from HEAD
- Include the method calls from the incoming changes

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this._inputSubscription.unsubscribe();
    this._disabledChange.complete();
  }

  /** Selects the given date. */
  select(date: D): void {
    let oldValue = this._selected;
    this._selectInInput(date);
    this._selectInView(date);
    this._selected = date;
  }

  /** Selects the given date from view in input. */
  private _selectInInput(date: D): void {

```
