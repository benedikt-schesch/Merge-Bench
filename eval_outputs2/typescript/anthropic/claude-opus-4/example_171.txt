Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to check if a user is the system account, but they're using different identifiers:

- HEAD is using `systemAccountUuid` (a UUID-based identifier)
- The incoming change is using `systemAccountEmail` (an email-based identifier)

Without more context about which identifier is the correct one to use in the current codebase, or whether there's been a refactoring from email-based to UUID-based identification (or vice versa), I cannot determine the correct resolution.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
      if (this.ticks % (60 * ticksPerSecond) === workspace.tickHash) {
        try {
          // update account lastVisit every minute per every workspace.‚àè
          let connected: boolean = false
          for (const val of workspace.sessions.values()) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            if (val.session.getUser() !== systemAccountUuid) {
=======
            if (val.session.getUser() !== systemAccountEmail) {
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
              connected = true
              break
            }
          }
<<<<<<< HEAD
