Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import necessary dependencies and set up styles for a login page. The conflict appears to be about:

1. The file location/naming convention (`src/pages/user/login/index.tsx` vs `src/pages/User/Login/index.tsx`)
2. Different imports being added by each side

Based on the semantic intent, both sides need their respective imports, and the `createStyles` import is being used in the code that follows. Here's the resolved version:

```typescript
import { FormattedMessage, history, SelectLang, useIntl, useModel, Helmet } from '@umijs/max';
import { Alert, message, Tabs } from 'antd';
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';
import Settings from '../../../../config/defaultSettings';
import { createStyles } from 'antd-style';

const useStyles = createStyles(({ token }) => {
  return {
    action: {
      marginLeft: '8px',

```
