Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD is trying to import `PersonId`, `SocialIdType`, `buildSocialIdString`, and `TxMixin` from the core module
- The other branch (e0ec8d4) appears to have removed these imports

Looking at the context, the surrounding code still has imports from `@hcengineering/contact` and continues with more imports from core (`RateLimiter`, `TxOperations`, etc.). 

Since I cannot determine the semantic intent of why these imports were removed in one branch while being added/kept in another, and without more context about how these imports are used in the code, I cannot safely resolve this conflict.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
  getPersonRefBySocialId,
  getPersonRefsBySocialIds,
  type Employee
} from '@hcengineering/contact'
import core, {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  PersonId,
  SocialIdType,
  buildSocialIdString,
  TxMixin,
=======
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
  RateLimiter,
  TxOperations,
  TxProcessor,
  WorkspaceUuid,
  toIdMap,
```
