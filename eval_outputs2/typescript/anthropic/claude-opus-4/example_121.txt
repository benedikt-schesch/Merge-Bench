Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to set the same initial state with `value: {}`. The only difference is that HEAD has a trailing comma after the object, while the other branch does not.

Since both sides have the exact same semantic intent (initializing `value` to an empty object), and the trailing comma is just a stylistic difference that doesn't affect functionality, I'll resolve this by keeping the version with the trailing comma as it's generally considered good practice in JavaScript/TypeScript for cleaner diffs in the future.

```typescript
    constructor() {
        super();

        this.state = {
            disabled: false,
            value: {},
        };
    }

    mouseEnter = (e: MouseEvent, index: number) => {
        const { menuItem } = this.props;

```
