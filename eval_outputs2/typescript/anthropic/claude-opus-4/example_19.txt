Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve with the `context` property.

- HEAD side: `context: {},` - wants an empty object for context
- The other side: `context: Object.assign({}, extractedFn),` - wants to create a new object with all properties from `extractedFn`

From a semantic perspective, the second approach seems more intentional - it's explicitly copying the `extractedFn` properties into the context. The HEAD side's empty object might have been a placeholder or incomplete implementation.

Since `extractedFn` is already being spread into the middleware parameters (`...extractedFn`), and the other side wants to also pass it as context, this suggests the context should contain the same information as `extractedFn` for the middleware to process.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
          return executeMiddleware(resolvedMiddleware, 'client', {
            ...extractedFn,
            method: resolvedOptions.method,
            data: opts?.data as any,
            headers: opts?.headers,
            context: Object.assign({}, extractedFn),
          }).then((d) => {
            if (d.error) throw d.error
            return d.result
          })
        },
```
