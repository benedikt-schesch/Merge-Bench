Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to check if Ollama endpoint configuration exists, but using different approaches:

- HEAD: Uses `hasValidApiKey(envContent, 'OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT')`
- The other branch: Uses `hasValidOllamaEndpoint(envContent)`

Based on the context and the fact that we're checking for an Ollama endpoint (not an API key), the more semantically correct approach would be to use the dedicated `hasValidOllamaEndpoint` function. This is more specific and better expresses the intent.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
    }
  }

  // Always set up Ollama as universal fallback (if not already configured)
  const envContent = existsSync(envFilePath) ? await fs.readFile(envFilePath, 'utf8') : '';
  if (!hasValidOllamaEndpoint(envContent)) {
    await setupEmbeddingModelConfig('ollama', envFilePath, false);
  }
}
