Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import necessary dependencies, but they're importing different things:

- HEAD side: Imports `resolve` from "path", `IpcEvents` from "shared/IpcEvents", and worker-related imports
- Other side: Imports `Server` from "arrpc" and `IpcCommands` from "shared/IpcEvents"

The intent appears to be that both sides need their respective imports. The key observation is that one side uses `IpcEvents` while the other uses `IpcCommands` from the same module, which suggests they might both be needed or that there was a rename.

Based on the context (the file appears to be related to Discord RPC/arrpc functionality), it seems like we need imports from both sides. Here's the resolved version:

import { resolve } from "path";
import Server from "arrpc";
import { IpcEvents, IpcCommands } from "shared/IpcEvents";
import { MessageChannel, Worker } from "worker_threads";

import { sendRendererCommand } from "./ipcCommands";
import { Settings } from "./settings";
import { ArrpcEvent, ArrpcHostEvent } from "./utils/arrpcWorkerTypes";
