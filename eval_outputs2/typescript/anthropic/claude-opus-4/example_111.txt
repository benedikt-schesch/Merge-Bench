Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import from the same module, but with different approaches:

- HEAD: imports `presence` and `processId` from './MatchMaker.js' (using .js extension)
- The other branch: imports `MatchMakerState`, `presence`, `processId`, and `state` from "./MatchMaker" (no extension, different quotes)

The semantic intent appears to be that the other branch wants to import additional items (`MatchMakerState` and `state`) while also standardizing the import path format (no .js extension, double quotes).

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
import { MatchMakerState, presence, processId, state } from "./MatchMaker";

export type Stats = {
  roomCount: number;
  ccu: number;
}

```
