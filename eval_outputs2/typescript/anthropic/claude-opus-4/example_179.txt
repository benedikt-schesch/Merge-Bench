Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the parameter of the `signout` method:

- HEAD: Uses `personId: PersonId` as the parameter
- The other branch: Uses `value: string` as the parameter

Both versions then use this parameter to look up a client in `this.clients.get()`. Based on the context and the fact that the method is dealing with signing out a person/client, it seems the HEAD version with `personId: PersonId` is more semantically correct and type-safe, as it clearly indicates the parameter represents a person identifier rather than a generic string value.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
    }

    return personId
  }

  async signout (personId: PersonId, byError: boolean = false): Promise<number> {
    let client = this.clients.get(personId)
    if (client !== undefined) {
      if (client instanceof Promise) {
        client = await client
      }
      await client.signout()

```
