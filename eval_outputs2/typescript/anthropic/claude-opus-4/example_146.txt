Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD wants to import `withMockProperties` from '../tests/utils' and both `Agent` and `OpenAgent` from './agent'
- The other branch wants to import `version` from '../package.json' and only `OpenAgent` from './agent'

Since this is in a test file (as evidenced by the `describe` block), and the HEAD branch is importing a test utility (`withMockProperties`), it seems the HEAD version is more appropriate for a test context. The other branch's import of `version` from package.json seems less relevant for a test file.

However, both branches agree on needing `OpenAgent`, so that should definitely be kept. The question is whether `Agent` is also needed (from HEAD) and whether `version` is needed (from the other branch).

Without more context about how these imports are used in the test, I'll preserve the conflict as is:

```typescript
<<<<<<< HEAD
import { withMockProperties } from '../tests/utils'
import { Agent, OpenAgent } from './agent'
=======
import { version } from '../package.json'
import { OpenAgent } from './agent'
>>>>>>> 9c546ed26b7a224d033269b4e120a97ce38dfaa9
import { sources } from './sources'
import { resetScreenFrameWatch } from './sources/screen_frame'

describe('Agent', () => {
  it('collects all components without unexpected errors and makes visitorId', async () => {

```
