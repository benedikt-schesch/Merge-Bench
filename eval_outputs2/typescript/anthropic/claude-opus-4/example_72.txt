Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD wants version `10.1.1`
- The incoming branch wants version `12.0.0`

This appears to be a version bump conflict where both branches have independently updated the version number. The incoming branch has a significantly higher version (12.0.0 vs 10.1.1), suggesting it likely represents a newer or more substantial update.

In semantic versioning:
- 10.1.1 suggests a patch release from 10.1.0
- 12.0.0 suggests a major version bump with potentially breaking changes

Since the incoming branch has the higher major version (12.0.0), it likely represents the more recent/correct version that should be kept.

```typescript
export default new IntegrationDefinition({
  name: 'openai',
  title: 'OpenAI',
  description:
    'Gain access to OpenAI models for text generation, speech synthesis, audio transcription, and image generation.',
  version: '12.0.0',
  readme: 'hub.md',
  icon: 'icon.svg',
  entities: {
    modelRef: {
      schema: z.object({
