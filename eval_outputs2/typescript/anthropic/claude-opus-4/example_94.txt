Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are testing the same functionality - unsubscribing a non-existing callback and verifying that the original subscription still works. The key difference is:

- HEAD version uses `await` with async operations
- The other branch removes `await`, treating operations as synchronous

Given the test name includes "async" and uses `await timeout(10)` at the end, it appears the intent is to test asynchronous behavior. The HEAD version with `await` is more consistent with async testing patterns and ensures operations complete before assertions.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
        assert.ok(true);
      });

      it("unsubscribe from non-existing callback", async () => {
        let callCount = 0;
        await presence.subscribe("topic", (_) => { callCount++; });
        await presence.unsubscribe("topic", function() {});
        await presence.publish("topic", "hello world!");
        await timeout(10);
        assert.strictEqual(1, callCount);
      });
