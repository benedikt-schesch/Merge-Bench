Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has added a case for "base-goerlia" (with a typo) that includes a TODO comment to remove it in the future. The other branch doesn't have this case at all.

The intent appears to be:
- HEAD wanted to maintain backward compatibility with the typo "base-goerlia" while also having the correct "base-goerli"
- The other branch only has the correct spelling "base-goerli"

Since the HEAD branch explicitly indicates this is a typo that should be removed in the future, and both branches have the correct "base-goerli" case, the semantic intent is to support both spellings temporarily. This is a common pattern for maintaining backward compatibility during a transition period.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
            return "arbitrum-goerli.infura.io";
        case "arbitrum-sepolia":
            return "arbitrum-sepolia.infura.io";
        case "base":
            return "base-mainnet.infura.io";
        case "base-goerlia": // @TODO: Remove this typo in the future!
        case "base-goerli":
            return "base-goerli.infura.io";
        case "base-sepolia":
            return "base-sepolia.infura.io";
        case "bnb":
