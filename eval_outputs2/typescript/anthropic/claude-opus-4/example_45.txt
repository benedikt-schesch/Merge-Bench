Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import the same testing utilities but with slightly different approaches:

- HEAD: Has the imports in a specific order and includes `act` from '@testing-library/react'
- The other branch: Has `// @ts-ignore` at the top and imports `act` from 'react' directly

The semantic intent of both sides is to set up the necessary imports for testing. The key differences are:
1. The placement of the `// @ts-ignore` comment
2. Where `act` is imported from
3. The order of imports

Since both sides want the same testing utilities and the `// @ts-ignore` comment is present in both (just in different positions), I'll merge them by:
- Keeping the `// @ts-ignore` at the top (as in the incoming branch)
- Including all necessary imports
- Using `act` from '@testing-library/react' (which is the more common pattern)

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
ï»¿// @ts-ignore
import { startMock } from '@@/requestRecordMock';
import { TestBrowser } from '@@/testBrowser';
import { act, fireEvent, render } from '@testing-library/react';
import React from 'react';


```
