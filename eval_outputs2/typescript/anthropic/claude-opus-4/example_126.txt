Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Destructures `label` and `display` from props
- Incoming change: Destructures `label` and `onChange` from props

Both sides want `label`, but they differ on the second property. Without more context about the component's purpose and the `IBaseCustomLabelProps` interface, I cannot determine which properties should actually be destructured or if perhaps all three properties should be included.

Since the intent is ambiguous without knowing:
1. What properties `IBaseCustomLabelProps` actually contains
2. Whether this is a breaking change where `display` was replaced by `onChange`
3. Or if both properties should coexist

I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unresolved:

```typescript
}

/** @deprecated */
export function CustomLabel(props: IBaseCustomLabelProps): JSX.Element | null {
    const context = useContext(AppContext);
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const { label, display } = props;
=======
    const { label, onChange } = props;
>>>>>>> a5aac53666a8983bb54bba93a196daee2dc4a61c

    function getLocale(name: string) {
        return context.localeService?.t(name);
    }
