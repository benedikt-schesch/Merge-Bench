Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD branch is trying to:
   - Create an `llmClient` from `llmProvider.getClient(modelName, requestId)`
   - Determine if it's using Anthropic by checking `llmClient.type === "anthropic"`
   - Use this `isUsingAnthropic` variable in the prompt building functions

2. The other branch (85483fe) appears to have removed this logic entirely, suggesting that either:
   - The `llmClient` is now passed in as a parameter (which we can see it is in the function signature)
   - The Anthropic-specific logic has been moved elsewhere or is no longer needed

Since the function signature already includes `llmClient: LLMClient` as a parameter, the HEAD's attempt to create a new `llmClient` from `llmProvider` would create a variable name conflict and is likely incorrect. The other branch's approach of using the passed-in `llmClient` directly makes more sense.

However, the `isUsingAnthropic` check might still be needed for the prompt building functions. Let me preserve the Anthropic check while using the passed-in `llmClient`:

```typescript
  llmClient: LLMClient;
  chunksSeen: number;
  chunksTotal: number;
  requestId: string;
}) {
  const isUsingAnthropic = llmClient.type === "anthropic";

  const extractionResponse = await llmClient.createChatCompletion({
    messages: [
      buildExtractSystemPrompt(isUsingAnthropic),
      buildExtractUserPrompt(instruction, domElements, isUsingAnthropic),
    ],
```
