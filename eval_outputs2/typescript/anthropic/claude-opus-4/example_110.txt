Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to handle the case when `_internalState` is `DISPOSING`, but with different approaches:

- HEAD: Calls `_disposeIfEmpty()` for graceful shutdown and returns `Deferred.reject('disconnecting')`
- The other branch: Returns `Promise.reject(new Error("disposing"))` with a @ts-ignore comment

The semantic intent of both sides is to reject when the room is disposing, but they differ in:
1. Whether to perform cleanup (`_disposeIfEmpty()`)
2. The rejection method (`Deferred.reject` vs `Promise.reject`)
3. The error format (string vs Error object)
4. The error message ('disconnecting' vs 'disposing')

Without more context about the codebase conventions and whether `Deferred` is being phased out in favor of native Promises, or whether the graceful shutdown is necessary, I cannot determine the correct resolution.

Here is the same snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
    if (seconds === "manual") {
      seconds = Infinity;
    }

    if (this._internalState === RoomInternalState.DISPOSING) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      this._disposeIfEmpty(); // gracefully shutting down
      return Deferred.reject('disconnecting');
=======
      // @ts-ignore
      return Promise.reject(new Error("disposing"));
>>>>>>> 1a7da98cbeee551587e6119d06a39a441421827b
    }

    const sessionId = previousClient.sessionId;
    const reconnectionToken = previousClient.reconnectionToken;
