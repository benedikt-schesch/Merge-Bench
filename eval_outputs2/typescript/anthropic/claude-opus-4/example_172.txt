Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the `getWorkspaceInfo` method call, but with different parameters:

- HEAD version: `this.getWorkspaceInfo(workspace.token, connected)`
- Incoming version: `this.getWorkspaceInfo(this.ctx, workspace.token, connected)`

The semantic intent appears to be that the incoming change is adding a context parameter (`this.ctx`) as the first argument to the method call, while HEAD has the original signature. This is a common pattern when refactoring code to pass context objects through method calls.

Here's the resolved version that preserves the semantic intent of both changes:

```typescript
              connected = true
              break
            }
          }
          void this.getWorkspaceInfo(this.ctx, workspace.token, connected).catch(() => {
            // Ignore
          })
        } catch (err: any) {
          // Ignore
        }

```
