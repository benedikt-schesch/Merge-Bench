Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import from 'vue-demi', but they have different sets of imports:

- HEAD: imports `onScopeDispose, ref`
- The other branch: imports `onScopeDispose, reactive, ref`

The semantic intent appears to be that the other branch added `reactive` to the existing imports. Since both sides want `onScopeDispose` and `ref`, and the other branch additionally needs `reactive`, the resolution should include all three imports.

```typescript
import { onScopeDispose, reactive, ref } from 'vue-demi'

import { vi } from 'vitest'
import { useQueries } from '../useQueries'
import { useQueryClient } from '../useQueryClient'
import { QueryClient } from '../queryClient'

```
