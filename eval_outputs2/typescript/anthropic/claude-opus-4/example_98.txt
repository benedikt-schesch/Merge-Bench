Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to import types/interfaces from similar modules but with slightly different approaches:

- HEAD imports `Room` from '../Room.js' (with .js extension) and imports `IRoomCache` from './driver/api.js'
- The other branch imports `Room` from '../Room' (without .js extension) and imports `IRoomListingData` from './driver/interfaces'

Since both sides want to import the `Room` type and each side needs its specific interface (`IRoomCache` vs `IRoomListingData`), the semantic intent appears to be that both interfaces are needed. The difference in the .js extension is likely a module resolution preference.

Here's the resolved conflict that preserves both intents:

```typescript
import * as matchMaker from '../MatchMaker.js';

import type { Room } from '../Room.js';
import { IRoomCache } from './driver/api.js';
import { IRoomListingData } from './driver/interfaces';

const LOBBY_CHANNEL = '$lobby';
