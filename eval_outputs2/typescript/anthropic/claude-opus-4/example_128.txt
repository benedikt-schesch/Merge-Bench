Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define a menu item for the same command, but with different approaches:

- HEAD side: Uses a template string `${DeleteRangeCommand.id}up` for the id and `positions` for the menu placement
- Other side: Uses `DeleteRangeMoveUpCommand.id` directly and `menu` for the menu placement

Based on the function name `DeleteRangeMoveUpMenuItemFactory` and the context, it appears the intent is to create a menu item for a "move up" variant of the delete range command. The other side's approach using `DeleteRangeMoveUpCommand.id` seems more semantically correct as it directly references what appears to be a dedicated command for this action.

However, both sides use different property names for menu placement (`positions` vs `menu`). Without knowing the exact API requirements, I'll preserve the conflict as the correct property name is ambiguous:

```typescript
    };
}

export function DeleteRangeMoveUpMenuItemFactory(accessor: IAccessor): IMenuItem {
    return {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        id: `${DeleteRangeCommand.id}up`,
        positions: [MenuPosition.CONTEXT_MENU],
=======
        id: DeleteRangeMoveUpCommand.id,
        menu: [MenuPosition.CONTEXT_MENU],
>>>>>>> a5aac53666a8983bb54bba93a196daee2dc4a61c
        title: 'rightClick.moveUp',
        parentId: DeleteRangeCommand.id,
    };
}
