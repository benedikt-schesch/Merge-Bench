Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different imports from the same module `@hcengineering/analytics`. 

The HEAD branch wants to import `buildSocialIdString`, while the other branch wants to import `Client` and `ClientWorkspaceInfo`. Since these are non-conflicting imports that serve different purposes, the semantic resolution is to include all of them.

```typescript
//

import { Analytics } from '@hcengineering/analytics'
import {
  AccountRole,
  buildSocialIdString,
  Client,
  ClientWorkspaceInfo,
  concatLink,
  Data,
  isActiveMode,
  isWorkspaceCreating,
  MeasureContext,

```
