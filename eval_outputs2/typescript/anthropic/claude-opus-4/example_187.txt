Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is adding imports for `calendar_v3` from 'googleapis' and `GoogleClient` from './googleClient', while the other branch (e0ec8d4) has a cleaner import structure without these additions.

Based on the semantic intent, it appears that:
- The HEAD branch is introducing Google Calendar integration functionality (hence the googleapis and GoogleClient imports)
- The other branch maintains the existing import structure without Google-specific dependencies

Since both sides seem to have valid intentions and the conflict appears to be about whether to include Google Calendar functionality or not, I cannot determine which is the correct resolution without more context about the project's requirements.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:
