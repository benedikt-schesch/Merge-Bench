Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to destructure different variables from hooks:

- HEAD: wants to get `provider` from `useProvider()` and `codeStyle` from `useSettings()`
- The other branch: wants to get `theme` from `useSettings()` and `themeNames` from `useCodeStyle()`

Both sides seem to have valid intentions - one needs provider and codeStyle information, while the other needs theme-related information. Since these don't conflict semantically (they're adding different functionality), the resolution should include all the required variables and hooks.

```typescript
  assistant: Assistant
}

const SettingsTab: FC<Props> = (props) => {
  const { assistant, updateAssistantSettings, updateAssistant } = useAssistant(props.assistant.id)
  const { provider } = useProvider(assistant.model.provider)
  const { messageStyle, codeStyle, fontSize, language, theme } = useSettings()
  const { themeNames } = useCodeStyle()

  const [temperature, setTemperature] = useState(assistant?.settings?.temperature ?? DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE)
  const [contextCount, setContextCount] = useState(assistant?.settings?.contextCount ?? DEFAULT_CONTEXTCOUNT)
  const [enableMaxTokens, setEnableMaxTokens] = useState(assistant?.settings?.enableMaxTokens ?? false)
  const [maxTokens, setMaxTokens] = useState(assistant?.settings?.maxTokens ?? 0)

```
