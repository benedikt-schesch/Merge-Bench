Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Wants to check if `Result[K]` is a function type using `extends (...args: Array<any>) => any`
- **Right side**: Wants to explicitly list specific function names that should be treated specially: 'fetchNextPage', 'fetchPreviousPage', 'refetch', 'remove'

Both sides have the same intent: they want to identify which properties of `Result` are functions and handle them differently from non-function properties. The HEAD version uses a type-based approach (checking if it's a function), while the right side uses a name-based approach (checking specific property names).

The type-based approach from HEAD is more robust and maintainable because:
1. It automatically handles any function properties without needing to maintain a list
2. It's less prone to errors if new function properties are added to the Result type
3. It's more semantically correct - we care about whether something is a function, not its name

Here's the resolved conflict:

```typescript
export type UseBaseQueryReturnType<
  TData,
  TError,
  Result = QueryObserverResult<TData, TError>,
> = {
  [K in keyof Result]: Result[K] extends (...args: Array<any>) => any
    ? Result[K]
    : ToRef<Readonly<Result>[K]>
} & {
  suspense: () => Promise<Result>
}
```
