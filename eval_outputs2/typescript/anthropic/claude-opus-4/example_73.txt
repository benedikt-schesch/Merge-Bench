Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to import some OpenAI-related types (`ChatCompletion` and `ChatCompletionToolChoiceOption`), while the other branch appears to have removed or not included these imports.

Without more context about the intent of both branches, I cannot determine whether these OpenAI imports should be kept or removed. The conflict might represent:
1. HEAD adding OpenAI support while the other branch doesn't need it
2. The other branch intentionally removing OpenAI dependencies
3. A refactoring where these imports were moved elsewhere

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
<<<<<<< HEAD
import {
  ChatCompletion,
  ChatCompletionToolChoiceOption,
} from "openai/resources";
=======
>>>>>>> 5afa0b940a9f379a3719a5bbae249dd2a9ef8380
import { ZodType } from "zod";
import {
  AnthropicTransformedResponse,
  AvailableModel,
<<<<<<< HEAD
```
