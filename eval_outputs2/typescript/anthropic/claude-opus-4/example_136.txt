Looking at this merge conflict, I can see two different approaches being taken:

- **HEAD**: Initializes a new npm/yarn/pnpm project using the package manager's init command
- **Incoming change**: Clones the Electron Quick Start repository from GitHub

Based on the context of this being an 'import' test that checks if it "creates forge.config.js and is packageable", both approaches seem to be trying to set up a test directory with a project. However, they're taking fundamentally different approaches:

1. The HEAD version creates a minimal package.json file
2. The incoming version sets up a complete Electron Quick Start project

Without more context about what the test is trying to achieve (whether it needs a minimal setup or a full Electron project), I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The intent is ambiguous.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript

    describe('import', () => {
      before(async () => {
        dir = await ensureTestDirIsNonexistent();
        await fs.mkdir(dir);
<<<<<<< HEAD
        execSync(nodeInstaller === 'pnpm' ? `${nodeInstaller} init` : `${nodeInstaller} init -y`, {
=======
        execSync(`git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start.git . --quiet`, {
>>>>>>> 84eb77568a89330999dafb531a9ed7e003870165
          cwd: dir,
        });
      });

      it('creates forge.config.js and is packageable', async () => {

```
