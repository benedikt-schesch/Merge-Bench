Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD is trying to import `AdapterDebugLogs` from "../adapters"
- The incoming change is trying to import `Database as BunDatabase` from "bun:sqlite" with a ts-ignore comment

Both imports serve different purposes and don't conflict with each other semantically. They should both be included to preserve the intent of both sides of the merge.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
import type { CookieOptions } from "better-call";
import type { Database } from "better-sqlite3";
import type { Logger } from "../utils";
import type { AuthMiddleware } from "../plugins";
import type { LiteralUnion, OmitId } from "./helper";
import type { AdapterDebugLogs } from "../adapters";
//@ts-ignore - we need to import this to get the type of the database
import type { Database as BunDatabase } from "bun:sqlite";

export type BetterAuthOptions = {
	/**
	 * The name of the application
	 *

```
