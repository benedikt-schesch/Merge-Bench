Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are importing the same two items (`EventEmitter` and `OnDestroy`) from `@angular/core`, just in different orders. Since the semantic intent is identical (importing these two Angular core components), I'll resolve this by keeping one version.

```typescript

import {EventEmitter, OnDestroy} from '@angular/core';

/**
 * An abstract calendar that is used as part of the datepicker. This abstract calendar class
 * contains all necessary parts needed for a generic datepicker component.
 */

```
