Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- The HEAD side appears to end after the warning check
- The incoming change (3d6408484) adds code that creates a computed `options` variable using `parseQueryArgs`

Both changes seem to be additive and non-conflicting in terms of intent. The HEAD side completes the warning logic, while the incoming side adds new functionality for parsing query arguments. These changes should both be kept.

```typescript
      console.warn(
        'vue-query composables like "uesQuery()" should only be used inside a "setup()" function or a running effect scope. They might otherwise lead to memory leaks.',
      )
    }
  }

  const options = computed(() => parseQueryArgs(arg1, arg2, arg3))

  const client = queryClient || useQueryClient()

  const defaultedOptions = computed(() => {
    const defaulted: DefaultedQueryObserverOptions<

```
