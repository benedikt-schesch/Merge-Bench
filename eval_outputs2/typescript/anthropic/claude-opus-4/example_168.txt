Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: The `sessionFactory` function takes 3 parameters: `token`, `workspace`, and `account`, and passes all three plus `true` to `new ClientSession()`
- **Incoming changes**: The `sessionFactory` function takes only 2 parameters: `token` and `workspace`, and passes both plus `true` to `new ClientSession()`

The conflict appears to be about whether the `ClientSession` constructor should receive an `account` parameter or not. The incoming changes suggest that the `account` parameter was removed from the `ClientSession` constructor signature.

Since the incoming changes show a deliberate removal of the `account` parameter (both from the function parameters and the constructor call), this appears to be an intentional API change. The semantic intent seems to be simplifying the `ClientSession` initialization by removing the account parameter.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
            return { docs: [] }
          },
          loadModel: async (ctx, lastModelTx, hash) => []
        }
      },
      sessionFactory: (token, workspace) => new ClientSession(token, workspace, true),
      port: port + 1,
      brandingMap: {},
      serverFactory: startHttpServer,
      accountsUrl: '',
      externalStorage: createDummyStorageAdapter()
```
