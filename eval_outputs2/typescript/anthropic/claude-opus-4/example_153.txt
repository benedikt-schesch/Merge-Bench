Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different optional properties to the `IndexOptions` type:

- HEAD wants to add `urls?: string[]` - likely for specifying multiple URLs to index
- The incoming branch wants to add a `quota` object with rate limiting configuration

These changes appear to be complementary rather than conflicting - they're adding different functionality to the same type. The semantic intent is to extend the options available for indexing operations.

Here's the resolved version that includes both additions:

```typescript

export type IndexOptions = {
  client_email?: string;
  private_key?: string;
  path?: string;
  urls?: string[];
  quota?: {
    rpmRetry?: boolean; // read requests per minute: retry after waiting time
  };
};

/**
 * Indexes the specified domain or site URL.
 * @param input - The domain or site URL to index.

```
