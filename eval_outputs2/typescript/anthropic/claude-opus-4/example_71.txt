Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the version number of the integration definition. The HEAD branch has version '4.0.1' while the other branch has version '5.0.0'. 

Since version '5.0.0' represents a major version bump (from 4.x to 5.x), which typically indicates breaking changes or significant updates, while '4.0.1' is just a patch version, the semantically correct resolution would be to use the higher version number '5.0.0'.

```typescript
export default new IntegrationDefinition({
  name: 'fireworks-ai',
  title: 'Fireworks AI',
  description:
    'Choose from curated Fireworks AI models for content generation, chat completions, and audio transcription.',
  version: '5.0.0',
  readme: 'hub.md',
  icon: 'icon.svg',
  entities: {
    modelRef: {
      schema: z.object({

```
