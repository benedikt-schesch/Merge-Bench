Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add a new language to what appears to be a language list. The HEAD branch is adding Dutch (nl), while the other branch is adding Polish (pl). 

Since both additions are valid and non-conflicting (they're just adding different languages to the same list), the semantic intent of both changes should be preserved by including both languages in the final result.

```typescript
  {code2: AppLanguage.hu, name: 'magyar – Hungarian'},
  {code2: AppLanguage.id, name: 'Bahasa Indonesia – Indonesian'},
  {code2: AppLanguage.it, name: 'Italiano – Italian'},
  {code2: AppLanguage.ja, name: '日本語 – Japanese'},
  {code2: AppLanguage.ko, name: '한국어 – Korean'},
  {code2: AppLanguage.nl, name: 'Nederlands – Dutch'},
  {code2: AppLanguage.pl, name: 'Polski – Polish'},
  {code2: AppLanguage.pt_BR, name: 'Português (BR) – Portuguese (BR)'},
  {code2: AppLanguage.ru, name: 'Русский – Russian'},
  {code2: AppLanguage.th, name: 'ภาษาไทย – Thai'},
  {code2: AppLanguage.tr, name: 'Türkçe – Turkish'},
  {code2: AppLanguage.uk, name: 'Українська – Ukrainian'},
