Looking at this merge conflict, I can see two sides trying to work with breakpoint-related functionality:

- **HEAD**: Imports `keysOf` utility and `breakpoint as breakpoints` from specific paths
- **Other branch**: Imports a `getBreakpoint` function

Both sides appear to be working on breakpoint-related functionality but taking different approaches. Without more context about the actual usage of these imports in the code below, and given that the comment mentions this is related to Jest test mocking for `CurrentEuiBreakpoint` logic, I cannot definitively determine which imports are actually needed or if both might be required.

Since the intent is ambiguous without seeing how these imports are used in the actual implementation, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
 * Side Public License, v 1.
 */

import { useContext } from 'react';

<<<<<<< HEAD
import { keysOf } from '../../components/common';
import { breakpoint as breakpoints } from '../../themes/amsterdam/global_styling/variables/_breakpoint';
=======
import { getBreakpoint } from './breakpoint';
>>>>>>> 1fe4245ac533bf4fa8cf7ca7ec0b256ba5c2f1b4
import { CurrentEuiBreakpointContext } from './current_breakpoint';

/**
 * Jest tests *likely* will not have a wrapping EuiProvider. If they don't,
 * this test mock mimics CurrentEuiBreakpoint logic (w/o resize observers).
```
