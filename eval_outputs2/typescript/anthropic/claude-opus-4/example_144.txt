Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version number conflict in what appears to be an auto-generated file (based on the comment about not modifying it manually).

The conflict shows:
- HEAD (current branch): version 6.7.0
- Incoming change: version 6.6.7

Since 6.7.0 is a higher version than 6.6.7, and this appears to be an auto-generated version file, the semantically correct resolution would typically be to keep the higher version number. This follows standard semantic versioning where 6.7.0 > 6.6.7.

```typescript
/* Do NOT modify this file; see /src.ts/_admin/update-version.ts */

/**
 *  The current version of Ethers.
 */
export const version: string = "6.7.0";

```
