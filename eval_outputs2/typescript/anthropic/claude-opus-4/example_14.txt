Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import from `@testing-library/react`, but with different sets of functions:

- HEAD: imports `render` and `waitFor`
- Incoming change: imports `fireEvent`, `render`, and `waitFor`

Additionally, HEAD includes an import from `vitest` (`vi`), while the incoming change doesn't have this import.

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides need `render` and `waitFor` from `@testing-library/react`
- The incoming change also needs `fireEvent`
- HEAD needs `vi` from `vitest`

The resolution should include all the required imports from both sides:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react'
import { fireEvent, render, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react'
import { vi } from 'vitest'

import { QueryClient, useQueries, useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { persistQueryClientSave } from '@tanstack/query-persist-client-core'

import { PersistQueryClientProvider } from '../PersistQueryClientProvider'

```
