Looking at this merge conflict, both sides appear to be adding test cases to what seems to be a test suite for a datepicker component. The conflict shows:

- HEAD (current branch): Has an empty section after the previous `describe` block
- Incoming changes: Adds a new `describe` block testing behavior when DateAdapter and CDK_DATE_FORMATS are missing

Both changes should be kept as they represent different test scenarios. The incoming change adds valuable test coverage for error handling when required dependencies are missing.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript

    });

  });

  describe('with missing DateAdapter and CDK_DATE_FORMATS', () => {
    it('should throw when created', () => {
      expect(() => createComponent(StandardDatepicker))
          .toThrowError(/CdkDatepicker: No provider found for .*/);
    });
  });

  describe('popup positioning', () => {
    let fixture: ComponentFixture<StandardDatepicker>;
    let testComponent: StandardDatepicker;
    let input: HTMLElement;


```
