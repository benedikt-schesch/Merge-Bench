Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- The HEAD branch has added three imports: `ChevronUp`, `X`, and `Hash`
- The incoming branch (443e8e157a131812ace7fbbb3408c584e94d2b82) has added only `X`

Since both sides want to import `X`, and the HEAD branch has additional imports that don't conflict with the incoming changes, the semantic intent appears to be to include all the imports. Here's the resolved version:

```typescript
  Copy,
  ChevronDown,
  GitBranch,
  Settings,
  Globe,
  ChevronUp,
  X,
  Hash
} from "lucide-react";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label";
import { Popover } from "@/components/ui/popover";
```
