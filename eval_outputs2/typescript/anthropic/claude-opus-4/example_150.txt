Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle a conditional check for `optionsOrPlugin`, but with different approaches:

- HEAD is checking `if (!isPlugin(optionsOrPlugin))` and wants to apply `defaultStyleReset` to the element's style
- The incoming branch is checking `if (typeof optionsOrPlugin !== "function")` and proceeds directly to the animation

Both conditions appear to be checking whether `optionsOrPlugin` is not a function/plugin. The semantic intent is the same - to handle the case when `optionsOrPlugin` is options (not a plugin).

Here's the resolved version that combines both intents:

```typescript
    height: `${height}px`,
    margin: 0,
    pointerEvents: "none",
    transformOrigin: "center",
    zIndex: 100,
  })

  if (typeof optionsOrPlugin !== "function") {
    Object.assign((el as HTMLElement).style, defaultStyleReset)
    animation = el.animate(
      [
        {
          transform: "scale(1)",
          opacity: 1,

```
