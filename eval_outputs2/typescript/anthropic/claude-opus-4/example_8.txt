Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to add a line that initializes a `client` variable, while the other branch removed or never had this line. 

The conflict appears to be about whether to explicitly define the `client` variable. Looking at the context, I can see that:
1. The code is in a Vue Query context (based on the error message about `useQuery()`)
2. There's a `queryClient` parameter being referenced
3. The `client` variable is used later in the code (in `client.defaultMutationOptions` and when creating the `MutationObserver`)

Since the `client` variable is being used in the subsequent code, it needs to be defined. The HEAD branch's approach of providing a fallback to `useQueryClient()` when `queryClient` is not provided makes semantic sense.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
        'vue-query composables like "uesQuery()" should only be used inside a "setup()" function or a running effect scope. They might otherwise lead to memory leaks.',
      )
    }
  }

  const client = queryClient || useQueryClient()
  const options = computed(() => {
    return client.defaultMutationOptions(cloneDeepUnref(mutationOptions))
  })
  const observer = new MutationObserver(client, options.value)
  const state = reactive(observer.getCurrentResult())

```
