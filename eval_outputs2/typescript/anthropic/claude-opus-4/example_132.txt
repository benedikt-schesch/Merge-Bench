Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Wants to save `patchFileContents`, `packageVersion`, and `patchPath`
- **Right side**: Wants to save `patches` and `isRebasing`

Both sides are calling `savePatchApplicationState` with `packageDetails` as the first property, but with different additional properties. This appears to be a case where both sides have evolved the function signature differently.

Since both sets of properties seem semantically important (patch file contents/version/path on one side, and patches state/rebasing status on the other), the resolution should include all properties to preserve both intents:

```typescript
    }

    if (isRebasing || numPatchesAfterCreate > 1) {
      savePatchApplicationState({
        packageDetails,
        patchFileContents: diffResult.stdout.toString(),
        packageVersion,
        patchPath,
        patches: nextState,
        isRebasing: didFailWhileFinishingRebase,
      })
    } else {
      clearPatchApplicationState(packageDetails)
    }
