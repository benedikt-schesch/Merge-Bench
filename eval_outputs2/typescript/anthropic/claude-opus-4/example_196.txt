Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add the `googleClient` property to the class, but with different approaches:

- HEAD: Adds the property with a TODO comment indicating the type needs to be found
- The incoming branch: Adds the property with the proper type `GoogleClient` and also adds a new `stayAlive` property

The semantic intent is clear: both sides want to add the `googleClient` property, and the incoming branch has the complete implementation with the proper type. The incoming branch also introduces an additional `stayAlive` property that should be preserved.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```typescript
  private readonly histories: Collection<EventHistory>
  private readonly client: TxOperations
  private readonly systemTxOp: TxOperations
  private readonly activeSync: Record<string, boolean> = {}
  private readonly dummyWatches: DummyWatch[] = []
  private readonly googleClient: GoogleClient
  private stayAlive: boolean

  private inactiveTimer: NodeJS.Timeout

  isClosed: boolean = false


```
