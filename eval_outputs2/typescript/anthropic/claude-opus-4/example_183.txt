Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch): Calls `startSync()` with no arguments
- Incoming change: Calls `startSync(me)` with a `me` parameter

From the context, I can see that this code is part of a method that:
1. Sets some value with `this.user.userId`
2. Calls `syncOurEvents()` 
3. Then calls `startSync()`
4. Returns `this.user.userId`

The key question is whether `startSync()` needs the `me` parameter. Without seeing the method signature or the definition of `me` in the surrounding context, I cannot determine which version is semantically correct. The conflict represents a genuine ambiguity about whether this method requires a parameter or not.

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
        value: this.user.userId
      })
    }

    void this.syncOurEvents().then(async () => {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      await this.startSync()
=======
      await this.startSync(me)
>>>>>>> e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce
    })

    return this.user.userId
  }
