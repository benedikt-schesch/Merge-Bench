Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD**: Directly passes `options.value` to `observer.setOptions()`
- **Incoming change**: Wraps `options.value` with `queryClient.defaultMutationOptions()` before passing it

The incoming change appears to be adding a layer of default options processing, which is likely an intentional enhancement to ensure that mutation options are properly merged with client defaults. This is a common pattern in query/mutation libraries to ensure consistent behavior.

Since the incoming change adds functionality (default options merging) rather than just being a different approach, the semantic intent seems to be to enhance the options handling. Therefore, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```typescript
  }

  watch(
    options,
    () => {
      observer.setOptions(queryClient.defaultMutationOptions(options.value))
    },
    { flush: 'sync' },
  )

  onScopeDispose(() => {

```
