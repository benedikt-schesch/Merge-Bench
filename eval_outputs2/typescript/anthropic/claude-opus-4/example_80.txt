Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Adds three properties to the request body:
  - `max_completion_tokens: 1` - OpenAI's parameter
  - `max_tokens: 1` - Deprecated OpenAI parameter but still used by most OpenAI-compatible providers
  - `enable_thinking: false` - Qwen3 specific parameter

- **Incoming branch**: Wants to keep the body minimal with just the basic required fields

The intent of HEAD appears to be adding token limit parameters for compatibility with different AI providers (OpenAI and its compatible providers, plus Qwen3). The incoming branch seems to prefer a cleaner, minimal approach.

Since the HEAD branch is explicitly adding provider-specific parameters with comments explaining their purpose (compatibility with different providers), and these are likely important for proper functionality across different AI services, I'll preserve the HEAD changes:

```typescript
    }

    const body = {
      model: model.id,
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'hi' }],
      max_completion_tokens: 1, // openAI
      max_tokens: 1, // openAI deprecated 但大部分OpenAI兼容的提供商继续用这个头
      enable_thinking: false, // qwen3
      stream
    }

    try {
      await this.checkIsCopilot()

```
