Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the type annotation for the `room` parameter in the `filterItemForClient` method. The conflict appears to be about which type to use:
- HEAD wants to use `IRoomCache`
- The incoming change wants to use `IRoomListingData`

Without more context about the codebase and the intent behind each change, I cannot determine which type is correct or if there's a way to reconcile them. The semantic intent is ambiguous as both sides are trying to achieve type safety but with different type definitions.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
    return (filter)
      ? this.rooms.filter((room) => this.filterItemForClient(room, filter))
      : this.rooms;
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  protected filterItemForClient(room: IRoomCache, filter?: LobbyOptions['filter']) {
=======
  protected filterItemForClient(room: IRoomListingData, filter?: LobbyOptions['filter']) {
>>>>>>> 1a7da98cbeee551587e6119d06a39a441421827b
    if (!filter) {
      return true;
    }

    let isAllowed = true;

```
