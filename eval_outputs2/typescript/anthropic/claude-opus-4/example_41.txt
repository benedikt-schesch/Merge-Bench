Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- The HEAD branch is importing `stringify` from 'querystring' and `useCallback` from React
- The other branch (100a96a18d4f820a91b9a6cb23d4bf0200b44ea7) is only importing React

Since both sides want React imported, and the HEAD branch additionally needs `stringify` and `useCallback`, the semantic intent appears to be to keep both imports. The HEAD branch seems to have additional functionality that requires these extra imports.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
} from '@ant-design/icons';
import { history, useModel } from '@umijs/max';
import type { MenuProps } from 'antd';
import { Spin } from 'antd';
import { createStyles } from 'antd-style';
import { stringify } from 'querystring';
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';
import { outLogin } from '@/services/ant-design-pro/api';
import HeaderDropdown from '../HeaderDropdown';

export type GlobalHeaderRightProps = {

```
