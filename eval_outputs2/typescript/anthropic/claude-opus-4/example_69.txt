Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the constructor parameter type for the `StateModule` class. The conflict is about which type definition to use for the `_state` parameter:

- HEAD uses: `types.StateDefinition`
- The incoming change uses: `types.ApiStateDefinition`

Without more context about the codebase and the intent behind these changes, I cannot determine which type is correct or if they should be merged in a specific way. The semantic intent is ambiguous - it could be that:
1. One is replacing the other
2. They should both exist as separate parameters
3. One is a rename of the other

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```typescript
import { Module, ReExportVariableModule } from '../../module'
import * as strings from '../../strings'
import * as types from './typings'

export class StateModule extends Module {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  public constructor(name: string, private _state: types.StateDefinition) {
=======
  public constructor(
    name: string,
    private _state: types.ApiStateDefinition
  ) {
>>>>>>> 2df15ac6924fdfb93d9f36cc4acbbb1042845bc6
    super({
      path: `${name}.ts`,
      exportName: strings.varName(name),
    })
  }

```
