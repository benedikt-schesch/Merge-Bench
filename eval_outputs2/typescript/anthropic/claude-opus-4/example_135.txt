Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD side: Adds a console.log statement before the dependency installation
- Other side: Adds an import call and an expectation test before the dependency installation

Both changes appear to be adding different functionality before the `execSync` installation command. The HEAD side is adding logging, while the other side is adding import functionality and a test assertion. These changes don't conflict semantically - they're just adding different features at the same location.

Here's the resolved version that includes both changes:

```typescript
        await updatePackageJSON(dir, async (packageJSON) => {
          packageJSON.name = 'Name';
          packageJSON.productName = 'ProductName';
        });

        await api.import({ dir });

        expect(fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, 'forge.config.js'))).to.equal(true);

        console.log('installing dependencies');
        execSync(`${nodeInstaller} install`, {
          cwd: dir,
        });

```
