Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add imports to the type imports from the same module. The HEAD branch wants to add `AccountMethodHandler` while the other branch wants to add `AccountInfo` and `Invite`. Since both are adding different types and there's no semantic conflict between them, the resolution should include all the types from both sides.

```typescript

import { isAdminEmail } from './admin'
import { accountPlugin } from './plugin'
import type {
  AccountDB,
  AccountMethodHandler,
  AccountInfo,
  Invite,
  LoginInfo,
  OtpInfo,
  RegionInfo,
  SocialId,
  Workspace,

```
