Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD (current branch) has removed some type definitions
2. The incoming branch (1a7da98cbeee551587e6119d06a39a441421827b) wants to add two export type definitions: `ExtractUserData<T>` and `ExtractAuthData<T>`

The conflict appears to be about whether these type definitions should exist in this location. Without more context about why HEAD removed them or why the incoming branch wants to add them, I cannot determine the correct semantic intent.

Here's the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
  CREATING = 0,
  CREATED = 1,
  DISPOSING = 2,
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
export type ExtractUserData<T> = T extends ClientArray<infer U> ? U : never;
export type ExtractAuthData<T> = T extends ClientArray<infer _, infer U> ? U : never;

>>>>>>> 1a7da98cbeee551587e6119d06a39a441421827b
