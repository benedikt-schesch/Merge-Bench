Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to import the `cn` utility function from `@/lib/utils`, while the other branch doesn't have this import. 

Since this is just an import statement and the `cn` function is commonly used for className utilities in React components (especially with Tailwind CSS), and given that the component likely needs this utility function for styling purposes, I'll resolve this by keeping the import.

```typescript
import { isDesktop, isSafari } from "react-device-detect";
import { usePersistence } from "@/hooks/use-persistence";
import { Skeleton } from "../ui/skeleton";
import { Button } from "../ui/button";
import { FaCircleCheck } from "react-icons/fa6";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

type AnimatedEventCardProps = {
  event: ReviewSegment;
  selectedGroup?: string;
  updateEvents: () => void;

```
