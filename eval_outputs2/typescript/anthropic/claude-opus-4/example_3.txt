Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle a cancelled error with revert functionality. The key differences are:

1. HEAD uses `this.#revertState` (private field syntax)
2. The incoming change uses `this.revertState` (regular property) and adds `fetchStatus: 'idle'`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to revert to a previous state when a cancelled error with revert flag is encountered
- The incoming change also wants to ensure the `fetchStatus` is set to `'idle'` when reverting

The most likely correct resolution would combine both intents - use the private field syntax (which suggests a more recent refactoring) while also including the `fetchStatus: 'idle'` addition.

```typescript
            }),
          }
        case 'error':
          const error = action.error as unknown

          if (isCancelledError(error) && error.revert && this.#revertState) {
            return { ...this.#revertState, fetchStatus: 'idle' }
          }

          return {
            ...state,
            error: error as TError,

```
