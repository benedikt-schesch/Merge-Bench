Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD**: Comparing `p` with `email` (which is obtained from `this.getEmail()`)
- **Other branch**: Comparing `p` with `me`

The key insight is that this code is mapping attendees and checking if an attendee is "self" (the current user). The `me` parameter is already available in the function scope (from `this.getAttendees(event, me)`), and it appears the other branch is trying to use this existing parameter directly rather than calling `this.getEmail()` again.

Since `me` is already available as a parameter and likely represents the current user's email, using `me` is more efficient and cleaner than calling `this.getEmail()` again. This aligns with the DRY principle and makes the code more consistent.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
    }
    const attendees = this.getAttendees(event, me)
    if (attendees.length > 0) {
      const email = this.getEmail()
      res.attendees = attendees.map((p) => {
        if (p === me) {
          return { email: p, responseStatus: 'accepted', self: true }
        }
        return { email: p }
      })
    }

```
