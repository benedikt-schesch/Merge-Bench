Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Wants to keep the method signature and go directly to the `updateOne` call
- Incoming change: Wants to add a call to `getMe()` before the `updateOne` call

The semantic intent appears to be that the incoming change wants to retrieve the current user information from Google before updating the history. This could be for validation, logging, or to use the `me` variable in the update operation (though it's not used in the visible code).

Since the conflict shows an addition rather than a replacement, and without seeing how `me` is used later in the code, the safest resolution is to include the `getMe()` call from the incoming change:

```typescript
      workspace: this.user.workspace
    })
  }

  private async setEventHistoryId (calendarId: string, historyId: string): Promise<void> {
    const me = await this.googleClient.getMe()
    await this.histories.updateOne(
      {
        calendarId,
        userId: this.user.userId,
        workspace: this.user.workspace
```
