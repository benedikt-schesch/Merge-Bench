Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to render a `ColorSelect` component, but they differ in how they handle the `title` prop:

- **HEAD**: Wraps `title` with `getLocale(context, title)` to localize it
- **Other branch**: Passes `title` directly without localization

Given that:
1. The `context` variable is already defined at the top of the snippet from `AppContext`
2. The HEAD version appears to be adding localization support
3. The intent seems to be to display localized titles

The semantic intent of HEAD is to add internationalization/localization support, while the other branch keeps the original implementation. The HEAD version should be preferred as it represents an enhancement to support multiple languages.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
    const context = useContext(AppContext);
    const { display, value, title, icon, label, onChange, selected } = props;

    if (display === DisplayTypes.COLOR) {
        // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
        return <ColorSelect value={value as any} title={getLocale(context, title) as string} icon={icon} />;
    }

    if (display === DisplayTypes.FONT) {
        return (
            <div className={styles.fontSelect} style={{ fontFamily: value as string }}>
```
