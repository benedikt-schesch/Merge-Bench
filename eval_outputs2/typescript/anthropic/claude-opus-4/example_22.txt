Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - creating an options object that combines DEFAULTS with the provided opts parameter. The key differences are:

1. **Type annotation**: HEAD uses `Options` while the other branch uses `RegisterOptions`
2. **Object merging approach**: HEAD uses spread syntax (`...`) while the other branch uses `Object.assign`

Since both approaches achieve the same semantic result (merging objects), and without additional context about which type name is correct or which syntax style is preferred in the codebase, I cannot determine which resolution would be more appropriate.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
}

/**
 * Register TypeScript compiler instance onto node.js
 */
<<<<<<< HEAD
export function register (opts: Options = {}): Register {
  const options = { ...DEFAULTS, ...opts }
=======
export function register (opts: RegisterOptions = {}): Register {
  const options = Object.assign({}, DEFAULTS, opts)

  const originalJsHandler = require.extensions['.js'] // tslint:disable-line
  const service = create(options)
  const extensions = ['.ts']

  // Enable additional extensions when JSX or `allowJs` is enabled.

```
