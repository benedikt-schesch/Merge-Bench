Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD (current branch) adds three new admin endpoints:
  - GET endpoint to fetch users for a specific organization
  - POST endpoint to update a user
  - DELETE endpoint to delete an organization

- The incoming branch adds:
  - PUT endpoint to update/create an organization

These changes appear to be complementary rather than conflicting - they're adding different administrative functionality. The semantic intent on both sides is to expand the admin API capabilities, and there's no overlap in the routes themselves.

Here's the resolved version:

```typescript
// Teams
app.use("/teams", teamRouter);

// Admin
app.get("/admin/organizations", adminController.getOrganizations);
app.get("/admin/organization/:orgId/users", adminController.getUsersForOrg);
app.post("/admin/user/:userId", adminController.updateUser);
app.delete("/admin/organization/:orgId", adminController.deleteOrganization);
app.put("/admin/organization", adminController.putOrganization);

// License
app.get("/license", licenseController.getLicenseData);
app.get("/license/report", licenseController.getLicenseReport);
app.post(
```
