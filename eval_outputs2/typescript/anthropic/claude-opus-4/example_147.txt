Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD is importing both `CloseButtonProps` and `IconProps` from '../components'
- The incoming change is importing only `IconProps` from a more specific path '../components/Icons'

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants both `CloseButtonProps` and `IconProps`
- The incoming change wants to use a more specific import path for `IconProps`

To resolve this conflict while preserving both intents, I should:
1. Keep the `CloseButtonProps` import that HEAD needs
2. Use the more specific import path for `IconProps` from the incoming change

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { CloseButtonProps } from '../components';
import { IconProps } from '../components/Icons';

type Nullable<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]: T[P] | null;
};


```
