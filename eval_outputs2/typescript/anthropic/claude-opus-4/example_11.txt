Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - creating a mock function for testing. The only difference is the mocking library being used:

- HEAD is using `vi.fn()` (from Vitest)
- The other branch is using `jest.fn()` (from Jest)

Since the context shows this is a test file and the conflict is purely about which testing framework's mocking function to use, I cannot definitively resolve this without knowing which testing framework the project has standardized on. The semantic intent is identical - both want to create a mock function.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript

    expect(status.value).toStrictEqual('pending')
  })

  test('should use the current value for the queryKey when refetch is called', async () => {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const fetchFn = vi.fn()
=======
    const fetchFn = jest.fn()
>>>>>>> 3d6408484cb0d4287365fdd6ec93753ac0f44388
    const keyRef = ref('key11')
    const query = useQuery({
      queryKey: ['key10', keyRef],
      queryFn: fetchFn,
      enabled: false,

```
