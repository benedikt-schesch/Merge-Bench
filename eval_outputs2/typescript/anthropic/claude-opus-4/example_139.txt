Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to add a configuration line `USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS=true` while the other branch (d98ec0f6e0ce37e907b920bf3b34df018978a7c1) doesn't have this addition.

The semantic intent appears to be configuring Ollama settings. The HEAD branch wants to explicitly enable the use of Ollama text models with a boolean flag, which seems like a reasonable addition to the configuration block that's already setting up Ollama endpoints and models.

Since this appears to be an additive change that enhances the configuration without conflicting with the other branch's intent, I'll resolve by keeping the addition:

```typescript

          content += '\n# Local AI Configuration (using Ollama)\n';
          content += 'OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434\n';
          content += 'OLLAMA_MODEL=gemma3\n';
          content += 'OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text\n';
          content += 'USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS=true\n';
          content += '# Make sure Ollama is installed and running: https://ollama.ai/\n';
          content += '# Pull models with: ollama pull gemma3 && ollama pull nomic-embed-text\n';

          await fs.writeFile(envFilePath, content, 'utf8');
        } else {

```
