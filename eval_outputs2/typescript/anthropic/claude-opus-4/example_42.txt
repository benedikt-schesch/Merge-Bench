Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Imports several components including `AvatarDropdown`, `AvatarName`, `Footer`, `Question`, and `SelectLang` from `@/components`
- **Incoming branch (100a96a...)**: Appears to have removed this import line entirely

The semantic intent here seems to be:
- The current branch wants to use these components from `@/components`
- The incoming branch either doesn't need these components or has moved/refactored them elsewhere

Without more context about why the incoming branch removed these imports, and given that the rest of the file continues with other imports that both sides seem to agree on, I cannot determine the correct resolution. The conflict could be due to:
1. The components being genuinely not needed anymore
2. The components being imported elsewhere or in a different way
3. A refactoring that hasn't been completed

Since the intent is ambiguous, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
