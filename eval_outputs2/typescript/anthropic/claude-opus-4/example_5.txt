Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add import statements. The conflict appears to be about importing different types:

- HEAD wants to import `QueryClient` from `'./queryClient'`
- The incoming change wants to import `DeepUnwrapRef`, `MaybeRef`, and `WithQueryClientKey` from `'./types'`

Based on the semantic intent, both imports seem necessary for the module - they're importing different types from different modules. The resolution should include both import statements.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
  DefaultedQueryObserverOptions,
  QueryKey,
  QueryObserver,
  QueryObserverResult,
} from '@tanstack/query-core'
import type { QueryClient } from './queryClient'
import type { DeepUnwrapRef, MaybeRef, WithQueryClientKey } from './types'
import type { UseQueryOptions } from './useQuery'
import type { UseInfiniteQueryOptions } from './useInfiniteQuery'

export type UseBaseQueryReturnType<
  TData,

```
