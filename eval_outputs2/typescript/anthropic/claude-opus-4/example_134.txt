Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to export modules related to breakpoints, but with some differences:

**HEAD side:**
- Exports a specific type `_EuiThemeBreakpoint` aliased as `EuiBreakpointSize`
- Exports from `./current_breakpoint`
- Exports from `./current_breakpoint_hook`
- Exports from `./is_within_hooks`

**Incoming side:**
- Exports from `./breakpoint`
- Exports from `./current_breakpoint`
- Exports from `./current_breakpoint_hook`
- Exports from `./useIsWithinBreakpoints`

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to export current breakpoint functionality
2. HEAD wants to export a specific type from the global styling system
3. HEAD has `is_within_hooks` while incoming has `useIsWithinBreakpoints` (likely a rename)
4. Incoming has a general `./breakpoint` export while HEAD has a specific type export

Resolving by combining both intents:
