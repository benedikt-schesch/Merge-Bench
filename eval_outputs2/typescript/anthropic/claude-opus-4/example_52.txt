Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) is trying to import `baseUrl` from `@/api/baseUrl`, while the other side has removed or doesn't have this import.

Without seeing how `baseUrl` is used in the rest of the file, I cannot determine whether this import is necessary or not. The conflict appears to be about whether this import should be included, but I don't have enough context to understand the intent of both sides.

Therefore, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
import Chip from "../indicators/Chip";
import { capitalizeFirstLetter } from "@/utils/stringUtil";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
import { TbExclamationCircle } from "react-icons/tb";
import { TooltipPortal } from "@radix-ui/react-tooltip";
<<<<<<< HEAD
import { baseUrl } from "@/api/baseUrl";

type LivePlayerProps = {
  cameraRef?: (ref: HTMLDivElement | null) => void;
  containerRef?: React.MutableRefObject<HTMLDivElement | null>;
  className?: string;
