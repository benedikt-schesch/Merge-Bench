Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to find an integration from the `integrations` array, but they're using different values to match against:

- HEAD (current branch) is using `email` (which comes from `this.getEmail()`)
- The incoming change is using `me` (which is passed as a parameter to the function)

Given the semantic context:
1. The function `getAttendees` receives a `me` parameter that represents the current user
2. The `email` variable is obtained from `this.getEmail()` which likely also represents the current user's email
3. Both sides are trying to find the current user's integration from the list

The intent appears to be the same - find the current user's integration. The incoming change seems to be refactoring to use the `me` parameter that's already available instead of calling `this.getEmail()`. This is likely a better approach as it uses the parameter that's explicitly passed to the function.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
  private getAttendees (event: Event, me: string): string[] {
    const res = new Set<string>()
    const email = this.getEmail()
    for (const participant of event.participants) {
      const integrations = this.workspace.integrations.byContact.get(participant) ?? []
      const integration = integrations.find((p) => p === me) ?? integrations[0]
      if (integration !== undefined && integration !== '') {
        res.add(integration)
      } else {
        const contact = this.workspace.contacts.byId.get(participant)
        if (contact !== undefined) {

```
