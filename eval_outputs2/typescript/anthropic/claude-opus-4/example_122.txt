Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they want to execute a command when there are no submenu items. The only differences are formatting/spacing:

- HEAD has a space after `> 0)`
- The other branch has a space before the closing parenthesis in `> 0 )`
- HEAD has spaces around the object `{ value }`
- The other branch has no spaces in the object `{value}`

Since both achieve the same functionality, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version as it has more consistent spacing:

```typescript
        // item.onClick?.call(null, e, item.value, index, deep);
        const commandService: ICommandService = this.context.injector.get(ICommandService);
        this.props.onClick();

        const value = this.state.value;
        !(item.subMenuItems && item.subMenuItems.length > 0) && commandService.executeCommand(item.id, { value });
        // this.showMenu(false);
    };

    /**
     * user input change value from CustomLabel

```
