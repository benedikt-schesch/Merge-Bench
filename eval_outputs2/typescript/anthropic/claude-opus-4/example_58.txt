Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add a language to what appears to be a list of language codes/imports. The HEAD branch is trying to add `nl` (Dutch) while the other branch is trying to add `pl` (Polish). 

Since both additions are valid and don't conflict semantically (they're just adding different languages to the same list), the resolution should include both languages in alphabetical order to maintain consistency with the existing pattern.

```typescript
  hu,
  id,
  it,
  ja,
  ko,
  nl,
  pl,
  ['pt-BR']: ptBR,
  ru,
  th,
  tr,
  uk,

```
