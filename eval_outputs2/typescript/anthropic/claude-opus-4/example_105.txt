Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the `_onLeave` method but with different changes:

- **HEAD**: Changes the method from `private` to `protected` and removes the debug logging
- **Branch (1a7da98...)**: Keeps it as `private` but adds debug logging for the sessionId

The semantic intent appears to be:
- One side wants to make this method accessible to subclasses (protected)
- The other side wants to add debugging information

Since both changes seem valuable and don't conflict in terms of functionality, I'll merge both changes - keeping the `protected` visibility modifier while also including the debug logging:

```typescript

    // only effectively close connection when "onLeave" is fulfilled
    this._onLeave(client, closeCode).then(() => client.leave(closeCode));
  }

  protected async _onLeave(client: Client, code?: number): Promise<any> {
    debugMatchMaking('onLeave, sessionId: \'%s\'', client.sessionId);

    // call 'onLeave' method only if the client has been successfully accepted.
    client.state = ClientState.LEAVING;

    if (!this.clients.delete(client)) {

```
