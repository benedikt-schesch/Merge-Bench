Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD wants to set `stage: "stable"`
- The incoming branch wants to set `stage: "beta.6"`

Given that the version is "10.0.0" (a major version), and considering the typical software release cycle, this appears to be a conflict between:
1. A branch that has promoted the software to stable status
2. A branch that still has it in beta testing (specifically beta.6)

Since this is version 10.0.0 (a major release) and one side is marking it as "stable", this likely indicates that the beta period has ended and the software has been released. The "stable" designation would be the more recent/correct status for a major version release.

Therefore, the semantic intent appears to be that the software has progressed from beta to stable, and we should keep the "stable" value.

```typescript
export const constants = {
  appName: "CopyTranslator",
  nickName: "破晓",
  version: "10.0.0",
  stage: "stable",
  wiki: "https://copytranslator.gitee.io/guide",
  homepage: "https://copytranslator.gitee.io",
  downloadPage: "https://copytranslator.gitee.io/guide/download.html",
};
export const versionString = [
