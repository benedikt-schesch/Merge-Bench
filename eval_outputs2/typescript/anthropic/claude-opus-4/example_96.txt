Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Uses `this.channels.removeListener(topic, callback)` - appears to be using an event emitter pattern with a `channels` object
- **Right side**: Manually removes the callback from a `topicCallbacks` array using `indexOf` and a `spliceOne` utility

The conflict seems to be about two different approaches to managing subscriptions. The HEAD version uses a higher-level event emitter API, while the right side uses a lower-level array manipulation approach.

Without more context about which approach the codebase is standardizing on, or whether `this.channels` exists and is properly initialized, I cannot determine which implementation is correct. Both sides have valid approaches but they're incompatible implementations.

```typescript
        return this;
    }

    public async unsubscribe(topic: string, callback?: Callback) {
        if (callback) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
          this.channels.removeListener(topic, callback);
=======
          const index = topicCallbacks.indexOf(callback);
          spliceOne(topicCallbacks, index);
>>>>>>> 45a6d08d5025f5d350dc011907d4dbd35caf1261

        } else {
          this.channels.removeAllListeners(topic);
        }
