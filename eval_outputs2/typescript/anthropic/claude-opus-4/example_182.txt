Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the `e0ec8d420647866ae4cfd29946496b49106838ce` branch is adding a `release()` method that sets `stayAlive` to false and calls `updateTimer()`. This appears to be a cleanup/shutdown method for the calendar client.

Since the HEAD branch doesn't have any conflicting changes in this location (it's just empty), the intent seems clear - to add the release method. The semantic intent is to provide a way to properly clean up the calendar client instance.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
      calendarClient.updateTimer()
    }
    return calendarClient
  }

  async release (): Promise<void> {
    this.stayAlive = false
    this.updateTimer()
  }

  async authorize (code: string): Promise<string> {
    this.updateTimer()
    const me = await this.googleClient.authorize(code)
    if (me === undefined) {
```
