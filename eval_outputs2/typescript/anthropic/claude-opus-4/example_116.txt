Looking at this merge conflict, both sides appear to be trying to add language identifiers to what seems to be a union type of programming language strings.

- HEAD is trying to add: `'val'`
- The incoming change is trying to add: `'v'`, `'vala'`

Given the context of programming language identifiers and looking at common language naming conventions:
- `'v'` is likely referring to the V programming language
- `'vala'` is the Vala programming language
- `'val'` could be ambiguous - it might be an incomplete entry for Vala or another language

Since the incoming change has both `'v'` and `'vala'` which are distinct languages, and `'val'` appears to be either redundant or incorrect, the semantic intent seems clearer on the incoming side. The resolution should include both distinct languages from the incoming change.

```typescript
    | 'scala'
    | 'solidity'
    | 'swift'
    | 'toit'
    | 'typescript'
    | 'v'
    | 'vala'
    | 'vb'
    | 'zig';

export interface Language {
    /** Id of language. Added programmatically based on CELanguages key */

```
