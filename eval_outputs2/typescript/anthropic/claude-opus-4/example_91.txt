Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define which translators should be included in the "translator-auto" rule:

- HEAD has: `["google", "baidu"]`
- The incoming change has: `["google", "baidu", "youdao", "caiyun", "tencent"]`

The semantic intent appears to be that the incoming change is expanding the list of available translators from just 2 (google and baidu) to 5 (adding youdao, caiyun, and tencent). This looks like an enhancement to add more translator options.

Since the incoming change is a superset that includes all translators from HEAD plus additional ones, the resolution should accept the expanded list:

```typescript
  );

  config.setRule(
    "translator-auto",
    new GroupRule<TranslatorType>(
      ["google", "baidu", "youdao", "caiyun", "tencent"],
      "auto call",
      translatorTypes
    )
  );


```
