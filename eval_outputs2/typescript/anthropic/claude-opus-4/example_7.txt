Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import functions from 'vue-demi', but with different sets of imports.

- HEAD side: imports `getCurrentScope`, `onScopeDispose`, `ref`, `watchSyncEffect`
- Other side: imports the same functions PLUS `computed` and `unref`

Since the other side includes all the imports from HEAD plus additional ones (`computed` and `unref`), and there's no indication that these additional imports would cause issues, the semantic intent appears to be to have all the necessary imports available. The other side is more comprehensive.

Here's the resolved code:

```typescript
import {
  computed,
  getCurrentScope,
  onScopeDispose,
  ref,
  unref,
  watchSyncEffect,
} from 'vue-demi'
import { useQueryClient } from './useQueryClient'
import type { Ref } from 'vue-demi'
import type { QueryFilters as QF } from '@tanstack/query-core'
import type { MaybeRefDeep } from './types'
import type { QueryClient } from './queryClient'

```
