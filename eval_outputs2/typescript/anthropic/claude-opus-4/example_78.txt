Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the `AnthropicClient` class, but with different approaches:

- HEAD: Implements the `LLMClient` interface and explicitly defines a `type` property
- The other branch: Extends the `LLMClient` class

Without knowing the full context of whether `LLMClient` is an interface or a class, and whether the `type` property is needed, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The intent is ambiguous - one side treats `LLMClient` as an interface while the other treats it as a base class.

Here is the same snippet with the conflict preserved:

```typescript
import { LogLine } from "../../types/log";
import { AvailableModel } from "../../types/model";
import { LLMCache } from "../cache/LLMCache";
import { ChatCompletionOptions, LLMClient } from "./LLMClient";

<<<<<<< HEAD
export class AnthropicClient implements LLMClient {
  public type: "anthropic" = "anthropic";
=======
export class AnthropicClient extends LLMClient {
>>>>>>> 85483fe091544fc079015c62b6923b03f8b9caa7
  private client: Anthropic;
  private cache: LLMCache | undefined;
  public logger: (message: LogLine) => void;
  private enableCaching: boolean;


```
