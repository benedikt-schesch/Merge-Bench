```go
	// keys are read.
	getBuf *ringBuffer
	// setBuf is a buffer allowing us to batch/drop Sets during times of high
	// contention.
	setBuf chan *item
	// onEvict is called for item evictions.
	onEvict onEvictFunc
	// KeyToHash function is used to customize the key hashing algorithm.
	// Each key will be hashed using the provided function. If keyToHash value
	// is not set, the default keyToHash function is used.
	keyToHash func(interface{}) (uint64, uint64)
	// stop is used to stop the processItems goroutine.
