This appears to be a generated file, likely created by a tool like `go-bindata`. The conflict arises from the asset's metadata, specifically the modification time (`modTime`). The `HEAD` branch has an older timestamp (`1444419364`), while the incoming branch has a newer one (`1467390283`).

The semantic intent of this change is to update the embedded asset. In such cases, the newer version is almost always the correct one. The incoming branch represents a more recent state of the asset. Therefore, we should accept the changes from the incoming branch.

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreCraftcmsBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/CraftCMS", size: 120, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreDm = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xd2\x4b\xc9\x4d\xe2\xd2\xd2\x2b\x2a\x4e\x06\x92\x99\x79\x25\x40\x32\x27\x1b\x48\x54\x65\x16\x70\x01\x02\x00\x00\xff\xff\x1b\x86\x0d\x57\x1d\x00\x00\x00")
