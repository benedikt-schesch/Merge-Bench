Resolving this merge conflict requires understanding the evolution of the `validate` function call within the `UnaryClientInterceptor`.

*   **HEAD** represents an older version where the `validate` function only took the request object `req` as an argument.
*   **The incoming change** represents a newer, more feature-rich version. It passes not only the request but also the `context`, a `shouldFailFast` boolean, and an `onValidationErrCallback` function. These additional parameters are derived from the options passed to the interceptor, allowing for more configurable validation behavior.

The semantic intent of the incoming change is to enhance the validation logic with more context and configuration options. This is a clear improvement over the older version. Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the new function call signature.

```go
// Note that generated codes prior to protoc-gen-validate v0.6.0 do not provide an all-validation
// interface. In this case the interceptor fallbacks to legacy validation and `all` is ignored.
func UnaryClientInterceptor(opts ...Option) grpc.UnaryClientInterceptor {
	o := evaluateOpts(opts)
	return func(ctx context.Context, method string, req, reply interface{}, cc *grpc.ClientConn, invoker grpc.UnaryInvoker, opts ...grpc.CallOption) error {
		if err := validate(ctx, req, o.shouldFailFast, o.onValidationErrCallback); err != nil {
			return err
		}
		return invoker(ctx, method, req, reply, cc, opts...)
	}
}

```
