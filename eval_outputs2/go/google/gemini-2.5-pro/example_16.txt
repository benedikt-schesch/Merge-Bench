This is a common conflict in auto-generated files, such as those produced by `go-bindata`. These files embed assets into the Go binary. The conflict arises from re-running the generator tool on different branches or at different times.

The only substantive difference between the two sides is the `modTime` timestamp for the embedded file `conf/gitignore/Scrivener`.

*   **HEAD:** `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)` (October 9, 2015)
*   **Incoming Change:** `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)` (July 1, 2016)

The intent of both sides is to embed the file's metadata. In such cases, the newer timestamp from the incoming change is almost always the correct one, as it reflects a more recent generation of the asset bundle. The incoming change also has slightly cleaner formatting. Therefore, we will accept the incoming change.

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreScrivenerBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Scrivener", size: 140, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreSdcc = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x52\x56\x08\x76\x71\x76\x56\x28\x2e\x29\x4d\x4b\xe3\xd2\xd2\xcb\xc9\xcb\x06\x91\xc5\x25\x40\x32\x37\xb1\x00\x44\xa6\xe6\x02\xc9\xa2\xd4\x1c\x10\x09\x16\x2f\xae\xcc\xe5\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x8f\x5b\x05\xc4\x37\x00\x00\x00")
