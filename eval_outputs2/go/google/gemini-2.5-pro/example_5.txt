An expert in semantic merge conflict resolution would determine that one side is adding a new field `esc` to the `EventMouse` struct, likely to carry additional information like the raw terminal escape sequence for the event. The other side has no changes. The most logical resolution is to accept the addition of the new field, as it extends the functionality without breaking existing code that doesn't use it.

```go
	btn    ButtonMask
	mod    ModMask
	motion bool
	x      int
	y      int
	esc    string
}

// When returns the time when this EventMouse was created.
func (ev *EventMouse) When() time.Time {
	return ev.t

```
