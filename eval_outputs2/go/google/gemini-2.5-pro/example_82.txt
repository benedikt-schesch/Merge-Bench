An analysis of the two sides of the merge conflict suggests the following:

*   **`HEAD`** introduces a `var` block to define a set of reusable `PingRequest` structs for testing purposes. These variables (`goodPing`, `panicPing`, `nilPanicPing`) represent different test cases: a standard request, one designed to cause a panic, and one designed to cause a nil pointer panic. This is a common and useful pattern for writing tests.
*   **The other branch** (ending in `...878f3561`) has removed this block as part of a file move/refactor (`recovery/` to `interceptors/recovery/`).

**Semantic Resolution:**

The intent of `HEAD` is to add useful test data. The deletion from the other side was likely an incidental part of the refactoring and not a deliberate removal of functionality. Keeping the variables is the most logical choice as they are likely used by tests within the file.

A small correction is needed: the code in `HEAD` uses `pb_testproto`, but the surrounding code uses `testpb`. To ensure consistency and allow the code to compile, the alias should be `testpb`.

```go
	"google.golang.org/grpc"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/status"
)

var (
	goodPing     = &testpb.PingRequest{Value: "something", SleepTimeMs: 9999}
	panicPing    = &testpb.PingRequest{Value: "panic", SleepTimeMs: 9999}
	nilPanicPing = &testpb.PingRequest{Value: "nilpanic", SleepTimeMs: 9999}
)

type recoveryAssertService struct {
	testpb.TestServiceServer
}

func (s *recoveryAssertService) Ping(ctx context.Context, ping *testpb.PingRequest) (*testpb.PingResponse, error) {

```
