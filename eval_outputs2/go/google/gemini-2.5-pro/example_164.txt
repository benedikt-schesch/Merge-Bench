Resolving the conflict requires understanding the intended variables to be passed to the `decodePostgresOutgoing` function.

The `HEAD` branch uses `p.hooks` and `p.logger`. These are fields on the `PostgresParser` struct instance `p`. This is consistent with the `MODE_RECORD` case, which also passes `p.hooks` and `p.logger` to a similar function.

The other branch (`7dea4...`) uses `h` and `logger`. These variables are not defined within the scope of the `ProcessOutgoing` function, which would lead to a compilation error.

The semantic intent is clearly to use the `hooks` and `logger` associated with the current `PostgresParser` instance. Therefore, the version from `HEAD` is the correct one.

```go
func(p *PostgresParser) ProcessOutgoing(requestBuffer []byte, clientConn, destConn net.Conn, ctx context.Context) {
	switch models.GetMode() {
	case models.MODE_RECORD:
		encodePostgresOutgoing(requestBuffer, clientConn, destConn, p.hooks, p.logger, ctx)
	case models.MODE_TEST:
		decodePostgresOutgoing(requestBuffer, clientConn, destConn, p.hooks, p.logger, ctx)
	default:
		p.logger.Info("Invalid mode detected while intercepting outgoing http call", zap.Any("mode", models.GetMode()))
	}

}
