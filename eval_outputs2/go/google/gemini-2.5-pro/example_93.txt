This is a classic library migration conflict. The HEAD branch uses the older `jsonpb` package from `github.com/golang/protobuf/`, while the incoming change uses the newer `protojson` package from `google.golang.org/protobuf/`.

Both sides share the same intent: to unmarshal a JSON object into a protobuf message, while ignoring any fields in the JSON that are not defined in the protobuf schema. This is evident from the comments on both sides.

- The HEAD branch uses `AllowUnknownFields: true`.
- The incoming branch uses `DiscardUnknown: true`.

These two options are semantically equivalent for their respective libraries. Since the Go and protobuf ecosystem is standardizing on the `google.golang.org/protobuf` v2 API, the incoming change is the correct one to adopt as it represents a modernization of the codebase.

```go
	jsonContents, err := yaml.YAMLToJSON(yamlFileContents)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to convert gRPC API Configuration from YAML in '%v' to JSON: %v", yamlSourceLogName, err)
	}

	// As our GrpcAPIService is incomplete, accept unknown fields.
	unmarshaler := protojson.UnmarshalOptions{
		DiscardUnknown: true,
	}

	serviceConfiguration := apiconfig.GrpcAPIService{}
	if err := unmarshaler.Unmarshal(jsonContents, &serviceConfiguration); err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to parse gRPC API Configuration from YAML in '%v': %v", yamlSourceLogName, err)
