Both sides of the merge conflict are trying to achieve the same semantic goal: to correctly take the address of the loop iteration variable. In Go, the `for...range` loop reuses the same variable for each iteration. Taking its address directly (`&iface` if the loop was `for _, iface := range ifaces`) would result in all map entries pointing to the same memory location, which would hold the value of the last interface in the slice.

To prevent this, both branches create a new variable inside the loop's scope for each iteration, which can then be safely referenced.

*   **HEAD** uses `for _, tmp := range ifaces` and then `iface := tmp` inside the loop. The new `iface` variable is then used throughout the rest of the loop.
*   The other side uses `for _, iface := range ifaces` and then `t := iface` to create the copy, storing `&t` but continuing to use the original `iface` loop variable.

The approach in `HEAD` is slightly more idiomatic as it creates a new variable `iface` that is used consistently for the remainder of the loop body, avoiding the need for a separate temporary variable name (`t`). This makes the code a little cleaner. Therefore, the `HEAD` version is chosen for the resolution.

```go
	sort.Sort(rtr.v6)
	ifaces, err := net.Interfaces()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	for _, tmp := range ifaces {
		iface := tmp
		rtr.ifaces[iface.Index] = &iface
		var addrs ipAddrs
		ifaceAddrs, err := iface.Addrs()
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}

```
