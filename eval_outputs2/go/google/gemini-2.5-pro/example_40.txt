This type of conflict is common in auto-generated code, such as files created by tools like `go-bindata` which embed file assets into a Go binary.

1.  **Intent of `HEAD`:** To embed the file `conf/gitignore/ExtJs` with a modification timestamp of `1444419364` (October 2015). It also has a minor code formatting difference (an extra space).
2.  **Intent of `73fedc7...`:** To embed the same file `conf/gitignore/ExtJs` with a modification timestamp of `1467390283` (July 2016).

All other file metadata (`name`, `size`, `mode`) is identical. This indicates that the file content itself has likely not changed, but the asset embedding tool was re-run at a later date, capturing a newer file modification time. In such cases, the semantically correct approach is to use the version with the most recent timestamp, as it reflects the latest state of the auto-generated assets.

The resolved code adopts the version with the newer timestamp.

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreExtjsBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/ExtJs", size: 38, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreFancy = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xd2\x2b\x4a\x4a\xe6\xd2\xd2\x4b\xab\x4c\xe6\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\xf9\xc8\xaa\x14\x0c\x00\x00\x00")
