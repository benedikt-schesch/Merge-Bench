Resolving this merge conflict requires understanding the code generated by different versions of `protoc-gen-go`.

*   **The `HEAD` branch** contains a type alias: `type Empty = emptypb.Empty`. This is generated when a `.proto` file uses `import public "google/protobuf/empty.proto";`. It re-exports the `Empty` type for convenience. The comment `// Symbols defined in public import...` which precedes the conflict refers to this line.

*   **The `84668698ea25b64748563aa20726db66a6b8d299` branch** contains a version compatibility check: `const _ = proto.ProtoPackageIsVersion3`. This is standard boilerplate added by modern versions of `protoc-gen-go` that use the `google.golang.org/protobuf` module (APIv2). Its presence indicates an upgrade of the project's protobuf toolchain.

The conflict arises from a toolchain upgrade that replaced one piece of generated code with another. However, both pieces serve valid and distinct purposes. The version check is essential for compatibility with the newer protobuf library, and the type alias fulfills the promise of the `public import` directive in the source `.proto` file. Modern generated files typically contain both.

The correct resolution is to combine both intents, preserving the crucial version check from the newer toolchain while also keeping the type alias that the preceding comment refers to. The conventional order is to place the version check first, followed by the type alias.

```go
	reflect "reflect"
)

// Symbols defined in public import of google/protobuf/empty.proto.

// This is a compile-time assertion to ensure that this generated file
// is compatible with the proto package it is being compiled against.
// A compilation error at this line likely means your copy of the
// proto package needs to be updated.
const _ = proto.ProtoPackageIsVersion3 // please upgrade the proto package

type Empty = emptypb.Empty
