The conflict arises from one branch adding a new `FileRecord` entity to a list of database models for migration, while the other branch has no changes in this section. The clear intent is to register the new `FileRecord` entity with the database. Therefore, the resolution is to include the line from the incoming branch.

```go
		&entity.PluginUserConfig{},
		&entity.Review{},
		&entity.Badge{},
		&entity.BadgeGroup{},
		&entity.BadgeAward{},
		&entity.FileRecord{},
		&entity.PluginKVStorage{},
	}

	roles = []*entity.Role{
		{ID: 1, Name: "User", Description: "Default with no special access."},

```
