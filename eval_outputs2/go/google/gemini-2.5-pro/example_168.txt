An expert in semantic merge conflict resolution would analyze the intent behind both changes.

*   **HEAD** introduces a function named `InitialiseTest` which returns a custom `InitialiseTestReturn` struct. The name suggests this function is responsible for setting up or preparing a test environment. The `testsets` parameter is a pointer to a slice of strings.
*   **The other branch (`7dea42d...`)** renames the function to `Test`, changes the return type to a `bool` (likely for success/failure), and changes the `testsets` parameter from a pointer to a regular slice `[]string`. It also adds a new parameter, `noiseConfig`, for configuring test noise. It declares a `proxy.ProxySet` variable, which is a logical component for a function that runs a network-based test.

**Semantic Resolution:**
The change in the other branch (`7dea42d...`) appears to be a more complete and intentional refactoring. The name `Test` is more direct, the `bool` return type is standard for indicating a test outcome, and the addition of `noiseConfig` adds functionality. Changing `*[]string` to `[]string` is a common and idiomatic improvement in Go. This version seems to supersede the `InitialiseTest` function by both renaming it and enhancing its capabilities to fully execute the test, not just initialize it.

Therefore, the most logical resolution is to accept the changes from the `7dea42d...` branch.

```go
		logger: logger,
		mutex:  sync.Mutex{},
	}
}

func (t *tester) Test(path string, proxyPort uint32, testReportPath string, appCmd string, testsets []string, appContainer, appNetwork string, Delay uint64, passThorughPorts []uint, apiTimeout uint64, noiseConfig map[string]interface{}) bool {

	var ps *proxy.ProxySet

	stopper := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(stopper, os.Interrupt, os.Kill, syscall.SIGHUP, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGQUIT, syscall.SIGTERM, syscall.SIGKILL)

	models.SetMode(models.MODE_TEST)

```
