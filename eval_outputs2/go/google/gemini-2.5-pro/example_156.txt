Based on the comments provided, the intent of the merge seems to be an immediate update of an item in the cache store.

The `HEAD` version:
- Passes the entire `item` struct (`i`) to `c.store.Update`.
- Includes a comment clarifying the reason: "The expiration must also be immediately updated to prevent items from being prematurely removed from the map."
- This implementation ensures that not only the value but also the expiration and cost metadata are available for the update operation.

The `29b4dd7a077785696ba5422081b3c301d4c1e5f1` version:
- Passes `keyHash`, `conflictHash`, and only the `i.value` to `c.store.Update`.
- This signature suggests an update of only the value for a given key, without considering the item's expiration. This contradicts the explicit requirement mentioned in the `HEAD` comment.

The `HEAD` version is semantically superior because it addresses the critical need to update the item's expiration time to maintain cache consistency. The other version appears to have lost this important piece of logic during a refactor. Therefore, the `HEAD` version is chosen for the resolution.

```go
		value:      value,
		cost:       cost,
		expiration: expiration,
	}
	// Attempt to immediately update hashmap value and set flag to update so the
	// cost is eventually updated. The expiration must also be immediately updated
	// to prevent items from being prematurely removed from the map.
	if c.store.Update(i, c.ttlMap) {
		i.flag = itemUpdate
	}
	// Attempt to send item to policy.
	select {
	case c.setBuf <- i:
