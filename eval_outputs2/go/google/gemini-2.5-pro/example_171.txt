The user wants me to resolve a merge conflict in a Go code snippet.

**Analyzing the conflict:**

*   **HEAD:** This branch calls a function `t.RunTestSet` with 15 arguments. Several of these arguments are accessed through a struct named `initialisedValues` (e.g., `initialisedValues.YamlStore`, `initialisedValues.LoadedHooks`).
*   **Incoming Change (47736ed...):** This branch also calls `t.RunTestSet`.
    *   It uses local variables (`ys`, `loadedHooks`, `testReportFS`, `ctx`) instead of accessing them from the `initialisedValues` struct. This is likely a minor refactoring.
    *   Crucially, it adds a 16th argument: a boolean `false` at the end of the call. This indicates the function signature of `t.RunTestSet` has been updated in this branch to accept a new parameter.

**Synthesizing the Intent:**

*   The core intent of both branches is to call the `t.RunTestSet` function to execute a test set.
*   The incoming branch's primary semantic change is adapting the function call to a new signature that includes an additional boolean parameter. This is a necessary functional update that must be preserved for the code to compile and run correctly after the merge.
*   The change from `initialisedValues.SomeField` to a local variable `someField` is a stylistic or refactoring change.

**Resolution Strategy:**

The most robust way to merge these changes is to combine the intents. We must adopt the new function signature from the incoming branch (with the extra `false` argument). For the other arguments, using the more explicit `initialisedValues.SomeField` from the `HEAD` branch is safer, as it doesn't rely on local variables that might not be declared in the final merged code.

Therefore, the resolution is to take the argument list from `HEAD` and append the new `false` argument from the incoming branch.

```go
		// checking whether the provided testset match with a recorded testset.
		if _, ok := initialisedValues.SessionsMap[sessionIndex]; !ok {
			t.logger.Info("no testset found with: ", zap.Any("name", sessionIndex))
			continue
		}
		testRunStatus := t.RunTestSet(sessionIndex, path, testReportPath, appCmd, appContainer, appNetwork, Delay, 0, initialisedValues.YamlStore, initialisedValues.LoadedHooks, initialisedValues.TestReportFS, nil, apiTimeout, initialisedValues.Ctx, noiseConfig, false)
		switch testRunStatus {
		case models.TestRunStatusAppHalted:
			testRes = false
			exitLoop = true
		case models.TestRunStatusFaultUserApp:

```
