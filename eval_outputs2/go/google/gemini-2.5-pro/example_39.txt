This is a common conflict in files generated by tools like `go-bindata`. The tool embeds file assets into the Go binary, and part of the generated code includes the file's metadata, such as its modification time.

The only semantic difference between the two branches is the `modTime` of the embedded file.
- `HEAD` has a modification time of `time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`.
- The other branch has a modification time of `time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`.

Since the file name, size, and mode are identical, it's highly likely the content is the same and the file was simply re-saved or the generation tool was re-run at a later date on the other branch. In such cases, the convention is to take the later timestamp. The other branch also has slightly cleaner formatting. Therefore, the resolution is to accept the version from the incoming branch.

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreExpressionengineBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/ExpressionEngine", size: 342, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreExtjs = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\x4b\x2c\x4a\xce\xc8\x2c\x49\x4d\x2e\xe1\x4a\xca\xcf\x2f\x29\x2e\x29\x4a\x2c\xd0\xcb\x2a\xce\xcf\xe3\x4a\x2a\xcd\xcc\x49\xd1\xe7\x4a\xad\x28\xd1\xe7\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x9c\x9c\x0a\x09\x26\x00\x00\x00")
