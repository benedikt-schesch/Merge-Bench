Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to improve the error message, with slightly different wording:

- HEAD uses: "an unexpected error while marshaling JSONPBMarshaler"
- The other branch uses: "an unexpected error occurred when marshaling JSONPBMarshaler"

Both convey the same intent - reporting an unexpected error during marshaling. The second version ("occurred when") is slightly more grammatically standard than "while marshaling", so I'll resolve in favor of that version.

```go
func TestMarshalJSONPBMarshaler(t *testing.T) {
	rawJson := `{ "foo": "bar", "baz": [0, 1, 2, 3] }`
	msg := dynamicMessage{RawJson: rawJson}
	str, err := new(Marshaler).MarshalToString(&msg)
	if err != nil {
		t.Errorf("an unexpected error occurred when marshaling JSONPBMarshaler: %v", err)
	}
	if str != rawJson {
		t.Errorf("marshaling JSON produced incorrect output: got %s, wanted %s", str, rawJson)
	}
}

```
