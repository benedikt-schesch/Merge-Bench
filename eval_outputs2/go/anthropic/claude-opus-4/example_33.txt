Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the same line of code that creates a `bindataFileInfo` struct. The only difference between the two versions is the `modTime` field:

- HEAD version: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- Incoming version: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

Additionally, there's a minor formatting difference in spacing after `info:` in the asset creation line.

Since both changes appear to be updating the modification time (likely due to regenerating the bindata file at different times), and the incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 > 1444419364), the semantic intent is to use the most recent version.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreEclipseBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Eclipse", size: 458, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreEiffelstudio = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x52\x56\x08\xc9\x48\x55\x48\xce\xcf\x2d\xc8\xcc\x49\x2c\xc9\xcc\xcf\x53\x48\xc9\x2c\x4a\x4d\x2e\xc9\xaf\xe4\x72\xf5\x74\x73\x77\xf5\x2b\xe6\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x6b\x6c\xf5\x49\x23\x00\x00\x00")
