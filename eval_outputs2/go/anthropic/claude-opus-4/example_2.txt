Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add new configuration options to what appears to be a struct definition:

- HEAD is adding `OutputFile` and `OutputFormat` fields (likely for controlling output destination and format)
- The other branch is adding `StopOn403` field (likely for controlling behavior when encountering 403 Forbidden responses)

Since these are independent features that don't conflict semantically, the resolution should include both sets of changes:

```go
	TLSSkipVerify bool
	Data          string
	Quiet         bool
	Colors        bool
	Wordlist      string
	OutputFile    string
	OutputFormat  string
	StopOn403     bool
	Delay         optRange
	Filters       []FilterProvider
	Matchers      []FilterProvider
	Threads       int
	Context       context.Context

```
