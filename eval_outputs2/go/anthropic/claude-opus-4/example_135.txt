Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add an optional field to the `ABitOfEverythingServiceUpdateV22Opts` struct, but with slightly different names:

- HEAD: `UpdateMaskPaths`
- The other branch: `UpdateMask`

Without more context about the codebase conventions and the specific API being implemented, I cannot determine which naming is semantically correct. The conflict appears to be about naming convention rather than functionality, and both could be valid depending on:

1. Whether this represents multiple paths (suggesting `UpdateMaskPaths`) 
2. Whether this is a standard update mask field (suggesting `UpdateMask`)
3. What the API specification or protobuf definition specifies

Since the intent is ambiguous without additional context, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict intact:

```go

@return interface{}
*/

type ABitOfEverythingServiceUpdateV22Opts struct { 
<<<<<<< HEAD
	UpdateMaskPaths optional.Interface
=======
	UpdateMask optional.Interface
>>>>>>> 0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6
}

func (a *ABitOfEverythingServiceApiService) ABitOfEverythingServiceUpdateV22(ctx context.Context, abeUuid string, body ExamplepbABitOfEverything, localVarOptionals *ABitOfEverythingServiceUpdateV22Opts) (interface{}, *http.Response, error) {
	var (
		localVarHttpMethod = strings.ToUpper("Patch")
