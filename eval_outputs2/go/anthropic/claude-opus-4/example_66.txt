Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD branch is defining type aliases and constants for `NullValue` from the `structpb` package
2. The incoming branch is adding a compile-time assertion comment and constant to ensure proto package version compatibility

These changes appear to be complementary rather than conflicting - the HEAD changes are about exposing symbols from structpb, while the incoming changes are about ensuring proto package compatibility. Both should be kept.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	reflect "reflect"
)

// Symbols defined in public import of google/protobuf/struct.proto.

// This is a compile-time assertion to ensure that this generated file
// is compatible with the proto package it is being compiled against.
// A compilation error at this line likely means your copy of the
// proto package needs to be updated.
const _ = proto.ProtoPackageIsVersion3 // please upgrade the proto package

type NullValue = structpb.NullValue

const NullValue_NULL_VALUE = structpb.NullValue_NULL_VALUE

var NullValue_name = structpb.NullValue_name
var NullValue_value = structpb.NullValue_value

```
