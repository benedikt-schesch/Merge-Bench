Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the `HEAD` branch has the original struct fields, while the incoming branch (`bcba6ba3a99353be48a08f3a022962daaa3f7d1a`) is trying to add a new field `RequesterPays bool` between `StorageClass` and `AccessKey`.

This appears to be a straightforward addition of a new configuration field for S3 functionality. The intent is clear - to add support for requester pays buckets in S3. There's no semantic conflict here, just a new feature being added.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	// S3
	Endpoint       string
	Region         string
	RegionSet      bool
	StorageClass   string
	RequesterPays  bool
	AccessKey      string
	SecretKey      string
	Profile        string
	UseContentType bool
	UseSSE         bool
```
