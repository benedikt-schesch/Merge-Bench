Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they're declaring the same struct fields with identical purposes. The only difference is:

- HEAD uses `interface{}` type
- The other branch uses `any` type

Since Go 1.18, `any` is an alias for `interface{}`, so they are semantically identical. The conflict appears to be purely cosmetic, likely from a codebase modernization effort to use the newer `any` type.

Given that the newer branch is using the more modern Go idiom (`any`), and both achieve the same semantic intent, I'll resolve in favor of the more modern syntax:

```go
// type serverStreamingRetryingStream is the implementation of grpc.ClientStream that acts as a
// proxy to the underlying call. If any of the RecvMsg() calls fail, it will try to reestablish
// a new ClientStream according to the retry policy.
type serverStreamingRetryingStream struct {
	grpc.ClientStream
	bufferedSends []any // single message that the client can sen
	wasClosedSend bool  // indicates that CloseSend was closed
	parentCtx     context.Context
	callOpts      *options
	streamerCall  func(ctx context.Context) (grpc.ClientStream, error)
	mu            sync.RWMutex
}

```
