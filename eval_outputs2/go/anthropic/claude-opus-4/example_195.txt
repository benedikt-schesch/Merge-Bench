Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch adds a check for component revisions after checking deployments, while the other branch (47a565d00d0bde2f49b1a615defd1089a2bae9c2) doesn't have this additional check.

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to check that deployments are empty in both hub and worker contexts
- HEAD additionally wants to verify that controller revisions are also cleaned up in the worker context

Since this appears to be in a test file checking cleanup/deletion scenarios, the additional validation in HEAD seems intentional and valuable for ensuring complete cleanup. The other branch likely just didn't have this additional check yet.

Here's the resolved conflict, keeping the additional component revision check from HEAD:

```go
				g.Expect(k8sClient.List(hubCtx, deploys, client.InNamespace(namespace))).Should(Succeed())
				g.Expect(len(deploys.Items)).Should(Equal(0))
				deploys = &v13.DeploymentList{}
				g.Expect(k8sClient.List(workerCtx, deploys, client.InNamespace(namespace))).Should(Succeed())
				g.Expect(len(deploys.Items)).Should(Equal(0))
				// check component revision
				compRevs := &v13.ControllerRevisionList{}
				g.Expect(k8sClient.List(workerCtx, compRevs, client.InNamespace(prodNamespace))).Should(Succeed())
				g.Expect(len(compRevs.Items)).Should(Equal(0))
			}, time.Minute).Should(Succeed())
		})
