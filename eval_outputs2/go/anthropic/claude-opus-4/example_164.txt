Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call `decodePostgresOutgoing` with slightly different parameters. The key difference is in the last two parameters:

- HEAD version: `p.hooks, p.logger, ctx`
- Other version: `h, logger, ctx`

Given the context and the pattern established in the `MODE_RECORD` case (which uses `p.hooks, p.logger`), it appears that the HEAD version is consistent with the existing code structure where `p` is the receiver and we're accessing its fields.

The other version seems to be using undefined variables `h` and `logger` which don't appear to be in scope based on the function signature.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
func(p *PostgresParser) ProcessOutgoing(requestBuffer []byte, clientConn, destConn net.Conn, ctx context.Context) {
	switch models.GetMode() {
	case models.MODE_RECORD:
		encodePostgresOutgoing(requestBuffer, clientConn, destConn, p.hooks, p.logger, ctx)
	case models.MODE_TEST:
		decodePostgresOutgoing(requestBuffer, clientConn, destConn, p.hooks, p.logger, ctx)
	default:
		p.logger.Info("Invalid mode detected while intercepting outgoing http call", zap.Any("mode", models.GetMode()))
	}

}
```
