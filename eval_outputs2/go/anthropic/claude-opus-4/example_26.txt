Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to create the same `bindataFileInfo` structure with identical values except for:

1. The `modTime` timestamp: HEAD has `1444419364` while the other branch has `1467390283`
2. A minor formatting difference: HEAD has two spaces after `info:` while the other branch has one space

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a tool like go-bindata), and both sides are semantically trying to achieve the same thing (creating a file info structure), the most recent timestamp should be used. The formatting difference is negligible but we should maintain consistency.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confReadmeDefaultBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/readme/Default", size: 23, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

// Asset loads and returns the asset for the given name.
// It returns an error if the asset could not be found or

```
