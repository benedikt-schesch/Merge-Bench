Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same `bindataFileInfo` struct initialization, but with different `modTime` values:

- HEAD has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- The incoming change has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The only difference between the two versions is the timestamp. The incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), which likely represents a more recent update to the file metadata.

Additionally, there's a minor formatting difference in the spacing after `info:` - the incoming change has one space while HEAD has two spaces. The single space appears to be more consistent with Go formatting standards.

Since this appears to be generated code (likely from a tool that embeds files as Go code), and the incoming change has the more recent timestamp, I'll resolve this by keeping the incoming change:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreKicadBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/KiCAD", size: 208, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreKohana = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x4a\x2c\x28\xc8\xc9\x4c\x4e\x2c\xc9\xcc\xcf\xd3\x4f\x4e\x4c\xce\x48\xd5\xd7\xe2\x42\x16\xcb\xc9\x4f\x2f\x06\x0a\x01\x02\x00\x00\xff\xff\x96\xfe\x7e\x2e\x27\x00\x00\x00")
