Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call the `recordMessage` function but with different parameter lists:

- **HEAD**: Calls `recordMessage` with 7 parameters
- **Incoming branch**: Calls `recordMessage` with 10 parameters (adds `logStr`, `reqTimestampMock`, and `logger`)

The incoming branch appears to be adding additional logging/debugging capabilities to the `recordMessage` function. Since this seems to be an intentional enhancement (adding more parameters for better logging), the semantic intent appears to be to use the version with more parameters.

Here's the resolved code:

```go

		go func() {
			// Recover from panic and gracefully shutdown
			defer h.Recover(pkg.GenerateRandomID())
			defer utils.HandlePanic()
			recordMessage(h, requestBuffer, responseBuffer, logStr, mongoRequests, mongoResponses, opReq, ctx, reqTimestampMock, logger)
		}()
		requestBuffer = []byte("read form client connection")

	}
