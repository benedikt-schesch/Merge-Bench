Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to add entities to what appears to be a list of database models or entity configurations. The conflict shows:

- HEAD (current branch): Has the list ending with `&entity.BadgeAward{}`
- Incoming branch: Adds `&entity.FileRecord{}` after `&entity.BadgeAward{}`

Both changes seem intentional - one branch kept the original list while another branch added a new FileRecord entity. Since both sides are adding to a list and there's no semantic conflict between having BadgeAward and FileRecord entities, the resolution should include both.

```go
		&entity.PluginUserConfig{},
		&entity.Review{},
		&entity.Badge{},
		&entity.BadgeGroup{},
		&entity.BadgeAward{},
		&entity.FileRecord{},
		&entity.PluginKVStorage{},
	}

	roles = []*entity.Role{
		{ID: 1, Name: "User", Description: "Default with no special access."},

```
