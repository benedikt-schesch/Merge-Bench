Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle section processing, but they're calling different functions:

- HEAD: `decodeOpMsgSectionSingle(actualSection)`
- The other branch: `extractSectionSingle(expectedSection)`

The key difference is:
1. Different function names (`decodeOpMsgSectionSingle` vs `extractSectionSingle`)
2. Different parameters (`actualSection` vs `expectedSection`)

Based on the context, it appears that the HEAD version is incorrectly using `actualSection` when it should be processing the `expectedSection` (since we're inside a case that checks `expectedSection`). The other branch correctly uses `expectedSection`.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
		}
		logger.Debug("the matching score for sectionSequence", zap.Any("", score))
		return score
	case strings.HasPrefix(expectedSection, "{ SectionSingle msg:"):
		var expectedMsgsStr string
		expectedMsgsStr, err := extractSectionSingle(expectedSection)
		if err != nil {
			logger.Error("failed to fetch the msgs from the single section of recorded OpMsg", zap.Error(err))
			return 0
		}
		// // Define the regular expression pattern

```
