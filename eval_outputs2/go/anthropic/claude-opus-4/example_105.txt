Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are calling `runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext`, but they differ in the number of arguments:

- HEAD version: 3 arguments - `ctx, mux, req`
- Incoming version: 4 arguments - `ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello"`

The incoming version adds a fourth parameter which appears to be the full RPC method path. This suggests that the API for `AnnotateIncomingContext` has been updated to include the method path as an additional parameter, likely for better routing or logging purposes.

Since this appears to be an API update where the method now requires the RPC path, I'll resolve by accepting the incoming change with the 4-argument version:

```go
		ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(req.Context())
		defer cancel()
		var stream runtime.ServerTransportStream
		ctx = grpc.NewContextWithServerTransportStream(ctx, &stream)
		inboundMarshaler, outboundMarshaler := runtime.MarshalerForRequest(mux, req)
		rctx, err := runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext(ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello")
		if err != nil {
			runtime.HTTPError(ctx, mux, outboundMarshaler, w, req, err)
			return
		}
		resp, md, err := local_request_Greeter_SayHello_3(rctx, inboundMarshaler, server, req, pathParams)

```
