Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to improve the error logging when failing to write a reply message to the mongo client.

- HEAD (current branch): Adds a basic error log with just the error
- Incoming change: Adds the same error log but with additional context (client conn id and dest conn id)

The incoming change is clearly superior as it provides more debugging information while maintaining the same intent. Both sides want to log the error, but the incoming change provides better context for troubleshooting.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```go
				}

				// write the reply to mongo client
				_, err = destConn.Write(requestBuffer1)
				if err != nil {
					logger.Error("failed to write the reply message to mongo client", zap.Error(err), zap.Any("client conn id", clientConnId), zap.Any("dest conn id", destConnId))
					return
				}

				// logStr += fmt.Sprintln("after writting response to the client: ", time.Since(started), "current time is: ", time.Now())


```
