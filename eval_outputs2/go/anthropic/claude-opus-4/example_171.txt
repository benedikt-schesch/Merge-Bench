Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are calling the same `RunTestSet` method but with slightly different arguments. The key differences are:

1. **HEAD** uses `initialisedValues.YamlStore`, `initialisedValues.LoadedHooks`, `initialisedValues.TestReportFS`, and `initialisedValues.Ctx`
2. **Incoming branch** uses `ys`, `loadedHooks`, `testReportFS`, and `ctx`, and adds an additional boolean parameter `false` at the end

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD is using fields from an `initialisedValues` struct
- The incoming branch is using local variables and has added a new boolean parameter to the method signature

Since the incoming branch has an additional parameter, it likely represents a newer version of the API. The resolution should use the local variables (as they're likely extracted from `initialisedValues` earlier in the code) and include the new boolean parameter.

```go
		// checking whether the provided testset match with a recorded testset.
		if _, ok := initialisedValues.SessionsMap[sessionIndex]; !ok {
			t.logger.Info("no testset found with: ", zap.Any("name", sessionIndex))
			continue
		}
		testRunStatus := t.RunTestSet(sessionIndex, path, testReportPath, appCmd, appContainer, appNetwork, Delay, 0, ys, loadedHooks, testReportFS, nil, apiTimeout, ctx, noiseConfig, false)
		switch testRunStatus {
		case models.TestRunStatusAppHalted:
			testRes = false
			exitLoop = true
		case models.TestRunStatusFaultUserApp:

```
