Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that there are two changes being merged:

1. The HEAD branch adds `omitempty` to the `Objects` field and marks it as deprecated with a comment
2. The incoming branch (7d20443...) changes the `Assertions` field type from `map[string][]string` to `map[string]map[string][]string` (adding an extra level of nesting)

Both changes appear to be intentional and non-conflicting - they modify different aspects of the struct. The semantic intent seems to be:
- Make the `Objects` field optional in JSON/YAML output when empty (and mark it as deprecated)
- Change the structure of `Assertions` to support a more complex nested mapping

Here's the resolved version that incorporates both changes:

```go

type HttpSpec struct {
	Metadata         map[string]string      `json:"metadata" yaml:"metadata"`
	Request          models.HttpReq         `json:"req" yaml:"req"`
	Response         models.HttpResp        `json:"resp" yaml:"resp"`
	Objects          []*models.OutputBinary `json:"objects" yaml:"objects,omitempty"` //deprecated.
	Assertions       map[string]map[string][]string   `json:"assertions" yaml:"assertions,omitempty"`
	Created          int64                  `json:"created" yaml:"created,omitempty"`
	ReqTimestampMock time.Time              `json:"reqTimestampMock" yaml:"reqTimestampMock,omitempty"`
	ResTimestampMock time.Time              `json:"resTimestampMock" yaml:"resTimestampMock,omitempty"`
}
```
