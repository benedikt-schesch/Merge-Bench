Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar goals but with different versions of the same libraries:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Using v1 of grpc-gateway and the older `github.com/golang/protobuf/proto`
- **Incoming change (right side)**: Using v2 of grpc-gateway and the newer `google.golang.org/protobuf/proto`

The semantic intent is clear: the incoming change is upgrading to v2 of grpc-gateway and the newer protobuf library. Since the incoming change appears to be a deliberate upgrade (v1 to v2), and it's using the newer, recommended protobuf import path, the resolution should accept the v2 changes.

```go
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
	"net/http/httptest"
	"testing"

	"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime"
	pb "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime/internal/examplepb"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/status"
	"google.golang.org/protobuf/proto"
)
