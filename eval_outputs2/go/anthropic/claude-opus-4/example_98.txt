Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD (current branch) is using the older grpc-gateway v1 imports and includes some protobuf-related imports
- The incoming branch is using the newer grpc-gateway v2 imports but doesn't include the protobuf imports

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. The incoming branch wants to upgrade to grpc-gateway v2
2. The HEAD branch has added protobuf descriptor and proto imports that are likely still needed

The most sensible resolution would be to use the v2 imports from the incoming branch while keeping the protobuf imports from HEAD, as they serve different purposes and are both likely needed.

```go
import (
	"context"
	"io"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/golang/protobuf/descriptor"
	"github.com/golang/protobuf/proto"
	"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime"
	"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/utilities"
	"google.golang.org/grpc"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/grpclog"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/metadata"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/status"
