Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same `bindataFileInfo` for a locale file, but with different values:

- HEAD: size: 53114, mode: 438 (octal 0666), modTime: 1482291217 (Dec 2016)
- Other branch: size: 53381, mode: 420 (octal 0644), modTime: 1472745172 (Sep 2016)

The HEAD branch appears to have a newer timestamp but smaller file size, while the other branch has an older timestamp with a larger file size. This suggests the HEAD branch might have some content removed or optimized.

Since the HEAD branch has the more recent modification time (December 2016 vs September 2016), and this appears to be auto-generated asset data (likely from a build process), the most semantically correct resolution would be to use the HEAD version which represents the latest state of the locale file.

```go
	bytes, err := confLocaleLocale_zhTwIniBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/locale/locale_zh-TW.ini", size: 53114, mode: os.FileMode(438), modTime: time.Unix(1482291217, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info:  info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confReadmeDefault = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x52\x56\xa8\xf6\x4b\xcc\x4d\xad\xe5\xe2\xaa\x76\x49\x2d\x4e\x2e\xca\x2c\x28\xc9\xcc\xcf\xab\x05\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x92\x34\x40\x88\x17\x00\x00\x00")
