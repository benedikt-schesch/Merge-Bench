Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line that creates a `bindataFileInfo` struct. The only differences between the two versions are:

1. The `modTime` timestamp value (1444419364 vs 1467390283)
2. Minor spacing difference after `info:` in the struct initialization

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a go-bindata or similar tool), the timestamp difference represents when the asset was last modified. The newer timestamp (1467390283) from the second branch is more recent than the HEAD timestamp (1444419364).

The semantic intent of both changes is the same - to update the asset information. The most logical resolution is to keep the more recent timestamp while maintaining consistent formatting.

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreIpythonnotebookBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/IPythonNotebook", size: 37, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreIdris = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xd2\xcb\x4c\x4a\xe6\xd2\xd2\xcb\xe7\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x91\x9b\x77\x19\x0a\x00\x00\x00")
