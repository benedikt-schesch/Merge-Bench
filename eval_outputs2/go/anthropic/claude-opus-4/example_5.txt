Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch) is adding a field `esc string` to what appears to be a struct (likely `EventMouse` based on the method below)
- The incoming branch (a221f2faf4f9a059c8eba8f91c5d0dbd9845a985) does not have this field

Since the HEAD branch is actively adding a new field while the other branch simply doesn't have it, the intent seems clear: the current branch wants to extend the struct with an `esc` field (possibly for escape sequence handling in mouse events).

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	btn    ButtonMask
	mod    ModMask
	motion bool
	x      int
	y      int
	esc    string
}

// When returns the time when this EventMouse was created.
func (ev *EventMouse) When() time.Time {
	return ev.t

```
