Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides of the merge are trying to update the same line but with different values:

- HEAD has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- The incoming change has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The only difference between the two versions is:
1. The `modTime` timestamp value (1444419364 vs 1467390283)
2. Minor formatting: HEAD has two spaces after `info:` while the incoming change has one space

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a bindata tool) and the conflict is only about timestamps, the semantic intent is to update the modification time of the embedded asset. The newer timestamp (1467390283) from the incoming change is later than the HEAD timestamp (1444419364), so it makes sense to keep the newer timestamp.

I'll resolve this by taking the incoming change with the newer timestamp and consistent spacing:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreIgorproBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/IGORPro", size: 121, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreIpythonnotebook = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x52\x56\x08\x49\xcd\x2d\xc8\x2f\x4a\x2c\xaa\x54\x48\x49\x2c\x49\xe4\xd2\xcb\x2c\xa8\xcc\x4b\x8a\x4f\xce\x48\x4d\xce\x2e\xc8\xcf\xcc\x2b\x29\xd6\xe7\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x05\xae\x85\xc7\x25\x00\x00\x00")
