Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the type of the `output` field in a test struct. The conflict appears to be about using the correct import path/type name for the protobuf timestamp type.

Both sides have the same intent - to use a protobuf Timestamp type. The difference is:
- HEAD uses `timestamp.Timestamp`
- The other branch uses `timestamppb.Timestamp`

The `timestamppb` package name is the more modern convention for protobuf timestamp types in Go (following the pattern of adding 'pb' suffix to protobuf packages). This suggests the incoming change is updating to use the newer import convention.

Here's the resolved code:

```go

func TestConvertTimestamp(t *testing.T) {
	specs := []struct {
		name    string
		input   string
		output  *timestamppb.Timestamp
		wanterr bool
	}{
		{
			name:  "a valid RFC3339 timestamp",
			input: `"2016-05-10T10:19:13.123Z"`,

```
