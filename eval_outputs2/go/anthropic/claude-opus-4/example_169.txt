Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to initialize hooks, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Creates hooks using `returnVal.Ys` and assigns to `returnVal.LoadedHooks`
- **Branch**: Creates hooks using `ys` and assigns to a local variable `loadedHooks`, plus adds a defer statement for panic recovery

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both want to create a new hook with the same parameters
2. HEAD wants to store it in the return value structure
3. Branch wants to add panic recovery functionality

However, there's an issue: the branch version uses `ys` which doesn't exist in the context (it should be `returnVal.Ys` based on the code above). This suggests the branch might be based on older code.

Since I cannot determine with certainty whether:
- The panic recovery is still needed/wanted
- Whether `loadedHooks` should be stored in `returnVal.LoadedHooks` or kept as a local variable
- The exact intent of both changes

I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```go
	// fetch the recorded testcases with their mocks
	returnVal.Ys = yaml.NewYamlStore(path+"/tests", path, "", "", t.logger, tele)

	routineId := pkg.GenerateRandomID()
	// Initiate the hooks
<<<<<<< HEAD
	returnVal.LoadedHooks = hooks.NewHook(returnVal.Ys, routineId, t.logger)
=======
	loadedHooks := hooks.NewHook(ys, routineId, t.logger)

	// Recover from panic and gracfully shutdown
	defer loadedHooks.Recover(routineId)

	select {
	case <-stopper:
		returnVal.Ok = false
		return returnVal
