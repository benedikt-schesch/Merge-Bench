Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same `bindataFileInfo` struct initialization, but with different values:

- **HEAD**: Uses `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- **Incoming change**: Uses `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The only differences between the two versions are:
1. The `modTime` timestamp value
2. A minor formatting difference (two spaces vs one space before `info` in the `&asset` initialization)

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a tool that embeds files into Go binaries), and the incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 > 1444419364), the semantic intent seems to be updating to the latest version of the embedded file.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreVvvvBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/VVVV", size: 57, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreVagrant = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\x2b\x4b\x4c\x2f\x4a\xcc\x2b\xd1\xe7\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\xfc\x50\x87\xfb\x0a\x00\x00\x00")
