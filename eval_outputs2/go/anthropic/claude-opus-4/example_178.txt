Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to import the same package `"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/x/bsonx/bsoncore"`. The only difference is:
- HEAD: single import without parentheses
- Other branch: import with parentheses (typically used for multiple imports)

Since both sides want the same import and there's currently only one import needed, the semantic intent is clear. I'll resolve by using the simpler single import syntax from HEAD:

```go
package mongoparser

import "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/x/bsonx/bsoncore"

type Command string

const (
	Unknown           Command = "unknown"

```
