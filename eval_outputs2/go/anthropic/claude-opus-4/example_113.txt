Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the only difference between the two versions is the presence or absence of a blank line after `protoReq.Name, err = runtime.String(val)`.

The HEAD version has a blank line, while the incoming version (0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6) does not. Since this is merely a formatting difference with no semantic impact, and both versions are functionally identical, I'll resolve this by keeping the version without the blank line for consistency with the compact style of the rest of the code block.

```go
	if !ok {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "missing parameter %s", "name")
	}

	protoReq.Name, err = runtime.String(val)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "type mismatch, parameter: %s, error: %v", "name", err)
	}

	if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {

```
