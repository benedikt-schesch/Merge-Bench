Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to implement a `Del` method that removes a key from metadata, but they have different approaches:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Uses `NiceMD` type and converts the key to lowercase with `strings.ToLower(key)`
- **Right side**: Uses `MD` type and uses an `encodeKeyValue` function to process the key

The semantic intent of both sides is to safely delete a key from the metadata map. The key difference is in how they handle the key normalization - one uses simple lowercase conversion while the other uses a more sophisticated encoding function.

Given that the right side uses `encodeKeyValue` which appears to be a more robust approach (especially considering the comment about being "binary-key safe"), and it's handling the encoding properly, I'll resolve in favor of the right side's approach while keeping the type name from HEAD:

```go
//
// It works analogously to http.Header.Del, deleting all values if they exist.
//
// The function is binary-key safe.

func (m NiceMD) Del(key string) NiceMD {
	k, _ := encodeKeyValue(key, "")
	delete(m, k)
	return m
}

// Set sets the given value in a metadata.

```
