Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line with different `modTime` values for a `bindataFileInfo` struct. The only difference between the two versions is:

- HEAD has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- The incoming change has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

Additionally, there's a minor formatting difference where the incoming change has one less space before `info` in the `a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}` line.

Since this appears to be generated code (likely from a tool like go-bindata) that embeds file metadata, and the newer timestamp (1467390283) is from the incoming change, it makes sense to accept the incoming change as it represents the more recent version of the embedded file.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreLabviewBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/LabVIEW", size: 142, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreLaravel = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\x4f\xca\xcf\x2f\x29\x2e\x29\x4a\x2c\xd0\x4f\xce\xcf\x2d\xc8\xcc\x49\x4d\xd1\x2b\xc8\x28\xe0\xd2\x4b\xcd\x2b\xd3\xd3\x42\x30\x61\x0c\x2e\x40\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\xab\x96\x52\xb8\x31\x00\x00\x00")
```
