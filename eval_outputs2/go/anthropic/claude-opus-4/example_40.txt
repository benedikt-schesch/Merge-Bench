Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line with slightly different values:

1. **HEAD** has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
2. **Incoming change** has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The only difference between the two versions is:
- The `modTime` timestamp value (1444419364 vs 1467390283)
- A minor formatting difference (two spaces vs one space after `info:`)

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a bindata tool) that embeds file information, the semantic intent is to update the modification time of the embedded asset. The incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 is later than 1444419364), which likely represents a more recent update to the source file.

The formatting difference is minor, but we should preserve the single space format from the incoming change as it appears to be the intended formatting.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreExtjsBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/ExtJs", size: 38, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreFancy = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xd2\x2b\x4a\x4a\xe6\xd2\xd2\x4b\xab\x4c\xe6\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\xf9\xc8\xaa\x14\x0c\x00\x00\x00")
