Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define a method for the `tester` type, but with different signatures and purposes:

- HEAD side: `InitialiseTest` method that takes a `TestConfig` and returns `InitialiseTestReturn` and an error
- Other side: `Test` method that takes multiple string parameters and options, returning a bool

The conflict appears to be about which method should exist at this point in the code. Both methods seem to have different purposes - one for initialization and one for running tests. Without more context about the intended architecture, I cannot determine which one should be kept or if both should exist.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```go
		logger: logger,
		mutex:  sync.Mutex{},
	}
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
func (t *tester) InitialiseTest(cfg *TestConfig) (InitialiseTestReturn, error) {
	var returnVal InitialiseTestReturn
=======
func (t *tester) Test(path, testReportPath string, appCmd string, options TestOptions) bool {

	var ps *proxy.ProxySet
>>>>>>> e4e1eb9b70ad7642e1296bc79aeecc4953e607c9

	stopper := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(stopper, os.Interrupt, os.Kill, syscall.SIGHUP, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGQUIT, syscall.SIGTERM, syscall.SIGKILL)

	models.SetMode(models.MODE_TEST)

```
