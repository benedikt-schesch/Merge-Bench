Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the `modTime` field in the `bindataFileInfo` struct, but they have different timestamp values:

- HEAD has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- The incoming change has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The only other difference is the spacing after `info:` - HEAD has two spaces while the incoming change has one space.

Since this appears to be generated code (likely from a tool like go-bindata) that embeds file metadata, the semantic intent of both changes is to update the modification time of the embedded file. The incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), which likely represents a more recent update to the source file.

Here's the resolved version, taking the more recent timestamp and maintaining consistent spacing:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreEiffelstudioBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/EiffelStudio", size: 35, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreElisp = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x52\x56\x70\xce\xcf\x2d\xc8\xcc\x49\x4d\xe1\xd2\xd2\x4b\xcd\x49\xe6\xe2\x52\x56\x08\x48\x4c\xce\x4e\x4c\xcf\xcc\x4b\xe7\xd2\x4b\x4e\x2c\xce\xe6\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x9c\x93\x49\x5c\x24\x00\x00\x00")
```
