Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the code that builds for iOS architectures. Let me analyze the intent:

- **HEAD side**: Adds support for cross-compilation by conditionally appending a cross-compile PATH environment variable (`cenv[arch]`) to the environment
- **5c0e7e404 side**: Modifies the `goIOSBindArchive` function call to include an additional parameter - a source directory path (`filepath.Join(tmpdir, "src")`)

Both changes appear to be independent improvements that should be combined. The semantic intent is:
1. Support cross-compilation environments (HEAD)
2. Pass the source directory to the bind archive function (other branch)

Here's the resolved conflict that preserves both intents:

```go
	for _, arch := range archs {
		env := darwinEnv[arch]
		// Add the generated packages to GOPATH for reverse bindings.
		gopath := fmt.Sprintf("GOPATH=%s%c%s", tmpdir, filepath.ListSeparator, goEnv("GOPATH"))
		env = append(env, gopath)
		if cenv[arch] != "" {
			env = append(env, cenv[arch]) // Add the Cross Compile PATH Env
		}

		path, err := goIOSBindArchive(name, env, filepath.Join(tmpdir, "src"))
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("darwin-%s: %v", arch, err)
		}
		cmd.Args = append(cmd.Args, "-arch", archClang(arch), path)
