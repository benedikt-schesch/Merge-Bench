Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve a module restructuring/migration:

- **HEAD**: Using the v1 path structure with `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway/descriptor/types.go` and the older `github.com/golang/protobuf` import
- **Incoming change**: Using the v2 path structure with `internal/descriptor/types.go` and the newer `google.golang.org/protobuf` imports

The semantic intent is clearly to migrate from v1 to v2 of the grpc-gateway module and from the deprecated `github.com/golang/protobuf` to the newer `google.golang.org/protobuf`. The incoming change represents the desired end state.

Here's the resolved code:

```go

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"

	"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/internal/casing"
	"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/internal/httprule"
	"google.golang.org/protobuf/types/descriptorpb"
	"google.golang.org/protobuf/types/pluginpb"
)

// IsWellKnownType returns true if the provided fully qualified type name is considered 'well-known'.
func IsWellKnownType(typeName string) bool {
	_, ok := wellKnownTypeConv[typeName]

```
