Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's in a generated Go file from protobuf. The conflict is about version information comments.

The HEAD side has no version information, while the incoming change adds version information for both protoc-gen-go and protoc.

Since this is generated code and the incoming change provides useful version information without removing anything, the semantic intent is to document which versions of the tools were used to generate this file. This is valuable metadata that should be preserved.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
// Code generated by protoc-gen-go. DO NOT EDIT.
// versions:
// 	protoc-gen-go v1.25.0
// 	protoc        v3.12.0
// source: examples/internal/helloworld/helloworld.proto

package helloworld

import (

```
