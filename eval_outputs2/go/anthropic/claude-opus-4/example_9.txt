Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to configure terminal input behavior by setting VMIN and VTIME parameters, while the other branch has removed these lines entirely.

The semantic intent here appears to be:
- HEAD wants to configure the terminal to wake up when at least 1 byte arrives (VMIN=1) with no timeout (VTIME=0)
- The other branch seems to have decided these settings are not needed or should be handled elsewhere

Without more context about why the other branch removed these lines, I cannot determine which approach is correct. The conflict represents a fundamental disagreement about whether these terminal parameters should be set here.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```go
	newtios.Lflag &^= syscall.ECHO | syscall.ECHONL | syscall.ICANON |
		syscall.ISIG | syscall.IEXTEN
	newtios.Cflag &^= syscall.CSIZE | syscall.PARENB
	newtios.Cflag |= syscall.CS8

<<<<<<< HEAD
	// We wake up only when at least 1 byte has arrived
	newtios.Cc[syscall.VMIN] = 1
	newtios.Cc[syscall.VTIME] = 0

	tios = uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&newtios))

	ioc = uintptr(syscall.TIOCSETA)
	if _, _, e1 := syscall.Syscall6(syscall.SYS_IOCTL, fd, ioc, tios, 0, 0, 0); e1 != 0 {
		e = e1
```
