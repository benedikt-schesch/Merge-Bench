Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch (current branch) has an additional import reference `var _ = descriptor.ForMessage` that the other branch doesn't have.

This appears to be a case where one branch added a new import reference while the other branch didn't. These underscore assignments are typically used to ensure packages are imported even if not directly used in the code (often for side effects or to satisfy interface requirements).

Since the conflict is simply about whether to include this additional import reference, and there's no semantic conflict between the two versions, the safest resolution is to keep the additional import from HEAD. This follows the principle of preserving additions unless there's a specific reason to remove them.

```go
var _ codes.Code
var _ io.Reader
var _ status.Status
var _ = runtime.String
var _ = utilities.NewDoubleArray
var _ = descriptor.ForMessage
var _ = metadata.Join

var (
	filter_UnannotatedEchoService_Echo_0 = &utilities.DoubleArray{Encoding: map[string]int{"id": 0}, Base: []int{1, 1, 0}, Check: []int{0, 1, 2}}
)
