Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD branch is defining a type alias `Empty = emptypb.Empty`
2. The incoming branch (84668698...) is adding a compile-time assertion comment and constant to ensure proto package version compatibility

These changes appear to be addressing different concerns and both are likely needed:
- The type alias provides a convenient way to reference the Empty type
- The version check ensures compatibility with the proto package

Since these changes don't semantically conflict with each other, both should be included in the final result.

```go
	reflect "reflect"
)

// Symbols defined in public import of google/protobuf/empty.proto.

type Empty = emptypb.Empty

// This is a compile-time assertion to ensure that this generated file
// is compatible with the proto package it is being compiled against.
// A compilation error at this line likely means your copy of the
// proto package needs to be updated.
const _ = proto.ProtoPackageIsVersion3 // please upgrade the proto package
