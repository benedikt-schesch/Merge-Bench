Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to create a `bindataFileInfo` struct with identical parameters except for the `modTime` field. The conflict appears to be related to different timestamps for the same file.

Both sides have:
- Same name: `"conf/gitignore/LibreOffice"`
- Same size: `30`
- Same mode: `os.FileMode(420)`
- Different modTime: HEAD has `time.Unix(1444419364, 0)` while the other branch has `time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

Additionally, there's a minor formatting difference in the spacing after `info:` - HEAD has two spaces while the other branch has one space.

Since this appears to be generated code (likely from a tool like go-bindata), and the only semantic difference is the timestamp, I'll resolve this by taking the newer timestamp (1467390283 is later than 1444419364) and using consistent formatting with one space after the colon.

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreLibreofficeBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/LibreOffice", size: 30, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreLilypond = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xd2\x2b\x48\x49\xe3\x02\x92\xc5\x40\x22\x37\x33\x25\x13\x42\x01\xc9\x9c\xfc\x74\x2e\xad\x3a\x2e\x40\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\x80\x9a\xc4\xa4\x21\x00\x00\x00")
