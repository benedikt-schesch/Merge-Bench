Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- The HEAD branch has commented out the httpparser import
- The incoming branch (7dea42d7b9709f2c68032e56d8d67995336c9378) has httpparser uncommented and also adds mongoparser and mysqlparser imports

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD intentionally commented out httpparser (possibly due to some issue or temporary disabling)
- The incoming branch wants to add parser support for multiple databases (http, mongo, mysql)

Since the HEAD branch explicitly commented out httpparser rather than removing it, this suggests there might be a reason to keep it disabled. The safest resolution is to keep httpparser commented but add the new parsers:

```go

	"github.com/miekg/dns"
	"go.keploy.io/server/pkg/hooks"
	"go.keploy.io/server/pkg/models"
	genericparser "go.keploy.io/server/pkg/proxy/integrations/genericParser"
	// "go.keploy.io/server/pkg/proxy/integrations/httpparser"
	"go.keploy.io/server/pkg/proxy/integrations/mongoparser"
	"go.keploy.io/server/pkg/proxy/integrations/mysqlparser"
	"go.keploy.io/server/pkg/proxy/util"
	"go.uber.org/zap"

	"time"
)
