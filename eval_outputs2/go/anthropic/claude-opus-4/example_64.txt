I need to analyze this merge conflict. Looking at the conflict, I can see:

1. The first conflict marker shows `>>>>>>> 84668698ea25b64748563aa20726db66a6b8d299` at the beginning, which seems to be a formatting error in the provided snippet.
2. There are two actual conflicts in the deprecation comments:
   - HEAD version: `// Deprecated: Do not use.`
   - Other version: `// Deprecated: do not use.`

The only difference is the capitalization of "Do" vs "do". Both sides have the same semantic intent - marking the function as deprecated. This is a trivial stylistic difference.

Looking at Go conventions and common deprecation comment patterns, both styles are used, but "Do not use" (with capital D) is more commonly seen in official Go documentation and follows standard sentence capitalization rules for comments.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```go
func UnmarshalMessageSet([]byte, interface{}) error {
	return errors.New("proto: not implemented")
}

// Deprecated: Do not use.
func MarshalMessageSetJSON(interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
	return nil, errors.New("proto: not implemented")
}


```
