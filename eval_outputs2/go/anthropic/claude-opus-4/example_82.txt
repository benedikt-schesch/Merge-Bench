Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD branch (recovery/interceptors_test.go) has some variable declarations for test ping requests
2. The other branch (5ca0c417820d989b27ce8f2ef107c8ca878f3561:interceptors/recovery/interceptors_test.go) has removed these variables
3. The file appears to have been moved/renamed between branches (from `recovery/interceptors_test.go` to `interceptors/recovery/interceptors_test.go`)

Based on the context, these appear to be test variables used for recovery testing (note the names: `goodPing`, `panicPing`, `nilPanicPing`). The semantic intent seems to be setting up test cases for a recovery interceptor.

Since this is a test file and these variables appear to be test fixtures that would likely be used by the `recoveryAssertService` or other test functions, I'll preserve them in the merge resolution:

```go
	"google.golang.org/grpc"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/status"
)

var (
	goodPing     = &pb_testproto.PingRequest{Value: "something", SleepTimeMs: 9999}
	panicPing    = &pb_testproto.PingRequest{Value: "panic", SleepTimeMs: 9999}
	nilPanicPing = &pb_testproto.PingRequest{Value: "nilpanic", SleepTimeMs: 9999}
)

type recoveryAssertService struct {
	testpb.TestServiceServer
}

func (s *recoveryAssertService) Ping(ctx context.Context, ping *testpb.PingRequest) (*testpb.PingResponse, error) {

```
