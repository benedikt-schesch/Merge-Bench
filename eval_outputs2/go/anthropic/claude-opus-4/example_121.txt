Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the only difference between the two sides is the presence or absence of a blank line after the `protoReq.Parent, err = runtime.String(val)` assignment.

The HEAD version has a blank line, while the incoming change (0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6) removes it. This appears to be a formatting/style difference rather than a semantic change.

Given that both sides have the same functional code and the only difference is whitespace, I'll resolve this by choosing the version without the extra blank line, as it provides more compact code without affecting functionality.

```go
	if !ok {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "missing parameter %s", "parent")
	}

	protoReq.Parent, err = runtime.String(val)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "type mismatch, parameter: %s, error: %v", "parent", err)
	}

	if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {

```
