Looking at this merge conflict, I need to determine which version number is correct. The conflict is between:
- HEAD: VERSION = "2.4.2"
- Other branch: VERSION = "2.4.1"

Since version numbers typically increment, and 2.4.2 is higher than 2.4.1, the HEAD version (2.4.2) appears to be the more recent version. The semantic intent seems to be updating the version number, so I'll resolve in favor of the higher version number.

```go

	"github.com/fatih/color"
)

const (
	VERSION = "2.4.2"
)

func putAsciiArt(s string) {
	for _, c := range s {
		d := string(c)

```
