Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) includes an import reference for `descriptor.ForMessage` while the other side has removed it. 

Since this appears to be in a generated gRPC gateway file (based on the context with `utilities.DoubleArray`, `codes.Code`, etc.), and the conflict is about whether to include the `descriptor.ForMessage` import reference, I need to consider which is correct.

Given that the other side explicitly removed this line, and there's no usage of `descriptor.ForMessage` visible in the surrounding code context, it seems the intent is to remove this unused import reference.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```go
var _ codes.Code
var _ io.Reader
var _ status.Status
var _ = runtime.String
var _ = utilities.NewDoubleArray
var _ = metadata.Join

var (
	filter_EchoService_Echo_0 = &utilities.DoubleArray{Encoding: map[string]int{"id": 0}, Base: []int{1, 1, 0}, Check: []int{0, 1, 2}}
)

```
