Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the `Descriptor` method implementation, but with different approaches:

- The HEAD (left side) is using `fileDescriptor_fd8fde893e1fcf9f` - which appears to be an older style of referencing the file descriptor
- The incoming change (right side) is using `file_examples_internal_helloworld_helloworld_proto_rawDescGZIP()` - which appears to be a newer style that includes the full path in the function name

Based on the semantic intent, both sides want to return the file descriptor for the proto file, but the right side appears to be using a more modern/updated approach that includes the full path context. This is likely from a protobuf compiler update.

Here's the resolved conflict, accepting the newer approach:

```go
	return mi.MessageOf(x)
}

// Deprecated: Use HelloReply.ProtoReflect.Descriptor instead.
func (*HelloReply) Descriptor() ([]byte, []int) {
	return file_examples_internal_helloworld_helloworld_proto_rawDescGZIP(), []int{1}
}

func (x *HelloReply) GetMessage() string {
	if x != nil {
		return x.Message
```
