Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch): Has the basic imports including `fmt`
- Incoming change (84668698...): Adds `log` import in addition to `fmt`

Since the incoming change is adding an additional import (`log`) that doesn't conflict with the existing imports, the semantic intent appears to be to include both `fmt` and `log` packages. This is a common pattern where one branch adds functionality that requires logging.

Here's the resolved version:

```go

package proto

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"reflect"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
	"sync"


```
