Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are calling `runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext` but with different numbers of arguments:

- HEAD version: 3 arguments - `(ctx, mux, req)`
- Incoming version: 4 arguments - `(ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello")`

The incoming version adds a fourth parameter which appears to be the full gRPC method path. This suggests that the API for `runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext` has been updated to require the method path as an additional parameter, likely for better request routing or logging purposes.

Since this appears to be an API change where the additional parameter provides useful context (the specific gRPC method being called), the resolution should use the incoming version with 4 arguments:

```go
		ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(req.Context())
		defer cancel()
		var stream runtime.ServerTransportStream
		ctx = grpc.NewContextWithServerTransportStream(ctx, &stream)
		inboundMarshaler, outboundMarshaler := runtime.MarshalerForRequest(mux, req)
		rctx, err := runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext(ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello")
		if err != nil {
			runtime.HTTPError(ctx, mux, outboundMarshaler, w, req, err)
			return
		}
		resp, md, err := local_request_Greeter_SayHello_0(rctx, inboundMarshaler, server, req, pathParams)
```
