Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to create the same `bindataFileInfo` struct with identical field values except for the `modTime` field:

- HEAD has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- The other branch has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The only other difference is a minor formatting difference in the spacing after `info:` in the asset struct initialization.

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a tool like go-bindata) that embeds file information, the semantic intent of both sides is the same - to update the file information for "conf/gitignore/CraftCMS". The different timestamps likely represent when the file was regenerated on each branch.

In this case, I'll choose the more recent timestamp (1467390283 is later than 1444419364) as it likely represents the most up-to-date version of the file.

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreCraftcmsBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/CraftCMS", size: 120, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreDm = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xd2\x4b\xc9\x4d\xe2\xd2\xd2\x2b\x2a\x4e\x06\x92\x99\x79\x25\x40\x32\x27\x1b\x48\x54\x65\x16\x70\x01\x02\x00\x00\xff\xff\x1b\x86\x0d\x57\x1d\x00\x00\x00")
