Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same `bindataFileInfo` struct initialization, with two differences:

1. The `modTime` field has different Unix timestamps:
   - HEAD: `1444419364`
   - Incoming: `1467390283`

2. There's a minor formatting difference in the spacing after `info:` 
   - HEAD: `info:  info` (two spaces)
   - Incoming: `info: info` (one space)

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a tool that embeds files as Go code), the semantic intent is to update the file metadata to reflect the most recent version. The incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), which suggests it represents a newer version of the embedded file.

The formatting difference is minor, but the single space after the colon is more consistent with standard Go formatting conventions.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreNimBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Nim", size: 10, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreNinja = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xcb\xcb\xcc\xcb\x4a\x8c\x4f\x49\x2d\x28\xe6\x82\xb2\x73\xf2\xd3\xb9\x00\x01\x00\x00\xff\xff\xee\x9e\xc8\x72\x17\x00\x00\x00")
