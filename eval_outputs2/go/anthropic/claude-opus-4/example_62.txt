Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - adding a deprecation comment to the `MarshalMessageSet` function. The only difference is the capitalization of "Do" vs "do" in the comment.

Since the existing deprecation comment for `GetStats()` uses "Do not use." with a capital "D", it would be more consistent to use the same capitalization throughout the file.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
type Stats struct{ Emalloc, Dmalloc, Encode, Decode, Chit, Cmiss, Size uint64 }

// Deprecated: Do not use.
func GetStats() Stats { return Stats{} }

// Deprecated: Do not use.
func MarshalMessageSet(interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
	return nil, errors.New("proto: not implemented")
}

```
