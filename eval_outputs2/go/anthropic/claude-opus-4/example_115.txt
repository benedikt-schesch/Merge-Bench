Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the only difference between the two versions is that HEAD has an extra blank line after the `runtime.FloatValue(val)` assignment, while the other branch doesn't have this blank line.

Since this is purely a formatting difference with no semantic changes, and both versions are functionally identical, I'll resolve this by keeping the version without the extra blank line for consistency:

```go
	if !ok {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "missing parameter %s", "floatVal")
	}

	protoReq.FloatVal, err = runtime.FloatValue(val)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "type mismatch, parameter: %s, error: %v", "floatVal", err)
	}

	if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {

```
