Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line of code that creates a `bindataFileInfo` struct. The only difference between the two versions is the `modTime` field:

- HEAD has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- The incoming change has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

Additionally, there's a minor spacing difference in the `a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}` line where the incoming change has one space after `info:` while HEAD has two spaces.

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a tool that embeds files as Go code), and the only semantic difference is the modification timestamp, I should take the more recent timestamp. The timestamp `1467390283` (July 1, 2016) is more recent than `1444419364` (October 9, 2015).

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreMavenBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Maven", size: 170, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreMercurial = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xcb\x48\xd7\xe7\x02\x12\x99\xe9\x79\xf9\x45\xa9\x20\x56\x71\x66\x7a\x31\x98\x2e\x4d\x82\x52\xc5\x25\x89\x25\x60\xa9\x92\x44\xa0\x14\x20\x00\x00\xff\xff\x5c\x2f\x20\x72\x32\x00\x00\x00")
