Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar functionality but with different approaches:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Uses `NiceMD` type and simply converts the key to lowercase using `strings.ToLower(key)`
- **Right side**: Uses `MD` type and calls `encodeKeyValue(key, "")` to process the key

The key difference is in how they handle the key transformation. The comment mentions "The function is binary-key safe", which suggests that the `encodeKeyValue` approach from the right side is likely the correct way to ensure binary-key safety, rather than just converting to lowercase.

Given that both sides are trying to implement a `Get` method that retrieves values from metadata, and considering the binary-key safety requirement mentioned in the comments, the semantic intent appears to be to use the more robust `encodeKeyValue` approach.

Here's the resolved version:

```go
//
// It works analogously to http.Header.Get, returning the first value if there are many set. If the value is not set,
// an empty string is returned.
//
// The function is binary-key safe.
func (m MD) Get(key string) string {
	k, _ := encodeKeyValue(key, "")
	vv, ok := m[k]
	if !ok {
		return ""
	}
	return vv[0]
}
```
