Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import protobuf-related packages but with different import paths and aliases:

- HEAD imports `pb2 "github.com/golang/protobuf/internal/testprotos/proto2_proto"`
- The other branch imports `pb "github.com/golang/protobuf/proto/test_proto"`

Based on the test function name `TestGetExtensionsWithMissingExtensions` and the fact that the code uses `pb2.MyMessage` and `pb2.Ext`, it appears the HEAD version is the correct one to keep, as it's using the `pb2` alias that matches the code usage below.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```go
	"strings"
	"sync"
	"testing"

	"github.com/golang/protobuf/proto"

	pb2 "github.com/golang/protobuf/internal/testprotos/proto2_proto"
)

func TestGetExtensionsWithMissingExtensions(t *testing.T) {
	msg := &pb2.MyMessage{}
	ext1 := &pb2.Ext{}

```
