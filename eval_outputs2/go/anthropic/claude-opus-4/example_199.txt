Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import packages from the same project (`github.com/oam-dev/terraform-controller`) but different parts of it:

- HEAD wants to import `v1beta1` from the api package
- The incoming change wants to import `types` from `api/types/crossplane-runtime`

Based on the semantic intent, both imports appear to be needed as they're importing different things from the terraform-controller project. The conflict seems to be a result of both sides adding imports in the same location rather than a true semantic conflict.

Here's the resolved version that includes both imports:

```go
package common

import (
	"encoding/json"

	"github.com/oam-dev/terraform-controller/api/v1beta1"
	types "github.com/oam-dev/terraform-controller/api/types/crossplane-runtime"

	corev1 "k8s.io/api/core/v1"
	metav1 "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1"
	"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime"

	"github.com/oam-dev/kubevela/apis/core.oam.dev/condition"

```
