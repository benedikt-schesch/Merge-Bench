Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add imports after `"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/yaml"`. The HEAD version adds nothing, while the other branch adds a blank line and imports `"sigs.k8s.io/krew/pkg/constants"`.

Since the conflict is about adding an import that one branch needs while the other doesn't, and there's already an import from the same module (`"sigs.k8s.io/krew/pkg/index"`), the semantic intent is to include the constants package import. This is a common pattern where one branch adds functionality that requires additional imports.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	"strings"

	"github.com/golang/glog"
	"github.com/pkg/errors"
	"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/yaml"

	"sigs.k8s.io/krew/pkg/constants"
	"sigs.k8s.io/krew/pkg/index"
)

// LoadPluginListFromFS will parse and retrieve all plugin files.
func LoadPluginListFromFS(indexDir string) ([]index.Plugin, error) {

```
