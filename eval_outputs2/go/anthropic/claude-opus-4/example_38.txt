Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line of code that creates a `bindataFileInfo` struct. The differences are:

1. **HEAD**: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)` with spacing `info: info`
2. **Incoming change**: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)` with spacing `info:  info` (extra space)

The semantic intent appears to be updating the modification timestamp. The incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), which likely represents a newer version of the file.

The spacing difference in `info: info` vs `info:  info` appears to be a formatting inconsistency. Looking at the HEAD version, it uses single spacing consistently.

Here's the resolved conflict, taking the newer timestamp but maintaining consistent spacing:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreErlangBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Erlang", size: 95, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreEspresso = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xd2\x4b\x2d\x2e\x28\xca\xcf\xe2\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x2c\x1e\xba\x4d\x09\x00\x00\x00")
