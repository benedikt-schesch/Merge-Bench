Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same `bindataFileInfo` struct initialization, with the only differences being:

1. The `modTime` field: HEAD has `time.Unix(1444419364, 0)` while the incoming change has `time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`
2. Minor spacing difference: HEAD has two spaces between `info:` and `info` while the incoming change has one space

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a tool like go-bindata based on the function names and structure), and the incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), the semantic intent is to update to the latest version of the embedded file.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreFinaleBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Finale", size: 184, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreFlexbuilder = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x4a\xca\xcc\xd3\xe7\x02\x12\xba\x29\xa9\x49\xa5\xe9\x10\x66\x51\x6a\x4e\x6a\x62\x71\xaa\x3e\x17\x20\x00\x00\xff\xff\xd4\x34\xbc\x13\x1d\x00\x00\x00")
