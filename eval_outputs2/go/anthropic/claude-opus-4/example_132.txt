Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch): Uses `UpdateMaskPaths`
- Incoming change: Uses `UpdateMask`

This appears to be a naming convention conflict for what seems to be the same field. Without more context about the codebase conventions or the specific API being implemented, I cannot definitively determine which name is correct. The field appears to be related to partial updates (common in REST/gRPC APIs), but both names could be valid depending on the API specification.

Since the intent is ambiguous and I cannot determine which naming convention is correct without more context, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```go

@return interface{}
*/

type ABitOfEverythingServiceUpdateV2Opts struct { 
<<<<<<< HEAD
	UpdateMaskPaths optional.Interface
=======
	UpdateMask optional.Interface
>>>>>>> 0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6
}

func (a *ABitOfEverythingServiceApiService) ABitOfEverythingServiceUpdateV2(ctx context.Context, abeUuid string, body ExamplepbABitOfEverything, localVarOptionals *ABitOfEverythingServiceUpdateV2Opts) (interface{}, *http.Response, error) {
	var (
		localVarHttpMethod = strings.ToUpper("Put")
