Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to create the same `asset` structure, but with different timestamps in the `modTime` field.

The differences are:
- HEAD: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- Incoming: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The only other difference is minor spacing after `info:` in the struct initialization (HEAD has two spaces, incoming has one space).

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a tool like go-bindata based on the function names and structure), the timestamp difference likely reflects when the file was last regenerated. The incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364 when converted to dates).

In this case, I'll preserve the more recent timestamp and use the consistent single-space formatting from the incoming change:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreLinuxBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Linux", size: 118, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreLithium = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xca\xc9\x4c\x2a\x4a\x2c\xca\x4c\x2d\xd6\xd7\xe2\x2a\x4a\x2d\xce\x2f\x2d\x4a\x06\xb2\x4b\x72\x0b\x80\x7c\x40\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\x1a\xab\xaa\xaa\x1c\x00\x00\x00")
