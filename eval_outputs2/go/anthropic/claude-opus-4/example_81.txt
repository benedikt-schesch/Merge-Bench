Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import packages from the `grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware` project, but they represent different versions:

- HEAD is using the v1 API with the old import paths
- The other branch is using the v2 API with the new import paths under `/v2/`

Since the incoming change (5ca0c417) is moving to v2 of the middleware library, and this appears to be an intentional upgrade, I'll resolve this by accepting the v2 imports:

```go

import (
	"context"
	"testing"

	"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/interceptors/recovery"
	"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/testing/testpb"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"
	"google.golang.org/grpc"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/codes"

```
