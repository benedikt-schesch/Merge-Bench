Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line with different timestamps:

- HEAD (current branch): `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- Incoming branch: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The only difference between the two versions is:
1. The timestamp value (1444419364 vs 1467390283)
2. Minor spacing difference after `info:` (two spaces vs one space)

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a bindata tool that embeds files), and the incoming branch has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 is later than 1444419364), I'll resolve by taking the incoming change with its newer timestamp and consistent spacing:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreEmacsBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Emacs", size: 320, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreEnsime = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x52\x56\x70\xcd\x2b\xce\xcc\x4d\x55\x28\x2e\x48\x4d\xce\x4c\xcb\x4c\xe6\xd2\x4b\x05\x0b\xc0\xe8\xf8\xe4\xc4\xe4\x8c\x54\x7d\x38\x37\xa7\x34\x39\x35\x0f\xc8\x07\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x9d\x93\x9f\xe6\x39\x00\x00\x00")
