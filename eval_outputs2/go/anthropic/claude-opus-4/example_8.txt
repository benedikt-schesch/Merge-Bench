Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to set an `esc` field on the event object `ev`, while the other branch doesn't have this addition.

The conflict appears to be about whether to include the escape sequence information in the paste event. Since the HEAD branch is explicitly adding this functionality (storing the escape sequence in the event), and this seems like a deliberate enhancement to preserve more information about the paste event, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version.

```go
		// The bracketed paste has started
		if strings.HasSuffix(str, "\x1b[201~") {
			// The bracketed paste has ended
			// Strip out the start and end sequences
			ev := NewEventPaste(str[6 : len(b)-6])
			ev.esc = escseq
			t.PostEvent(ev)
			for i := 0; i < len(b); i++ {
				buf.ReadByte()
			}
			return true, true

```
