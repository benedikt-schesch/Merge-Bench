Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides of the merge are trying to update the same line of code that creates a `bindataFileInfo` struct. The only difference between the two versions is the `modTime` field:

- HEAD has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- The incoming change has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

Additionally, there's a minor formatting difference where the incoming change has a space before `info` in `a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}` while HEAD has two spaces.

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a tool like go-bindata) that embeds files, and the conflict is only about the modification timestamp, the semantic intent of both sides is the same - to update the embedded file metadata. The newer timestamp (1467390283) is from the incoming change, which is later than the HEAD timestamp (1444419364).

The resolution should use the newer timestamp and maintain consistent formatting:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreKdevelop4Bytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/KDevelop4", size: 16, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreKate = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x52\x56\x08\x2e\x4f\x2c\x50\x70\xcb\xcc\x49\x2d\x56\x50\xe6\xd2\xd3\xd2\xcb\x4e\x2c\x49\xd5\x2d\x2e\x2f\xe0\xd2\x03\x12\x7a\x5a\x5c\x80\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\xe9\xbe\x25\x0c\x22\x00\x00\x00")
