Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to build a list of detectors. The HEAD version has a GoDetector and then continues with PHP, Poetry, and Python detectors. The incoming change is adding a NodeJSDetector to the list.

The semantic intent is clear: both sides want to include their respective detectors in the list. The conflict is simply about whether to include the NodeJSDetector or not. Since the incoming change is adding functionality (a new detector) without removing anything, and this appears to be a list where multiple detectors can coexist, the resolution should include both the GoDetector and the NodeJSDetector.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
}

func detectors(path string) []detector.Detector {
	return []detector.Detector{
		&detector.GoDetector{Root: path},
		&detector.NodeJSDetector{Root: path},
		&detector.PHPDetector{Root: path},
		&detector.PoetryDetector{Root: path},
		&detector.PythonDetector{Root: path},
	}
}

```
