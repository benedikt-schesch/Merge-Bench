Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they both have the same condition `if r.warnOnUnboundMethods {`. The only difference is:

1. HEAD has an extra space after `if` and before `r.warnOnUnboundMethods`
2. The file paths are different (one is in `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway/descriptor/services.go`, the other in `internal/descriptor/services.go`)

Since the semantic intent is identical and the only difference is formatting (extra space), I'll resolve this by using the version without the extra space, which follows more standard Go formatting conventions.

```go
						return err
					}
					optsList = append(optsList, defaultOpts)
				} else {
					logFn := glog.V(1).Infof
					if r.warnOnUnboundMethods {
						logFn = glog.Warningf
					}
					logFn("No HttpRule found for method: %s.%s", svc.GetName(), md.GetName())
				}
			}

```
