Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call `setRootPath()`, but they differ in whether to pass an argument:

- HEAD (current branch): calls `setRootPath()` with no arguments
- The incoming change: calls `setRootPath(rootExecutionRelPath)` with an argument

Without seeing the function signature of `setRootPath()` or understanding the broader context of what `rootExecutionRelPath` represents, I cannot determine which version is semantically correct. The conflict appears to be a fundamental disagreement about whether `setRootPath()` should take a parameter or not.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```go

	viper.AutomaticEnv()
}

func initGitConfig() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
	setRootPath()
=======
	setRootPath(rootExecutionRelPath)
>>>>>>> 491b8436429d0457828901831e2c6c6d758a4d60
	setGitHooksPath(getHooksPathFromGitConfig())
}

func getRootPath() string {
	return rootPath

```
