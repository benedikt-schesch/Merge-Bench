Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the only difference between the two sides is the presence or absence of a blank line after the `runtime.UInt32Value(val)` assignment.

The HEAD version has a blank line, while the other branch (0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6) does not. This is a purely stylistic difference with no semantic impact.

Since both versions are functionally identical, I'll resolve this by choosing the version without the extra blank line for consistency with the rest of the code structure (where error checks immediately follow their corresponding operations without blank lines).

```go
	if !ok {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "missing parameter %s", "uint32Val")
	}

	protoReq.Uint32Val, err = runtime.UInt32Value(val)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "type mismatch, parameter: %s, error: %v", "uint32Val", err)
	}

	if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {

```
