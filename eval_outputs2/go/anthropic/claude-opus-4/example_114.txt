Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has an extra blank line after the `runtime.StringValue(val)` assignment, while the other branch doesn't have this blank line.

Since this is just a formatting difference with no semantic changes, and both sides have the same functional code, I'll resolve this by keeping the version without the extra blank line (the incoming change) as it maintains more consistent spacing in the code.

```go
	if !ok {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "missing parameter %s", "strVal")
	}

	protoReq.StrVal, err = runtime.StringValue(val)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "type mismatch, parameter: %s, error: %v", "strVal", err)
	}

	if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {

```
