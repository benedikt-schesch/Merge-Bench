Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - loading eBPF hooks into the kernel. The main differences are:

1. **HEAD**: Uses `returnVal.LoadedHooks` and passes `cfg.AppCmd`, `cfg.AppContainer`, and returns `returnVal, err`
2. **Incoming**: Uses `loadedHooks` and passes `appCmd`, `options.AppContainer`, and returns `false`

The semantic intent is clear - both want to load hooks with application command and container information. The HEAD version appears more complete as it:
- Properly returns the error along with returnVal
- Uses consistent configuration structure (cfg)
- Maintains the return value pattern used elsewhere

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	select {
	case <-stopper:
		return returnVal, errors.New("Keploy was interupted by stopper")
	default:
		// load the ebpf hooks into the kernel
		if err := returnVal.LoadedHooks.LoadHooks(cfg.AppCmd, cfg.AppContainer, 0, context.Background()); err != nil {
			return returnVal, err
		}
	}

	select {
	case <-stopper:

```
