Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same `bindataFileInfo` structure, but with different `modTime` values:

- HEAD has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- The incoming change has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The only other difference is the spacing after `info:` - HEAD has two spaces while the incoming change has one space.

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (based on the function names and structure), and the incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), the semantic intent seems to be updating to the latest version of the generated assets.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreNodeBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Node", size: 529, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreNotepadpp = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x52\x56\xf0\xcb\x2f\x49\x2d\x48\x4c\xd1\xd6\x56\x48\x4a\x4c\xce\x2e\x2d\x28\x56\x50\xe6\xe5\xd2\xd2\x4b\x4a\xcc\xe6\xe5\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x7b\xcd\x03\x1c\x1e\x00\x00\x00")
