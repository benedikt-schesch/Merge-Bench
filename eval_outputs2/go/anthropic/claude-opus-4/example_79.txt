Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call a `validate` function but with different signatures:

- HEAD (left side): `validate(req)` - simpler version with just the request
- Incoming change (right side): `validate(ctx, req, o.shouldFailFast, o.onValidationErrCallback)` - enhanced version with context and options

The semantic intent appears to be that the incoming change is an enhancement that adds more functionality to the validation (context support, fail-fast behavior, and error callbacks). This is consistent with the function accepting `opts ...Option` and creating an options object `o := evaluateOpts(opts)`.

The resolution should use the enhanced version from the incoming change since it provides the additional functionality that the options pattern is designed to support.

```go
// Note that generated codes prior to protoc-gen-validate v0.6.0 do not provide an all-validation
// interface. In this case the interceptor fallbacks to legacy validation and `all` is ignored.
func UnaryServerInterceptor(opts ...Option) grpc.UnaryServerInterceptor {
	o := evaluateOpts(opts)
	return func(ctx context.Context, req interface{}, info *grpc.UnaryServerInfo, handler grpc.UnaryHandler) (interface{}, error) {
		if err := validate(ctx, req, o.shouldFailFast, o.onValidationErrCallback); err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		return handler(ctx, req)
	}
}

```
