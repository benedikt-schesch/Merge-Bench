Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add environment variables to the `env` slice, but for different purposes:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Adds cross-compilation PATH environment variable conditionally
- **Right side**: Disables Go modules by setting `GO111MODULE=off`

Both changes appear to be independent and complementary - one deals with cross-compilation setup and the other with Go modules configuration. The semantic intent is to properly configure the build environment, and both additions serve different aspects of that configuration.

Here's the resolved conflict that includes both changes:

```go
	for _, arch := range androidArchs {
		env := androidEnv[arch]
		// Add the generated packages to GOPATH for reverse bindings.
		gopath := fmt.Sprintf("GOPATH=%s%c%s", tmpdir, filepath.ListSeparator, goEnv("GOPATH"))
		env = append(env, gopath)
		if cenv[arch] != "" {
			env = append(env, cenv[arch]) // Add the Cross Compile PATH Env
		}
		// gomobile-bind does not support modules yet.
		env = append(env, "GO111MODULE=off")
		toolchain := ndk.Toolchain(arch)

		err := goBuildAt(
			filepath.Join(tmpdir, "src"),
			"./gobind",
```
