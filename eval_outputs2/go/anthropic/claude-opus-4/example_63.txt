Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to add a deprecation comment to the `UnmarshalMessageSet` function. The only difference is in capitalization:

- HEAD version: `// Deprecated: Do not use.`
- Other branch: `// Deprecated: do not use.`

Since both sides have the same semantic intent (marking the function as deprecated), I'll resolve this by choosing the more common Go convention, which is to capitalize the first word after "Deprecated:" in godoc comments.

```go
>>>>>>> 84668698ea25b64748563aa20726db66a6b8d299
func MarshalMessageSet(interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
	return nil, errors.New("proto: not implemented")
}

// Deprecated: Do not use.
func UnmarshalMessageSet([]byte, interface{}) error {
	return errors.New("proto: not implemented")
}

```
