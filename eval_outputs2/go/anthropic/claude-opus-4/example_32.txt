Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to create the same `bindataFileInfo` struct with identical values except for the `modTime` field:

- HEAD has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- The incoming branch has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The only semantic difference is the modification timestamp. Since this appears to be generated code (likely from a tool that embeds files as Go code), and the newer timestamp (1467390283) is from the incoming branch, it makes sense to accept the more recent timestamp.

The only other difference is whitespace - HEAD has two spaces after `info:` while the incoming branch has one space. Following Go formatting conventions, one space is standard.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreDrupalBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Drupal", size: 605, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreEpiserver = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x52\xc6\x0a\xb8\x94\x95\x15\x5c\x03\x32\x83\x53\x8b\xca\x52\x8b\x14\xdc\x32\x73\x52\x8b\xb9\x70\xa8\xd4\xf2\xc9\x4c\x4e\xcd\x2b\x4e\xd5\x4b\xce\xcf\x4b\xcb\x4c\xe7\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x67\x4c\x1e\xeb\x51\x00\x00\x00")
