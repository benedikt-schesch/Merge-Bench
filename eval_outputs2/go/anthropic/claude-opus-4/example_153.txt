Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to add an import for `"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/internal/casing"`, while the other branch (0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6) doesn't have this import.

Without more context about what functionality requires the casing package or what changes were made in the rest of the file, I cannot determine with certainty whether this import should be included or not. The intent is ambiguous - it could be that:
1. The HEAD branch added functionality that requires the casing package
2. The other branch removed functionality that no longer needs the casing package
3. This is a refactoring where the import was moved or replaced

Since I cannot determine the correct resolution without understanding the broader context of the changes, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```go
package server

import (
	"strings"
