Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version has an extra blank line after the `runtime.Int64Value(val)` assignment, while the other branch doesn't have this blank line.

Given that this is a minor formatting difference and both sides have the same functional code, I'll resolve this by keeping the version without the extra blank line for consistency with the surrounding code style (there are no other double-spaced sections in the visible context).

```go
	if !ok {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "missing parameter %s", "int64Val")
	}

	protoReq.Int64Val, err = runtime.Int64Value(val)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "type mismatch, parameter: %s, error: %v", "int64Val", err)
	}

	if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {

```
