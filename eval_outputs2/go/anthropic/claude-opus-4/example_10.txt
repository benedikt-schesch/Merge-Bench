Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import the `net/mail` package, but with different approaches:

- HEAD imports it as `"net/mail"` (using the standard name)
- The other branch imports it as `stdmail "net/mail"` (using an alias)

Additionally, HEAD includes `"os"` import while the other branch doesn't.

Since both sides want the mail package imported, and using an alias like `stdmail` is a common practice to avoid naming conflicts (especially when there might be other mail-related imports), I'll resolve this by keeping the aliased import and the `os` import from HEAD:

```go

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	stdmail "net/mail"
	"os"
)

// Sender is the interface that wraps the Send method.
//
// Send sends an email to the given addresses.

```
