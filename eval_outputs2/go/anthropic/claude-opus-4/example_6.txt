Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD: Changed `in` to be of type `io.Reader` (more generic interface)
- Other branch: Changed `in` to be of type `*os.File` (more specific type)

This appears to be a classic conflict between making the code more generic/testable (io.Reader) versus needing specific OS file functionality (*os.File).

Without more context about the specific requirements of this code, I cannot determine which approach is correct. The io.Reader interface is more flexible and allows for easier testing and different input sources, while *os.File provides access to file-specific operations that might be necessary.

Since the intent is ambiguous without knowing the broader codebase requirements, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict intact:

```go
	ti          *Terminfo
	h           int
	w           int
	fini        bool
	cells       CellBuffer
<<<<<<< HEAD
	in          io.Reader
=======
	in          *os.File
>>>>>>> a221f2faf4f9a059c8eba8f91c5d0dbd9845a985

	curstyle    Style
	style       Style
	evch        chan Event
	sigwinch    chan os.Signal
