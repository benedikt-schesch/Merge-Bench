Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has an additional import/variable declaration for `descriptor.ForMessage` that the other branch doesn't have.

Since this appears to be in a section of variable declarations that are likely used to ensure imports are not removed by the compiler (common pattern in Go), and the rest of the code context doesn't show any usage of `descriptor.ForMessage`, I cannot determine with certainty whether this import is needed or not.

Without more context about whether the `descriptor` package is actually used elsewhere in the file, I cannot make a safe decision about which version to keep.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```go
var _ codes.Code
var _ io.Reader
var _ status.Status
var _ = runtime.String
var _ = utilities.NewDoubleArray
<<<<<<< HEAD
var _ = descriptor.ForMessage
=======
>>>>>>> 0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6
var _ = metadata.Join

func request_WrappersService_Create_0(ctx context.Context, marshaler runtime.Marshaler, client WrappersServiceClient, req *http.Request, pathParams map[string]string) (proto.Message, runtime.ServerMetadata, error) {
	var protoReq Wrappers
	var metadata runtime.ServerMetadata
