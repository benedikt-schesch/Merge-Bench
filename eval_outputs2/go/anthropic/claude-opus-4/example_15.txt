Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to create the same `bindataFileInfo` struct with identical values except for the `modTime` field:

- HEAD has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- The incoming change has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a tool that embeds files as Go code), and the only difference is the modification timestamp, I should preserve the more recent timestamp. The timestamp `1467390283` (July 1, 2016) is more recent than `1444419364` (October 9, 2015).

Additionally, I notice there's a minor formatting difference in the spacing after `info:` - the incoming change has one space while HEAD has two. I'll use the single space as it appears to be the intended formatting.

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreSvnBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/SVN", size: 6, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreSass = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\x2b\x4e\x2c\x2e\xd6\x4d\x4e\x4c\xce\x48\xd5\xe7\xd2\xd2\x4b\x2e\x2e\xd6\xcb\x4d\x2c\xe0\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x30\x6e\x9e\x4b\x17\x00\x00\x00")
