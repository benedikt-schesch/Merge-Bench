Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add fields to the `models.MockSpec` struct initialization, but with different formatting:

- HEAD side: adds just the `Created` field
- Other side: adds `Created`, `ReqTimestampMock`, and `ResTimestampMock` fields with different spacing

The semantic intent is clear - both sides want to include the `Created` field, and the other side additionally wants to include the two timestamp mock fields. This is an additive change where we should keep all fields.

Here's the resolved version:

```go
			}
			mock.Spec = models.MockSpec{
				Metadata: httpSpec.Metadata,
				HttpReq:  &httpSpec.Request,
				HttpResp: &httpSpec.Response,
				Created:          httpSpec.Created,
				ReqTimestampMock: httpSpec.ReqTimestampMock,
				ResTimestampMock: httpSpec.ResTimestampMock,
			}
		case models.Mongo:
			mongoSpec := spec.MongoSpec{}
			err := m.Spec.Decode(&mongoSpec)
			if err != nil {

```
