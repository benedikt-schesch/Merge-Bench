Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the only difference between the two versions is the presence or absence of a blank line after the `protoReq.Int32Val, err = runtime.Int32Value(val)` statement.

The HEAD version includes a blank line, while the incoming version (0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6) does not. This is purely a formatting difference with no semantic impact.

Since both versions are functionally identical and this is just a stylistic difference, I'll resolve this by keeping the version without the blank line for consistency with the compact style of the surrounding code:

```go
	if !ok {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "missing parameter %s", "int32Val")
	}

	protoReq.Int32Val, err = runtime.Int32Value(val)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "type mismatch, parameter: %s, error: %v", "int32Val", err)
	}

	if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {

```
