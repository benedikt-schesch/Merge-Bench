Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (the branch being merged in) wants to add an import for the "bytes" package, while HEAD doesn't have this import. Since this is just an import addition with no conflicting changes, the semantic intent is clear - to include the bytes package.

Here's the resolved code:

```go

package download

import (
	"bytes"
	"io"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
	"reflect"

```
