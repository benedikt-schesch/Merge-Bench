Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same `bindataFileInfo` struct initialization, but with different values:

- **HEAD**: Uses `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- **Incoming change**: Uses `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The only differences between the two versions are:
1. The `modTime` timestamp value
2. A minor formatting difference (extra space after `info:` in the incoming change)

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a tool that embeds files as Go code), and the incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 > 1444419364), the semantic intent is likely to update to the newer version.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreDartBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Dart", size: 234, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreDarteditor = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\x2b\x28\xca\xcf\x4a\x4d\x2e\xe1\xd2\x4b\x2a\xcd\xcc\x49\xc9\xc9\x4f\xe7\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x75\xc6\x26\xcf\x13\x00\x00\x00")
