Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch (current branch) has an additional import/variable declaration:

```go
var _ = descriptor.ForMessage
```

While the incoming branch (0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6) does not have this line.

This appears to be a typical import-related conflict where one branch added a dependency that the other branch doesn't have. Without more context about whether the `descriptor.ForMessage` is actually needed in the code, I'll preserve the conflict as-is since the intent is ambiguous:

```go
var _ codes.Code
var _ io.Reader
var _ status.Status
var _ = runtime.String
var _ = utilities.NewDoubleArray
<<<<<<< HEAD
var _ = descriptor.ForMessage
=======
>>>>>>> 0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6
var _ = metadata.Join

func request_LoginService_Login_0(ctx context.Context, marshaler runtime.Marshaler, client LoginServiceClient, req *http.Request, pathParams map[string]string) (proto.Message, runtime.ServerMetadata, error) {
	var protoReq LoginRequest
	var metadata runtime.ServerMetadata

```
