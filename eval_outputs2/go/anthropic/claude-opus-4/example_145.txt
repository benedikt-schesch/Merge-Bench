Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they're both setting up a default error response for an OpenAPI operation. The only difference is in the naming convention used for the types:

- The HEAD branch uses `swagger` prefix (`swaggerResponseObject`, `swaggerSchemaObject`)
- The incoming branch uses `openapi` prefix (`openapiResponseObject`, `openapiSchemaObject`)

Based on the file paths shown in the conflict markers, it appears there was a refactoring from "swagger" to "openapiv2":
- HEAD: `protoc-gen-swagger/genswagger/template.go`
- Incoming: `protoc-gen-openapiv2/internal/genopenapi/template.go`

The incoming branch represents a more modern naming convention (OpenAPI instead of Swagger), which aligns with the current industry standard terminology. Therefore, I'll resolve this by accepting the incoming changes:

```go
				}
				if !reg.GetDisableDefaultErrors() {
					errDef, hasErrDef := fullyQualifiedNameToOpenAPIName(".google.rpc.Status", reg)
					if hasErrDef {
						// https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.0/versions/2.0.md#responses-object
						operationObject.Responses["default"] = openapiResponseObject{
							Description: "An unexpected error response.",
							Schema: openapiSchemaObject{
								schemaCore: schemaCore{
									Ref: fmt.Sprintf("#/definitions/%s", errDef),
								},
							},
						}

```
