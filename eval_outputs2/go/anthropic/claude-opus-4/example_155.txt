Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the `onEvict` field, but with different approaches:

- HEAD uses a type alias `onEvictFunc`
- The incoming change uses an inline function type `func(uint64, uint64, interface{}, int64)`

Since both sides have the same intent (defining a callback for item evictions) and the incoming change includes a more detailed comment with a period at the end, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD's approach with the type alias (which is cleaner) but using the improved comment from the incoming change:

```go
	// keys are read.
	getBuf *ringBuffer
	// setBuf is a buffer allowing us to batch/drop Sets during times of high
	// contention.
	setBuf chan *item
	// onEvict is called for item evictions.
	onEvict onEvictFunc
	// KeyToHash function is used to customize the key hashing algorithm.
	// Each key will be hashed using the provided function. If keyToHash value
	// is not set, the default keyToHash function is used.
	keyToHash func(interface{}) (uint64, uint64)
	// stop is used to stop the processItems goroutine.
```
