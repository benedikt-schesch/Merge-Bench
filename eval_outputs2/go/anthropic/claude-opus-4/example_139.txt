Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they're handling JSON schema type conversions. The main differences are:

1. The namespace/package has changed from `swagger_options` to `openapi_options`
2. The comment has been updated from "swagger specification" to "OpenAPI specification"
3. The file path has changed from `protoc-gen-swagger/genswagger/template.go` to `protoc-gen-openapiv2/internal/genopenapi/template.go`

This appears to be a refactoring from Swagger to OpenAPI terminology. The resolved version should use the newer OpenAPI naming:

```go
	case openapi_options.JSONSchema_INTEGER:
		return "integer", "int32"
	case openapi_options.JSONSchema_NUMBER:
		return "number", "double"
	case openapi_options.JSONSchema_STRING:
		// NOTE: in OpenAPI specification, format should be empty on string type
		return "string", ""
	default:
		// Maybe panic?
		return "", ""
	}
```
