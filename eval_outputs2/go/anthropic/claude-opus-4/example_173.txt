Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call the `recordMessage` function but with different parameters:

- **HEAD** (base branch): Has a simpler function call with fewer parameters
- **Incoming branch**: Adds additional parameters: `logStr`, `reqTimestampMock`, and `logger`

The semantic intent appears to be that the incoming branch is enhancing the `recordMessage` function to include more logging/debugging information and timestamp mocking capabilities. This seems like a feature enhancement rather than conflicting changes.

The resolution should accept the incoming branch's version since it appears to be adding functionality without removing the original intent.

```go
				if i == 0 && isHeartBeat(opReq, *mongoRequests[0].Header, mongoRequests[0].Message, logger) {
					go func() {
						// Recover from panic and gracefully shutdown
						defer h.Recover(pkg.GenerateRandomID())
						defer utils.HandlePanic()
						recordMessage(h, requestBuffer, responseBuffer, logStr, mongoRequests, mongoResponses, opReq, ctx, reqTimestampMock, logger)
					}()
				}
				started = time.Now()
				responseBuffer, err = util.ReadBytes(destConn)
				// logStr += tmpStr

```
