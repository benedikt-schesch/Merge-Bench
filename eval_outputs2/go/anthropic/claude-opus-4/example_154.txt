Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch) wants to include imports for "log", "os", and "runtime"
- The incoming branch (a928883b...) wants to remove these imports

Without more context about how these imports are used in the rest of the file, I cannot determine which side's intent is correct. The imports might be needed for the test functionality, or they might have been unnecessary and correctly removed in the other branch.

Since the intent is ambiguous without seeing the actual test implementation, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```go
	"bytes"
	"image"
	"image/color"
	_ "image/jpeg"
	_ "image/png"
<<<<<<< HEAD
	"log"
	"os"
	"runtime"
=======
>>>>>>> a928883b203bf3d06bded8e3ee93a01653c0b96b
	"strings"
	"testing"
)

func TestMat(t *testing.T) {
