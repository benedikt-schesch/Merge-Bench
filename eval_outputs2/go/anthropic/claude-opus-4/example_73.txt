Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - comparing `got` and `want` in the error message. The only difference is:

- HEAD version uses `&got` and `&want` (passing addresses)
- The other version uses `got` and `want` (passing values directly)

Since just above the conflict we can see `if !proto.Equal(&got, &want)` which uses addresses, and the error message is logically part of this same comparison, it makes sense to be consistent and use the address form in the error message as well.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
		want.TypeUrl = "blah.com/" + dynamicMessageName
		want.Value = b
	}

	if !proto.Equal(&got, &want) {
		t.Errorf("message contents not set correctly after unmarshaling JSON: got %v, wanted %v", &got, &want)
	}
}

const (
	dynamicMessageName = "github_com.golang.protobuf.jsonpb.dynamicMessage"

```
