Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are calling `runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext`, but they differ in the number of arguments:

- HEAD version: 3 arguments - `(ctx, mux, req)`
- Incoming version: 4 arguments - `(ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello")`

The incoming change adds a fourth argument which appears to be the full gRPC method path. This is likely an API change in the runtime library where the method now requires the full method path for proper context annotation.

Since this appears to be handling a specific gRPC endpoint for the Greeter service's SayHello method, and the incoming change provides more specific information (the full method path), the semantic intent is to properly annotate the context with the specific gRPC method being called.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
		ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(req.Context())
		defer cancel()
		var stream runtime.ServerTransportStream
		ctx = grpc.NewContextWithServerTransportStream(ctx, &stream)
		inboundMarshaler, outboundMarshaler := runtime.MarshalerForRequest(mux, req)
		rctx, err := runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext(ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello")
		if err != nil {
			runtime.HTTPError(ctx, mux, outboundMarshaler, w, req, err)
			return
		}
		resp, md, err := local_request_Greeter_SayHello_6(rctx, inboundMarshaler, server, req, pathParams)

```
