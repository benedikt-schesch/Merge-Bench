Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch adds a check for component revisions while the other branch removes this section. Based on the context and the pattern of the test (which appears to be testing deployments and then cleaning up), the HEAD branch seems to be adding an additional verification step.

Since both sides have valid intent - HEAD wants to verify component revisions exist, while the other branch may have removed it for simplification or because it's tested elsewhere - and without more context about why the removal happened, I'll preserve the conflict as is:

```go
				g.Expect(k8sClient.List(workerCtx, deploys, client.InNamespace(namespace))).Should(Succeed())
				g.Expect(len(deploys.Items)).Should(Equal(2))
				deploys = &v13.DeploymentList{}
				g.Expect(k8sClient.List(workerCtx, deploys, client.InNamespace(prodNamespace))).Should(Succeed())
				g.Expect(len(deploys.Items)).Should(Equal(2))
<<<<<<< HEAD
				// check component revision
				compRevs := &v13.ControllerRevisionList{}
				g.Expect(k8sClient.List(workerCtx, compRevs, client.InNamespace(prodNamespace))).Should(Succeed())
				g.Expect(len(compRevs.Items)).Should(Equal(2))
