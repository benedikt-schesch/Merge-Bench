Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to fix the same issue - avoiding the loop variable capture problem in Go. Both versions create a local copy of the `iface` variable to ensure each iteration has its own copy when taking the address.

The only difference is the naming:
- HEAD uses `tmp` as the loop variable and `iface` as the local copy
- The other branch uses `iface` as the loop variable and `t` as the local copy

Since both achieve the same semantic intent and the rest of the code uses `iface`, I'll resolve this by keeping the version that maintains `iface` as the variable name used throughout the rest of the code block:

```go
	sort.Sort(rtr.v6)
	ifaces, err := net.Interfaces()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	for _, tmp := range ifaces {
		iface := tmp
		rtr.ifaces[iface.Index] = &iface
		var addrs ipAddrs
		ifaceAddrs, err := iface.Addrs()
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}

```
