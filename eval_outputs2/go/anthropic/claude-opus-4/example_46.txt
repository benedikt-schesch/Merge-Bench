Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same `bindataFileInfo` struct initialization, but with different values:

- **HEAD**: Uses `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)` and has a space after `info:`
- **Branch (73fedc7...)**: Uses `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)` and has no space after `info:`

The semantic intent appears to be updating the modification time of the Joomla gitignore file. The branch has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), which likely represents a newer version of the file.

The spacing difference after `info:` is minor and doesn't affect functionality, but for consistency with the branch's formatting, I'll use no space.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreJoomlaBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Joomla", size: 22387, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreKdevelop4 = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xd2\xcb\x4e\x49\x2d\x33\xe1\x82\x50\xfa\x5c\x80\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\xe2\x3d\x7b\x0d\x10\x00\x00\x00")
