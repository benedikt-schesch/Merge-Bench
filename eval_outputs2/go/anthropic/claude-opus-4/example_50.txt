Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same `bindataFileInfo` struct initialization. The only difference between the two versions is:

- HEAD: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- Incoming: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

Both sides have identical changes to the spacing (removing an extra space before `info`), which suggests they're part of the same formatting cleanup effort. The semantic intent appears to be updating the modification timestamp while also fixing the formatting.

Since the incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), it likely represents the most up-to-date version of the file. The more recent timestamp should be preserved.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreLemonstandBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/LemonStand", size: 348, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreLibreoffice = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x52\x56\xf0\xc9\x4c\x2a\x4a\xf5\x4f\x4b\xcb\x4c\x4e\x55\xc8\xc9\x4f\xce\x2e\xe6\xd2\xab\x03\xd1\x7a\x5a\xca\x5c\x80\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\x7a\x7d\x60\x16\x1e\x00\x00\x00")
