Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line with slightly different changes:

1. **HEAD**: Updates the `modTime` to `time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
2. **Incoming change**: Updates the `modTime` to `time.Unix(1467390283, 0)` AND removes an extra space between `info:` and `info`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to update the modification time (the incoming change has a more recent timestamp: 1467390283 vs 1444419364)
- The incoming change also includes a formatting fix to remove the extra space

The best resolution would be to take the more recent timestamp from the incoming change AND keep the formatting fix:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreAdaBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Ada", size: 51, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreAgda = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xd2\x4b\x4c\x4f\x49\xcc\xe4\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x27\x6c\x17\xd3\x08\x00\x00\x00")
