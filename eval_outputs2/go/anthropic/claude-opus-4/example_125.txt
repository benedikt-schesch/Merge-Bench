Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add imports to the same section of the code. The HEAD branch is keeping the existing imports, while the incoming branch is adding a new import for `protojson` from the protobuf library.

Since both changes appear to be intentional and compatible (one side maintains existing imports while the other adds a new one), the semantic intent is to have both - the existing imports AND the new protojson import.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	"errors"
	"mime"
	"net/http"

	"google.golang.org/grpc/grpclog"
	"google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson"
)

// MIMEWildcard is the fallback MIME type used for requests which do not match
// a registered MIME type.
const MIMEWildcard = "*"

```
