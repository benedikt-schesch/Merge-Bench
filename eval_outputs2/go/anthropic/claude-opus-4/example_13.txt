Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line that creates a `bindataFileInfo` struct. The differences are:

1. **HEAD**: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)` with spacing `info:  info` (two spaces)
2. **Incoming**: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)` with spacing `info: info` (one space)

The semantic intent appears to be updating the modification timestamp. The incoming change has a newer timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), which makes sense as it's likely updating the embedded file's metadata to reflect a more recent modification.

The spacing difference (`info:  info` vs `info: info`) appears to be a formatting inconsistency. Following Go conventions, single space formatting is more standard.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreRailsBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Rails", size: 707, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreRedcar = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\x2b\x4a\x4d\x49\x4e\x2c\xe2\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\xfb\x2a\xf8\x5b\x08\x00\x00\x00")
