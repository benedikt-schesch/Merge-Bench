Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same `bindataFileInfo` struct initialization, with the only difference being:
- HEAD: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- Incoming change: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), which likely represents a more recent modification to the file. Since this appears to be auto-generated code for embedding files (based on the function name `confGitignoreCudaBytes()` and the binary data below), the more recent timestamp should be used.

The only other minor difference is spacing after `info:` - the incoming change has one space while HEAD has two spaces. The single space is more consistent with typical Go formatting.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreCudaBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/CUDA", size: 38, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreCvs = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\x77\x0e\x0b\xd6\xd7\xe2\xd2\x82\xd2\x7a\xc9\x65\xc5\x99\xe9\x79\xf9\x45\xa9\x40\x21\x24\x0e\x20\x00\x00\xff\xff\x5f\xf2\xf4\xa0\x27\x00\x00\x00")
