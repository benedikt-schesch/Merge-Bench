Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line of code that creates a `bindataFileInfo` struct. The only difference between the two versions is the `modTime` parameter:

- HEAD version: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- Incoming version: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The incoming version has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), which likely represents a newer modification time for the file.

Since this appears to be auto-generated code for embedded assets (based on the function names and structure), and the only difference is the timestamp, the semantic intent is to update the modification time to reflect when the file was last changed. The more recent timestamp should be used.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreExpressionengineBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/ExpressionEngine", size: 342, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreExtjs = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\x4b\x2c\x4a\xce\xc8\x2c\x49\x4d\x2e\xe1\x4a\xca\xcf\x2f\x29\x2e\x29\x4a\x2c\xd0\xcb\x2a\xce\xcf\xe3\x4a\x2a\xcd\xcc\x49\xd1\xe7\x4a\xad\x28\xd1\xe7\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x9c\x9c\x0a\x09\x26\x00\x00\x00")
```
