Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line with slightly different values:

1. **HEAD** has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)` and `info:  info` (with two spaces)
2. **Incoming** has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)` and `info: info` (with one space)

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides are updating the modification timestamp (likely due to regenerating the bindata)
- The incoming change has a newer timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364)
- The spacing difference in `info:  info` vs `info: info` appears to be a formatting inconsistency

Since this appears to be generated code (bindata) and the incoming change has the newer timestamp, I'll resolve by accepting the incoming change with the newer timestamp and consistent spacing:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreSconsBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/SCons", size: 90, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreSvn = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\x2b\x2e\xcb\xd3\xe7\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\xe3\x97\xc2\xcc\x06\x00\x00\x00")
