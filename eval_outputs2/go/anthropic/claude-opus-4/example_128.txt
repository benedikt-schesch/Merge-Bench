Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) wants to include `var _ = descriptor.ForMessage` while the other side removed it. 

Based on the context of this gRPC-gateway generated code, these underscore imports are used to ensure packages are imported even if not directly referenced in the generated code. The fact that the other side explicitly removed this line suggests it's no longer needed (perhaps the `descriptor` package is no longer used in the generated code or has been replaced).

Since this appears to be generated code and the removal seems intentional, I'll resolve by accepting the deletion:

```go
var _ codes.Code
var _ io.Reader
var _ status.Status
var _ = runtime.String
var _ = utilities.NewDoubleArray
var _ = metadata.Join

func request_ResponseBodyService_GetResponseBody_0(ctx context.Context, marshaler runtime.Marshaler, client ResponseBodyServiceClient, req *http.Request, pathParams map[string]string) (proto.Message, runtime.ServerMetadata, error) {
	var protoReq ResponseBodyIn
	var metadata runtime.ServerMetadata

```
