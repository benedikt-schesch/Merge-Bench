Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version has an empty line after `protoReq.Parent, err = runtime.String(val)` while the incoming change (0e11f6f8f...) removes that empty line.

This appears to be a simple whitespace/formatting conflict. Since this is just about the presence or absence of a blank line between the assignment and the error check, and both versions are functionally identical, I'll resolve by removing the blank line to match the incoming change (which likely represents a code cleanup or formatting standardization).

```go
	if !ok {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "missing parameter %s", "parent")
	}

	protoReq.Parent, err = runtime.String(val)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "type mismatch, parameter: %s, error: %v", "parent", err)
	}

	if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {

```
