Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - they're both updating terminology from "swagger" to "openapi". The conflict appears to be due to simultaneous changes where:

- HEAD is keeping the old "swagger" terminology
- The incoming change (0e11f6f8...) is updating to "openapi" terminology and also shows a file rename from `protoc-gen-swagger/genswagger/template.go` to `protoc-gen-openapiv2/internal/genopenapi/template.go`

The intent is clear: migrate from Swagger to OpenAPI terminology. The incoming change should be accepted as it represents the desired state.

```go
		}
	}
	return ""
}

// messageToQueryParameters converts a message to a list of OpenAPI query parameters.
func messageToQueryParameters(message *descriptor.Message, reg *descriptor.Registry, pathParams []descriptor.Parameter, body *descriptor.Body) (params []openapiParameterObject, err error) {
	for _, field := range message.Fields {
		p, err := queryParams(message, field, "", reg, pathParams, body)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}

```
