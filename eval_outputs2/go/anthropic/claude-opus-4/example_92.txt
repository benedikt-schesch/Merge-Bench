Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has no blank line between the two error handling blocks, while the other side has added a blank line for better code readability.

Since both sides have the same functional code and the only difference is formatting (the presence of a blank line), I'll resolve this by keeping the blank line as it improves code readability by separating the two distinct error handling blocks.

```go
		formatted, err := format.Source([]byte(code))
		if err != nil {
			glog.Errorf("%v: %s", err, code)
			return nil, err
		}

		name, err := g.getFilePath(file)
		if err != nil {
			glog.Errorf("%v: %s", err, code)
			return nil, err
		}

```
