Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD has version "0.35.0" (a stable release version)
- The incoming branch has version "0.36.0-dev" (a development version)

This appears to be a typical version bump conflict where HEAD has a stable release version and the incoming branch has moved to the next development version. The semantic intent is to use the newer version number.

Since "0.36.0-dev" is a higher version than "0.35.0" and follows the pattern of moving to the next development version after a release, the conflict should be resolved by accepting the incoming change.

```go

// CurrentCommit is the current git commit, this is set as a ldflag in the Makefile.
var CurrentCommit string

// CurrentVersionNumber is the current application's version literal.
const CurrentVersionNumber = "0.36.0-dev"

const ApiVersion = "/kubo/" + CurrentVersionNumber + "/" //nolint

// GetUserAgentVersion is the libp2p user agent used by go-ipfs.
//
