Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are calling `runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext`, but the newer version (from the merge) includes an additional parameter - the full RPC method name "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello".

This appears to be an API change in the runtime library where `AnnotateIncomingContext` now requires the RPC method name to be passed as a parameter. The HEAD version is using the older API without this parameter, while the incoming change has updated to the new API.

The semantic intent is clear - the incoming change is updating the code to use the new API that requires the method name for proper context annotation. This is likely for better logging, tracing, or routing purposes.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
		ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(req.Context())
		defer cancel()
		var stream runtime.ServerTransportStream
		ctx = grpc.NewContextWithServerTransportStream(ctx, &stream)
		inboundMarshaler, outboundMarshaler := runtime.MarshalerForRequest(mux, req)
		rctx, err := runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext(ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello")
		if err != nil {
			runtime.HTTPError(ctx, mux, outboundMarshaler, w, req, err)
			return
		}
		resp, md, err := local_request_Greeter_SayHello_2(rctx, inboundMarshaler, server, req, pathParams)
```
