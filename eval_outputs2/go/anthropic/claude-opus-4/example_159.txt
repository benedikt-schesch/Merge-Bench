Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to test the same functionality - setting the first day of the week to Monday and checking that `BeginningOfWeek()` returns the correct date. 

The key differences are:
- HEAD uses `WeekStartDay = time.Monday` 
- The other branch uses `FirstDayMonday = true`
- HEAD uses a manual if-statement check
- The other branch uses the `assert` helper function (consistent with the rest of the test)

Since the surrounding context uses the `assert` helper function pattern, and without knowing which variable name is correct in this codebase, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The semantic intent is the same, but the implementation details differ.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```go

	assert(New(nDst).EndOfSunday(), "2017-10-29 23:59:59.999999999", "EndOfSunday DST")

	assert(New(n).BeginningOfWeek(), "2013-11-17 00:00:00", "BeginningOfWeek, FirstDayMonday")

<<<<<<< HEAD
	WeekStartDay = time.Monday
	if New(n).BeginningOfWeek().Format(format) != "2013-11-18 00:00:00" {
		t.Errorf("BeginningOfWeek, FirstDayMonday")
	}
=======
	FirstDayMonday = true
	assert(New(n).BeginningOfWeek(), "2013-11-18 00:00:00", "BeginningOfWeek, FirstDayMonday")
>>>>>>> 369cc5db8afeb349cdd6af857127799844d237f2
}

func TestParse(t *testing.T) {
	assert := assertT(t)


```
