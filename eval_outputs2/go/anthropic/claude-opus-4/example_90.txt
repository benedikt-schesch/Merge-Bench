Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has an additional import/variable declaration `var _ = descriptor.ForMessage` that the other branch doesn't have.

Since this appears to be a list of import declarations (using the blank identifier pattern to ensure packages are imported), and the HEAD branch is adding an additional import that the other branch lacks, the semantic intent seems to be that HEAD wants to ensure the `descriptor.ForMessage` is available in this file.

The most reasonable resolution is to keep the additional import from HEAD, as it's likely needed for some functionality and removing it could break the build.

```go
var _ codes.Code
var _ io.Reader
var _ status.Status
var _ = runtime.String
var _ = utilities.NewDoubleArray
var _ = descriptor.ForMessage
var _ = metadata.Join

func request_FlowCombination_RpcEmptyRpc_0(ctx context.Context, marshaler runtime.Marshaler, client FlowCombinationClient, req *http.Request, pathParams map[string]string) (proto.Message, runtime.ServerMetadata, error) {
	var protoReq EmptyProto
	var metadata runtime.ServerMetadata

```
