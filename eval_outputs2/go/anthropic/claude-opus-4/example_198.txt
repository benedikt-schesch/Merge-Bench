Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to describe the same test case, but there's a typo in one version:

- HEAD version: "rollout scale up and down without rollout batches" (correct spelling)
- Other version: "rollout scale up adnd down without rollout batches" (typo: "adnd" instead of "and")

The intent is clearly the same - to describe a test for rollout scaling operations. The HEAD version has the correct spelling, so that should be used.

```go
			}
			return nil
		}, 30*time.Second, 300*time.Millisecond).Should(BeNil())
	})

	It("rollout scale up and down without rollout batches", func() {
		By("first scale operation")
		Expect(common.ReadYamlToObject("testdata/rollout/deployment/application.yaml", &app)).Should(BeNil())
		app.Namespace = namespaceName
		Expect(k8sClient.Create(ctx, &app)).Should(BeNil())
