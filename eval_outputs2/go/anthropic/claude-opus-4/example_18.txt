Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same `bindataFileInfo` structure, with the only differences being:

1. The `modTime` field: HEAD has `time.Unix(1444419364, 0)` while the incoming change has `time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`
2. Minor spacing difference: HEAD has two spaces after `info:` while the incoming change has one space

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a tool like go-bindata), and the incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), the semantic intent is to update to the newer version. The spacing difference is minor but should be preserved from the incoming change for consistency.

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreTexBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/TeX", size: 1328, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreTextmate = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xd2\x2b\xc9\x2d\x28\xca\xcf\xe2\x82\x31\x52\x93\x4b\xb8\x4a\x72\x4b\x12\xd3\x8b\xb9\x00\x01\x00\x00\xff\xff\x36\x23\xd5\x9c\x1c\x00\x00\x00")
