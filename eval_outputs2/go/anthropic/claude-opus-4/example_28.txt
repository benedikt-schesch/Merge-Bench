Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line but with different values. The conflict is in the `bindataFileInfo` struct initialization, specifically:

- **HEAD**: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- **Incoming branch**: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The only difference between the two versions is:
1. The `modTime` timestamp value
2. The spacing after `info:` (HEAD has two spaces, incoming has one space)

Since this appears to be auto-generated code (likely from a tool that embeds files as Go code), and the incoming branch has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), the semantic intent is likely to update the embedded file with the newer version.

The incoming branch probably represents a more recent regeneration of this embedded asset file.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreComposerBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Composer", size: 250, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreConcrete5 = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x4a\xce\xcf\x4b\xcb\x4c\xd7\x2f\xce\x2c\x49\xd5\x2b\xc8\x28\xe0\x4a\xcb\xcc\x49\x2d\xd6\x4f\x4e\x4c\xce\x48\xd5\xd7\x82\xf2\x4a\x72\x0b\x80\x6c\x40\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\xfc\xcd\x2d\x30\x2a\x00\x00\x00")
