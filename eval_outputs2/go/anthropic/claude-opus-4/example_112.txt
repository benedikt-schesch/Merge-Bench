Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are calling `runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext`, but with different numbers of arguments:

- HEAD version: 3 arguments - `(ctx, mux, req)`
- Incoming version: 4 arguments - `(ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello")`

The semantic intent appears to be that the incoming version is adding an RPC method path as an additional argument to provide more context about which specific gRPC method is being called. This is likely part of an API update or enhancement to include method-specific information in the context annotation.

Since the incoming change appears to be adding useful method-specific context information that would enhance debugging, logging, or routing capabilities, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming version:

```go
		ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(req.Context())
		defer cancel()
		var stream runtime.ServerTransportStream
		ctx = grpc.NewContextWithServerTransportStream(ctx, &stream)
		inboundMarshaler, outboundMarshaler := runtime.MarshalerForRequest(mux, req)
		rctx, err := runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext(ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello")
		if err != nil {
			runtime.HTTPError(ctx, mux, outboundMarshaler, w, req, err)
			return
		}
		resp, md, err := local_request_Greeter_SayHello_9(rctx, inboundMarshaler, server, req, pathParams)

```
