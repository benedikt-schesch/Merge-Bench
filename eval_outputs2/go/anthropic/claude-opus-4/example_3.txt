Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has added two imports (`"errors"` and `"flag"`), while the other branch (56dacfd) hasn't added these imports.

Since this appears to be a simple additive change where the HEAD branch is extending the imports without conflicting with the base functionality, the semantic intent seems to be to include these additional imports that are likely needed for new functionality.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
package endless

import (
	"crypto/tls"
	"errors"
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net"
	"net/http"
	"os"

```
