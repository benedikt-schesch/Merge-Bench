Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add new boolean fields to what appears to be a struct definition. The HEAD side wants to keep just the `warnOnUnboundMethods` field, while the other branch wants to add a `standalone` field between `simpleOperationIDs` and `warnOnUnboundMethods`.

Since both additions seem to be independent features/flags being added to the registry, the semantic intent appears to be to include both fields. Here's the resolved version:

```go

	// simpleOperationIDs removes the service prefix from the generated
	// operationIDs. This risks generating duplicate operationIDs.
	simpleOperationIDs bool

	standalone bool

	// warnOnUnboundMethods causes the registry to emit warning logs if an RPC method
	// has no HttpRule annotation.
	warnOnUnboundMethods bool


```
