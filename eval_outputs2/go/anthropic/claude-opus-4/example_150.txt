Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to rename the type for the `output` field in the test struct. The conflict is about whether to use `duration.Duration` or `durationpb.Duration`.

Based on common Go conventions and protobuf patterns:
- `durationpb.Duration` is the standard naming convention for protobuf-generated duration types in Go
- The `pb` suffix clearly indicates this is a protobuf type
- This appears to be a refactoring where the import/type reference is being standardized

The intent from both sides seems to be the same - to use the proper protobuf duration type. The `durationpb.Duration` naming is more explicit and follows Go protobuf conventions better.

Here's the resolved code:

```go

func TestConvertDuration(t *testing.T) {
	specs := []struct {
		name    string
		input   string
		output  *durationpb.Duration
		wanterr bool
	}{
		{
			name:  "a valid duration",
			input: `"123.456s"`,

```
