Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different migrations after v16. The conflict arises because:

- HEAD wants to add migration v17 -> v18 (updating repository description field)
- The other branch wants to add migration v18 -> v19 (cleaning unlinked webhooks)

The issue is that the other branch skipped v17 and went directly to v18, creating a version numbering conflict.

To resolve this semantically, we need to:
1. Keep the migration from HEAD as v17 -> v18
2. Renumber the migration from the other branch to v18 -> v19

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	NewMigration("generate and migrate Git hooks", generateAndMigrateGitHooks),
	// v15 -> v16:v0.10.16
	NewMigration("update repository sizes", updateRepositorySizes),
	// v16 -> v17:v0.10.31
	NewMigration("remove invalid protect branch whitelist", removeInvalidProtectBranchWhitelist),
	// v17 -> v18:v0.11.48
	NewMigration("store long text in repository description field", updateRepositoryDescriptionField),
	// v18 -> v19:v0.11.55
	NewMigration("clean unlinked webhook and hook_tasks", cleanUnlinkedWebhookAndHookTasks),
}

// Migrate database to current version
func Migrate(x *xorm.Engine) error {
	if err := x.Sync(new(Version)); err != nil {
```
