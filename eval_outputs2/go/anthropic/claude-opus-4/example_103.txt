Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are calling `runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext`, but with different signatures:

- HEAD version: Uses 3 parameters (ctx, mux, req)
- Incoming version: Uses 4 parameters (ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello")

The incoming version adds a fourth parameter which appears to be the full gRPC method path. This is likely an API change in the runtime library where the method now requires the full service/method path for proper annotation.

Given that this is in a gRPC gateway context and the path string matches the service (Greeter) and method (SayHello) being called, the intent is clear: the newer version of the API requires the method path for proper context annotation.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
		ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(req.Context())
		defer cancel()
		var stream runtime.ServerTransportStream
		ctx = grpc.NewContextWithServerTransportStream(ctx, &stream)
		inboundMarshaler, outboundMarshaler := runtime.MarshalerForRequest(mux, req)
		rctx, err := runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext(ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello")
		if err != nil {
			runtime.HTTPError(ctx, mux, outboundMarshaler, w, req, err)
			return
		}
		resp, md, err := local_request_Greeter_SayHello_1(rctx, inboundMarshaler, server, req, pathParams)

```
