Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to improve error logging when writing a reply message to the mongo client fails:

- HEAD (current branch): Adds a basic error log with the error details
- Incoming change: Adds the same error log but with additional context (client conn id and dest conn id)

The incoming change provides more debugging information while maintaining the same intent. Since both sides want to log the error and the incoming change is more comprehensive, I'll resolve by keeping the more detailed version:

```go
				readResponseDelay := time.Since(started)

				// write the reply to mongo client
				_, err = clientConn.Write(responseBuffer)
				if err != nil {
					logger.Error("failed to write the reply message to mongo client", zap.Error(err), zap.Any("client conn id", clientConnId), zap.Any("dest conn id", destConnId))
					return
				}
				logger.Debug(fmt.Sprintf("the response in the mongo parser after passing to client: %v", len(responseBuffer)))

				// logStr += fmt.Sprintln("after writting response to the client: ", time.Since(started), "current time is: ", time.Now())

```
