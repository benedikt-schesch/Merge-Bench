Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line of code that creates a `bindataFileInfo` struct. The only difference between the two versions is the `modTime` field:

- HEAD has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- The incoming change has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

This appears to be a simple timestamp update conflict where both sides modified the same auto-generated or build-related file. The incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), which likely represents a more recent build or generation of this asset file.

Since this appears to be generated code (based on the function name pattern and the presence of embedded binary data), and the only difference is the timestamp, the semantic intent of both changes is the same - to update the asset metadata. The more recent timestamp should be preferred.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreCmakeBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/CMake", size: 89, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreCuda = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xd2\xcb\xe4\x02\x62\x10\x91\x5e\x50\x0a\x24\x0b\x4a\x2a\x80\x64\x72\x69\x52\x66\x1e\x90\x4e\x4b\x2c\x01\x31\x00\x01\x00\x00\xff\xff\xd8\x38\x0a\x95\x26\x00\x00\x00")
