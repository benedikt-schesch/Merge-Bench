Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line with different timestamps in the `modTime` field:

- HEAD has: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- The incoming change has: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The only other difference is the spacing after `info:` - HEAD has two spaces while the incoming change has one space.

Since both changes appear to be updating the modification time (likely from different build or generation processes), and the incoming change has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), I'll resolve this by taking the incoming change with the newer timestamp and the cleaner single-space formatting:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignorePerlBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Perl", size: 191, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignorePhalcon = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\x4f\x4e\x4c\xce\x48\xd5\xe7\xd2\x4f\xce\xcf\x4b\xcb\x4c\xd7\x4f\x49\x2d\x4b\xcd\xc9\x2f\xc8\x4d\xcd\x2b\xd1\xe7\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\xb8\x16\x9e\x85\x1d\x00\x00\x00")
