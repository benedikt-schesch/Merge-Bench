Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same line of code that creates a `bindataFileInfo` struct. The only difference between the two versions is the `modTime` parameter:

- HEAD version: `modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`
- Incoming version: `modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`

The incoming version has a more recent timestamp (1467390283 vs 1444419364), which likely represents a newer modification time for the file. Since this appears to be generated code for embedded assets (based on the function names and structure), the more recent timestamp is probably the correct one to use.

Additionally, I notice that the incoming version has better formatting with a space after the colon in `info: info` compared to `info:  info` (with two spaces) in the HEAD version.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreForcedotcomBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/ForceDotCom", size: 57, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreFuelphp = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x4a\x2b\x4d\xcd\xd1\x4f\x2c\x28\xd0\xcf\xc9\x4f\x2f\xd6\xd7\x02\x41\x2e\xb8\x58\x72\x62\x72\x46\x2a\x58\x08\x10\x00\x00\xff\xff\x0f\xec\xf0\x51\x27\x00\x00\x00")
