Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - they both want to parse the `uint64Val` parameter and handle the error. The only difference is that HEAD has an extra empty line after the `runtime.UInt64Value` call.

Since this is just a whitespace difference and both sides have the same semantic intent, I'll resolve this by keeping the version without the extra blank line for consistency and cleaner code:

```go
	if !ok {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "missing parameter %s", "uint64Val")
	}

	protoReq.Uint64Val, err = runtime.UInt64Value(val)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "type mismatch, parameter: %s, error: %v", "uint64Val", err)
	}

	if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {

```
