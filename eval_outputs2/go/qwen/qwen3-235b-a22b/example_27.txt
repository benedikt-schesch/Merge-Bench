The difference between the two versions is only the `modTime` field of the `bindataFileInfo` struct: one is `time.Unix(1444419364, 0)`, and the other is `time.Unix(1467390283, 0)`.

---

Preserving **intent and semantics**, both branches appear to construct the same basic asset, initializing:
- `name: "conf/gitignore/CodeKit"`
- `size: 54`
- `mode: os.FileMode(420)`
- `modTime: time.Unix(<timestamp>, 0)`
- Then assign this into a new `*asset`

These fields are **identical on both sides**, **except** for the timestamp. Since the `modTime` is the **only semantic difference**, and no contextual clue is available regarding which timestamp is more appropriate (e.g. which one reflects the correct file modification time), the conflict cannot be resolved unambiguously.

---

Therefore, per instructions, since the intent and semantics are otherwise aligned but the specific modification times differ **without additional context**, this merge conflict must be **left unresolved**.

Here is the snippet with the merge conflict as-is:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreCodekitBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/CodeKit", size: 54, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info:  info}
