The code snippet presents a classical merge conflict arising from a difference in timestamp values in two commits for the same field (`modTime`) of a `bindataFileInfo`. The structure of `info` is identical on both sides of the conflict: same `name`, `size`, `mode`, and the `bytes` field of the resulting `asset` is also the same. The only variation is in the `modTime`, which differs due to distinct Unix timestamps:

- `time.Unix(1444419364, 0)` corresponds to **2015-10-25 00:56:04 UTC**
- `time.Unix(1467390283, 0)` corresponds to **2016-07-01 21:24:43 UTC**, which is **significantly newer**.

### ðŸ§  Semantic Conflict Resolution

Since all other parts of the structure remain unchanged and the only divergence lies in the `modTime`, we must assess the **intent** of both changes:

- The `modTime` represents the last modification time of the file. In a system where this value is generated or auto-filled based on actual file timestamps, the more recent timestamp may reflect a more up-to-date state of the source file.
- If the `bytes` are generated from the fileâ€™s content and have not changed between the commits, then the newer `modTime` likely indicates a change in metadata rather than the file's content itselfâ€”possibly reflecting a re-indexing or regeneration of asset metadata.

In such cases, **the newer timestamp (`1467390283`)** reflects the more relevant or accurate `modTime` based on when the file or asset may have last been updated or rebuilt.

---

### âœ… Resolution

Based on semantic reasoning and the likely intent of reflecting a more recent state in the asset metadata, the correct resolution is to **retain the `modTime` from the non-conflicting branch (hash `73fedc7`)** that used the value `1467390283`.

Here is the resolved code snippet with the merge conflict fixed accordingly, preserving the original context and spacing:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreVvvvBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/VVVV", size: 57, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreVagrant = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\x2b\x4b\x4c\x2f\x4a\xcc\x2b\xd1\xe7\x02\x00\x00\xff\xff\xfc\x50\x87\xfb\x0a\x00\x00\x00")
