The resolution of the merge conflict depends on the explicit design intent for the `in` field, which is ambiguous from the provided snippet alone. Choosing either `io.Reader` (promoting flexibility) or `*os.File` (enforcing specificity) without further context can lead to unintended side effects in the actual usage downstream.

If `in` is only ever used with `*os.File`, such as needing direct access to file descriptors or `os.File`-specific methods, the concrete type is correct. If `in` should support generalized input (e.g., reading from buffers, network streams), the interface is more appropriate.

Since the snippet does not reveal this design intent clearly, and per instructions to preserve conflict when unsure, here is the code **with the original conflict preserved**:

```go
	ti          *Terminfo
	h           int
	w           int
	fini        bool
	cells       CellBuffer
<<<<<<< HEAD
	in          io.Reader
=======
	in          *os.File

	curstyle    Style
	style       Style
	evch        chan Event
	sigwinch    chan os.Signal
```
