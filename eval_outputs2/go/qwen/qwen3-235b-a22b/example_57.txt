The correct resolution is to **return the same snippet with the merge conflict**, because **the intent behind the change in the `modTime` value is ambiguous**. Both versions of the code are identical except for the Unix timestamp passed to `time.Unix()`:

- `time.Unix(1444419364, 0)` (HEAD)
- `time.Unix(1467390283, 0)` (other branch)

There is **no clear semantic or functional intent** provided in the context that justifies choosing one timestamp over the other. Without knowing which timestamp reflects the true last modification time of the asset, or whether itâ€™s important to preserve this metadata for build systems or caching logic, **it would be unsafe to silently pick one value**.

Merge conflicts like this one, where the difference is subtle and carries potential semantic meaning, should be explicitly resolved by the developer who understands the domain logic or the build pipeline. Therefore, the safest and most accurate action, as instructed, is to return the snippet **still containing the merge conflict**.

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreNodeBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Node", size: 529, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info:  info}
