The conflict is around the current application's version. The two options are:
1. `0.35.0` - likely represents a stable release
2. `0.36.0-dev` - indicates active development towards the next version (0.36.0)

The semantic intent appears to be: while HEAD still references the last stable version (`0.35.0`), the other side of the merge is already moving forward with development of the next version (`0.36.0-dev`).

This appears to be a legitimate version progression where both represent a natural evolution. Since the code sample shows versioned HTTP API routes (`/kubo/...`), and assuming they want the latest development version in the mainline code:

```go

// CurrentCommit is the current git commit, this is set as a ldflag in the Makefile.
var CurrentCommit string

// CurrentVersionNumber is the current application's version literal.
const CurrentVersionNumber = "0.36.0-dev"

const ApiVersion = "/kubo/" + CurrentVersionNumber + "/" //nolint

// GetUserAgentVersion is the libp2p user agent used by go-ipfs.
//

```
