The merge conflict in the provided Go code snippet presents two alternative approaches to comparing the equality of a Protocol Buffer (protobuf) message: one using `reflect.DeepEqual` and the other using `proto.Equal`. To resolve this conflict semantically, we must consider the types involved, the best practices for protobuf equality comparisons, and the intent behind both approaches.

### Contextual Breakdown

The variable `ext` is asserted as a pointer to a `pb.ComplexExtension`, which is a protobuf-generated struct implementing the `proto.Message` interface. Similarly, the `want` variable is of a type that is presumably the same or compatible with `pb.ComplexExtension`.

#### HEAD Version:
```go
if !reflect.DeepEqual(*ext, want)
```
This line dereferences the `ext` pointer and compares the underlying struct to `want` using reflection-based deep equality. While this can work for struct equality, it is not ideal for protobuf messages because:

1. **`reflect.DeepEqual` does not respect protobuf semantics** (e.g., it may not handle optional fields or extensions correctly).
2. It does not consider default values and zero-value equivalence.
3. It does not ignore unknown fields or other subtleties specific to protobuf.

#### acbe2df654d5 Version:
```go
if !proto.Equal(ext, &want)
```
This line calls `proto.Equal`, which is designed specifically for comparing protocol buffer messages in a way that respects:

1. **The protobuf wire-level equality semantics**.
2. **Proper handling of optional fields, default values, and message layouts**.
3. **Consistency across different implementations and versions**.

Moreover, `proto.Equal` expects both arguments to implement the `proto.Message` interface, which they do here: `ext` is a `*pb.ComplexExtension`, and `&want` is a pointer to a type that must also be a `proto.Message`.

### Semantic Resolution

The intent of this code is to verify that the deserialized protobuf message `ext` is semantically equivalent to the expected message `want`. Given this intent, and the fact that `proto.Equal` is the most idiomatic and accurate way to perform such a comparison in a protobuf context, the second approach is the correct one to preserve.

The HEAD version using `reflect.DeepEqual` is less appropriate for this scenario and may lead to false negatives or positives due to differing handling of protobuf-specific features.

### Final Resolved Snippet

```go
		}
		ext := e.(*pb.ComplexExtension)
		if ext == nil {
			t.Fatalf("[%s] Invalid extension", test.name)
		}
		if !proto.Equal(ext, &want) {
			t.Errorf("[%s] Wrong value for ComplexExtension: got: %s want: %s\n", test.name, ext, &want)
		}
	}
}
