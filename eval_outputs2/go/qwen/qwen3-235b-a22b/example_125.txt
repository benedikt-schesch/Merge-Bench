The code snippet contains a merge conflict in the import section. One branch added the import for `protojson`, while the other did not. The provided context includes only the import statements and a constant (`MIMEWildcard`) unrelated to `protojson`. Since there is no evidence in the given snippet that `protojson` is used or required, and the merge instructions emphasize preserving the conflict when the intent is ambiguous, the correct response is to return the unmodified snippet with the conflict markers intact.

---

**Resolution Decision:**  
The semantic intent of both merge sides is unclear from the provided context. The `protojson` import is not used in the visible portion of the code, and no surrounding logic justifies its necessity based solely on this snippet. Therefore, the conflict is preserved.
