The intent of both changes centers around correctly setting up the request context using `runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext`. The original (HEAD) version calls the function with the current set of parameters, likely working under an older version of the library or a version in which context annotation doesn't require an explicit endpoint identifier.

The incoming change adds a fifth argument — the gRPC method endpoint `"/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello"` — which implies that the updated version of the library expects this identifier to perform more accurate context annotations (e.g., route-specific headers, middleware logic, or tracing information).

From a semantic merge perspective, the addition of the endpoint path provides more explicit context about the service and method being invoked. This added detail enhances the precision and correctness of context handling, aligning with the likely intended evolution of the function's behavior.

Thus, the resolution favors the updated version with the method path argument, and it is safe to merge with that change because the added information supports correct gRPC-Gateway functionality in the service pipeline.

```go
		ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(req.Context())
		defer cancel()
		var stream runtime.ServerTransportStream
		ctx = grpc.NewContextWithServerTransportStream(ctx, &stream)
		inboundMarshaler, outboundMarshaler := runtime.MarshalerForRequest(mux, req)
		rctx, err := runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext(ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello")
		if err != nil {
			runtime.HTTPError(ctx, mux, outboundMarshaler, w, req, err)
			return
		}
		resp, md, err := local_request_Greeter_SayHello_5(rctx, inboundMarshaler, server, req, pathParams)
