The merge conflict in this test case arises between two seemingly different approaches to configuring the first day of the week for the testâ€”either by setting a `WeekStartDay` value to `time.Monday`, or by toggling a `FirstDayMonday` boolean flag.

---

### ðŸ§­ Analysis of Intent

Each side of the merge conflict appears to be attempting the same logical goal: **testing the `BeginningOfWeek()` function under the assumption that Monday is the first day of the week**.

1. **`HEAD` variant**:
   - Sets `WeekStartDay = time.Monday`
   - Then proceeds with a manual test using `if` and `t.Errorf`

2. **Other branch variant**:
   - Sets `FirstDayMonday = true`
   - Uses the existing `assert(...)` helper to verify behavior

Both approaches are *semantically equivalent* in intent, but differ in **implementation mechanism and testing style**.

---

### ðŸ§© Ambiguity in Semantics

There is ambiguity in which configuration variable (`WeekStartDay` or `FirstDayMonday`) is now preferred in the package:

- `WeekStartDay time.Weekday` implies a more general and flexible configuration interface (e.g., supporting localization).
- `FirstDayMonday bool` implies a simpler, hardcoded dichotomy between Monday/Sunday.

Since there is **no clear contextual signal** about which configuration mechanism should be used, **we cannot unequivocally determine which branch is more correct or up-to-date**.

Additionally, while the test expectations align (`"2013-11-18 00:00:00"`), and both changes attempt to switch to Monday as the first day, the coexistence of both configuration styles might point to a **period of transition or legacy vs refactored code**, which cannot be resolved safely without further context.

### âœ… Final Resolution

Given the ambiguity in **intent**, **code evolution**, and **behavioral precedence**, and per the instruction that *if the intent is ambiguous, the original conflict should be preserved* â€” it is most prudent to **return the snippet unchanged, preserving the conflict markers**.

```go
	assert(New(nDst).EndOfSunday(), "2017-10-29 23:59:59.999999999", "EndOfSunday DST")

	assert(New(n).BeginningOfWeek(), "2013-11-17 00:00:00", "BeginningOfWeek, FirstDayMonday")

<<<<<<< HEAD
	WeekStartDay = time.Monday
	if New(n).BeginningOfWeek().Format(format) != "2013-11-18 00:00:00" {
		t.Errorf("BeginningOfWeek, FirstDayMonday")
	}
=======
	FirstDayMonday = true
	assert(New(n).BeginningOfWeek(), "2013-11-18 00:00:00", "BeginningOfWeek, FirstDayMonday")
