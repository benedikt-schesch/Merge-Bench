The merge conflict in the import block indicates ambiguity regarding whether `github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/internal/casing` is necessary for the current package (`server`) in the HEAD or whether it should be removed as in the 0e11f6f8... branch.

Since the code snippet does not provide function bodies, variable usages, or any semantic details that clarify if the `casing` package is used, we cannot determine with certainty whether that import should be preserved or removed. The surrounding imports related to Protobuf don't help resolve this intent by themselves.

Thus, per the instructions, if the intent or usage is ambiguous, we must leave the merge conflict intact for further resolution by the developer with full context.

Here is the original unresolved code snippet, preserved exactly:

```go
package server

import (
	"strings"

<<<<<<< HEAD
	"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/internal/casing"
=======
>>>>>>> 0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6
	"google.golang.org/genproto/protobuf/field_mask"
	"google.golang.org/protobuf/proto"
	"google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect"
)
```
