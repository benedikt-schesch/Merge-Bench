The merge conflict in the provided Go code involves two versions of the `bindataFileInfo` struct initialization, differing only in the `modTime` timestamp.

When analyzing for semantic intent, both versions establish an `asset` object using the same:
- File path (`"conf/gitignore/SVN"`),
- File size (`6`),
- File mode (`os.FileMode(420)` / `-rw-r--r--`),
- Byte content fetched via `confGitignoreSvnBytes()`.

The only divergence lies in the `modTime` timestamp, where `HEAD` uses `1444419364` (corresponding roughly to October 2015) and the other side of the merge uses the later `1467390283` (July 2016).

This suggests that the change affects only the modification time of the file asset, likely to reflect when the physical file was last updatedâ€”common in asset generation tools. However, with no context as to which timestamp should prevail based on code changes or logical functionality of the application, the modification time serves more as metadata and carries no semantic impact on the asset structure itself.

Since the timestamp disparity is the sole conflicting element and no contextual guidance is given to determine precedence, **the ambiguity in semantic intent renders automatic resolution risky**. 

Therefore, the safest and most accurate approach under uncertainty is to **return the snippet with the original conflict markers intact**.

Here is the unchanged code with preserved spacing and formatting:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreSvnBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/SVN", size: 6, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info:  info}
=======
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/SVN", size: 6, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
>>>>>>> 73fedc727538381d4e1048ee03be6b45e977a076
	return a, nil
}
