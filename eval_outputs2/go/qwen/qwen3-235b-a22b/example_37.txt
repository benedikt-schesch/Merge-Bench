The only meaningful difference between the two versions is the `modTime` in the `bindataFileInfo` struct. This field typically stores the timestamp of when the asset was last modified. Since timestamp accuracy is important for identity or cache invalidation purposes, and assuming that newer versions of the file should reflect newer timestamps, the commit with the later Unix timestamp (`1467390283`) reflects a more recent file state. There is no semantic ambiguity in the difference of formatting (`info:  info` vs `info: info`), so it's acceptable to resolve with clean spacing in favor of code readability.

Here is the resolved code snippet with full context preserved and appropriate formatting and intent applied:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreEmacsBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Emacs", size: 320, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreEnsime = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x52\x56\x70\xcd\x2b\xce\xcc\x4d\x55\x28\x2e\x48\x4d\xce\x4c\xcb\x4c\xe6\xd2\x4b\x05\x0b\xc0\xe8\xf8\xe4\xc4\xe4\x8c\x54\x7d\x38\x37\xa7\x34\x39\x35\x0f\xc8\x07\x08\x00\x00\xff\xff\x9d\x93\x9f\xe6\x39\x00\x00\x00")
