The merge conflict presents a single line addition (`var _ = descriptor.ForMessage`) in the `HEAD` branch and a deletion or absence in the other side of the conflict. Since this is a semantic merge conflict and we are being asked to resolve it based on intent and semantics:

1. The line `var _ = descriptor.ForMessage` is a common Go idiom for importing or referencing a package for its side effects (such as initialization), even though the identifier itself is not used.  
2. Without further context such as whether the `descriptor` package is imported or used elsewhere, or what its role is in the program logic, we cannot definitively assert the correctness of keeping or removing this line.  

Given that the intent or impact of either change is ambiguous with the provided context, the appropriate resolution is to leave the merge conflict as-is.

```go
var _ codes.Code
var _ io.Reader
var _ status.Status
var _ = runtime.String
var _ = utilities.NewDoubleArray
<<<<<<< HEAD
var _ = descriptor.ForMessage

func request_ResponseBodyService_GetResponseBody_0(ctx context.Context, marshaler runtime.Marshaler, client ResponseBodyServiceClient, req *http.Request, pathParams map[string]string) (proto.Message, runtime.ServerMetadata, error) {

	var metadata runtime.ServerMetadata
