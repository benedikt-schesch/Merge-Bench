The resolution of merge conflicts in import statements requires ensuring all necessary packages are included while maintaining idempotence and consistency with the intended usage of the function.

Looking at the conflict:
- **`HEAD`** (local change): does not include `"sigs.k8s.io/krew/pkg/constants"`.
- **Incoming merge** adds: `"sigs.k8s.io/krew/pkg/constants"`.

The function body, `LoadPluginListFromFS`, is not fully visible, and there's no clear evidence in the snippet that it references `sigs.k8s.io/krew/pkg/constants`. This leaves the semantic intent ambiguous. Without confirmation that the constants package is used in the implementation, it is safer not to assume intent to keep or add it.

### âœ… Verdict: **Ambiguous Intent**
We must preserve the conflict marker because we cannot determine if the added import in one branch is necessary or whether the omission in the other is intentional.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict unresolved:

```go
	"strings"

	"github.com/golang/glog"
	"github.com/pkg/errors"
	"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/yaml"
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
	
	"sigs.k8s.io/krew/pkg/constants"
>>>>>>> 4b0255cb12aba19739d0c4f8ae84cc3eac22cabb
	"sigs.k8s.io/krew/pkg/index"
)

// LoadPluginListFromFS will parse and retrieve all plugin files.
func LoadPluginListFromFS(indexDir string) ([]index.Plugin, error) {
