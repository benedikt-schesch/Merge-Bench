The merge conflict arises from differing arguments in the `stern.Watch` function call. One version passes a slice of `stern.ContainerState` values (`[]stern.ContainerState{stern.RUNNING, stern.TERMINATED}`), while the other passes a single `stern.ContainerState` value (`stern.RUNNING`).

This appears to be a mismatch in semantic intent. The first version implies the `Watch` function should observe both **running** and **terminated** pod states. The second version appears to only care about the **running** state.

### Function Signature Ambiguity

Go does not allow mixing slices with single values as arguments unless the function is defined with a variadic parameter (`...`), which we cannot confirm from the given context. If `Watch` expects a slice, the second version is invalid, and if it expects a single `ContainerState`, then the first version is invalid.

Without knowledge of the updated function signature or its expected behavior, this cannot be resolved with certainty.

---

### Conclusion

Since the intent of both sides is semantically divergent and the actual function signature is unknown, the correct resolution is to leave the conflict marker intact as further clarification is needed from the developers involved.
