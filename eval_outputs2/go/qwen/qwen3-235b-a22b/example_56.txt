The merge conflict in the provided code snippet lies in the differing `modTime` values and a minor formatting difference in the initialization of the `asset` struct. Both branches initialize a `bindataFileInfo` object with identical field values—name, size, and mode—except for the `modTime`.

---

### Semantic Context

The key functional difference between the two versions is `modTime`, which denotes the last modification time of the file `"conf/gitignore/Nim"`. Since both branches differ on this field, resolving this conflict should be based on **which timestamp is semantically accurate** for the file *at this point in the codebase*.

- The `HEAD` section uses a Unix timestamp of `1444419364`, corresponding to **October 7, 2015** (approximately).
- The `73fedc7` section uses `1467390283`, corresponding to **July 1, 2016**.

Given that both timestamps are concrete and valid, the choice is ultimately semantic. However, in the absence of explicit advice, a reasonable assumption is that the **later timestamp represents a more recent and correct update** to the file. Thus, **July 1, 2016** (version from `73fedc7`) better aligns with what the file’s `modTime` should reflect if both branches dealt with file modification.

### Line by Line Decision

- **Line 1 (`info := bindataFileInfo...`)**: The earlier timestamp in HEAD (`1444419364`) is overridden by the later one from `73fedc7` (`1467390283`).
- **Line 2 (`a := &asset{...}`)**: The formatting difference (`info:  info` vs `info: info`) does not affect function and likely is the result of inconsistent formatting in the branches. Standard Go tooling like `gofmt` would eliminate this difference during post-merge cleanups; we choose the `73fedc7` version for consistency.

### Final Resolved Snippet

Here is the correctly merged result:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreNimBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Nim", size: 10, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreNinja = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xcb\xcb\xcc\xcb\x4a\x8c\x4f\x49\x2d\x28\xe6\x82\xb2\x73\xf2\xd3\xb9\x00\x01\x00\x00\xff\xff\xee\x9e\xc8\x72\x17\x00\x00\x00")
```

This result respects both semantic meaning and functional integrity, while choosing the more recent `modTime` based on human intuition and plausible code evolution pathways in the absence of clear authoritative context.
