The merge conflict in the provided Go code snippet arises from a difference in the `modTime` value assigned to the `bindataFileInfo` struct. Both branches of the merge aim to create an asset containing the `Ada` gitignore configuration data, with identical values for the name, size, and file mode. The only difference is in the timestamp used for `modTime`.

---

### Key Observations:

- The function `confGitignoreAdaBytes()` is used to retrieve the `bytes` for the asset. Since its implementation is not included in the snippet, we assume it's consistent across both branches.
- All fields except `modTime` are identical, indicating that the core intent — returning a valid asset with a defined metadata object (`info`) — is preserved in both versions.
- The differing `modTime` values:
  - `HEAD`: `time.Unix(1444419364, 0)` → **2015-10-08**
  - `73fedc7...`: `time.Unix(1467390283, 0)` → **2016-07-02**

These timestamps represent different points in time but do not clarify if they were programmatically derived from an original file or hardcoded for consistency.

---

### Intent and Ambiguity

The semantic intent across both versions is to:

- Load raw bytes via a function
- Construct metadata (name, size, mode, modTime)
- Return the `asset` struct

Both fulfill this intent; however, the `modTime` values diverge in their specific values without clear rationale provided by context or function implementation. Without understanding why the file’s last modified time is important (e.g. for cache invalidation, build systems, etc.), choosing between the two timestamps is speculative.

---

### Decision

Due to the ambiguity and the fact that both versions fulfill the intended functionality with only a timestamp difference, **the conflict remains unresolved** due to unclear intent.

---

### Final Output (Conflict Preserved)
