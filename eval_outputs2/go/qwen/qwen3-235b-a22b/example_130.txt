The merge conflict involves two equivalent types, `*descriptor.MethodDescriptorProto` (older) and `*descriptorpb.MethodDescriptorProto` (newer), from different Go protobuf versions. Resolving this conflict requires determining which package the rest of the codebase uses for compatibility.

---

### Analysis

- The `*descriptor.MethodDescriptorProto` comes from the legacy `github.com/golang/protobuf/descriptor` package used with older versions of Go gRPC and gRPC-Gateway codebases.
- The `*descriptorpb.MethodDescriptorProto` comes from the newer `google.golang.org/protobuf/types/descriptorpb` package, used in newer Protobuf versions and modern gRPC codebases.

The `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway` project and its internal code structure suggests that this file likely belongs to a version transition or refactoring where the newer `descriptorpb` is preferred.

Additionally, the file path in the merge conflict:
- `HEAD:protoc-gen-grpc-gateway/descriptor/services.go`
- `branch:internal/descriptor/services.go`

indicates a refactoring or internal package reorganization, further supporting the use of `descriptorpb`.

---

### Semantic Intent

The semantic intent is **to define a function that takes a method descriptor and computes an HTTP mapping** (`HttpRule`) consistent with the service and method definitions.

Both sides of the conflict aim to do exactly this. Therefore, the resolution depends on **which `MethodDescriptorProto` type is used consistently elsewhere** in the code. However, given the modern codebase structure and naming (`descriptorpb`), it‚Äôs safe to assume the code is using the newer protobuf APIs.

---

### Resolution

The correct resolution is to **keep the `descriptorpb.MethodDescriptorProto` version**, which matches the modern Protobuf type used in updated gRPC and proto toolchains.

Here's the resolved code with the conflict removed and the modern type in place:

```go
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("extension is %T; want an HttpRule", ext)
	}
	return opts, nil
}

func defaultAPIOptions(svc *Service, md *descriptorpb.MethodDescriptorProto) (*options.HttpRule, error) {
	// FQSN prefixes the service's full name with a '.', e.g.: '.example.ExampleService'
	fqsn := strings.TrimPrefix(svc.FQSN(), ".")

	// This generates an HttpRule that matches the gRPC mapping to HTTP/2 described in
	// https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md#requests
```
