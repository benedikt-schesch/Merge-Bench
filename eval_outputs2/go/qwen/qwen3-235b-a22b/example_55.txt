The merge conflict arises from a difference in the `modTime` value in a `bindataFileInfo` struct. Both sides of the conflict are functionally identical except for the specific timestamp, which does not significantly impact the runtime logic or the integrity of the data (as both are referencing the same file content via `confGitignoreNetbeansBytes()`). 

Given this, both timestamps could potentially reflect different build or generation times of the file at the point of each branchâ€™s last commit, but semantically, there is no clear indication from this isolated context as to which timestamp corresponds to the most accurate or intended modification time of the source asset.

Since the intent behind which timestamp should be preserved is ambiguous without deeper historical or functional justification, and given the instructions, **the merge conflict should not be resolved automatically**.

Here is the snippet as originally provided, with the merge conflict preserved:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreNetbeansBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/NetBeans", size: 96, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info:  info}
=======
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/NetBeans", size: 96, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
>>>>>>> 73fedc727538381d4e1048ee03be6b45e977a076
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreNim = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xca\xcb\xcc\x4d\x4e\x4c\xce\x48\xd5\xe7\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x6e\x5e\xa9\x72\x0a\x00\x00\x00")
