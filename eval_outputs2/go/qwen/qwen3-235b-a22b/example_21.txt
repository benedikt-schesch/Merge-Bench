The intent on both sides of the merge is to return a correctly initialized `asset` instance representing a `VisualStudio` gitignore file. The main difference between the two versions lies in the `modTime` field of the `bindataFileInfo` struct, with one timestamp (`1444419364`) and another (`1467390283`). Both timestamps appear to be valid, but no additional context is provided about the meaning or significance of either modification time.

Additionally, there is a minor whitespace difference in the `asset` struct initialization: `info:  info` with two spaces (likely an error or formatting artifact) versus `info: info` with one space. However, in Go, struct literal initialization doesn't distinguish between the two in terms of functionality, and such minor whitespace differences generally reflect code formatting tools or human typing habits rather than core logic intent.

---

Given this lack of clear intent or justification for selecting one `modTime` over the other, and the ambiguity of whether one side is more up-to-date or semantically correct, resolving the conflict would require external information or clarification. Since no such guidance is given and the conflict involves time metadata that may reflect external state (such as the fileâ€™s last modification timestamp in generated code), the safest and most semantically neutral action is to preserve the conflict markers as-is.

Therefore, the conflict remains unresolved and is returned in its original state as instructed.
