The provided merge conflict can be clearly observed in the `modTime` value assigned to the `bindataFileInfo` struct. Both versions of the code are semantically identical in all other respects — struct definitions, variable assignments (except for justified whitespace differences around the colon), and overall functionality.

---

The `info` struct contains metadata used to represent a specific file "conf/gitignore/LabVIEW" and is passed to the `asset` struct. Here's a breakdown of what changes:

```go
<<<<<<< HEAD
	info := bindataFileInfo{..., modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info:  info}
=======
	info := bindataFileInfo{..., modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
>>>>>>> 73fedc7
```

The only difference lies in the timestamp (`1444419364` vs `1467390283`). These Unix timestamps represent dates:

- `1444419364` ≈ October 09, 2015 06:36:04 UTC
- `1467390283` ≈ July 02, 2016 16:24:43 UTC

This suggests a simple update to the last modification time of the file, possibly implying that the file content was updated in one of the branches. However, without context as to which version of the file was last modified, or whether the mod time should reflect a specific event or source, the correct value remains ambiguous.

---

The spacing difference (`info:  info` vs `info: info`) has no impact on Go parsing and is likely just formatting variation, not semantic or functional.

---

Since the intent is **semantically ambiguous** — we cannot be certain which `modTime` (and thus which version of the file's metadata) should be preserved — the best course of action is to **leave the conflict unresolved** and return the entire snippet as-is with appropriate conflict markers.

### Resolution:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreLabviewBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/LabVIEW", size: 142, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info:  info}
=======
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/LabVIEW", size: 142, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
>>>>>>> 73fedc727538381d4e1048ee03be6b45e977a076
	return a, nil
}
