The merge conflict in the provided code snippet involves the removal of a block of commented code in `HEAD` versus the retention and commenting out of the same code in the `b4883fe54e2b06602fc05c2787487d71b9353301` branch.

---

The code that was deleted in `HEAD` appears to be handling cookie attributes such as `Secure`, `MaxAge`, and `Expires`. These may have been intentionally commented (rather than removed) in the branch to disable functionality while still preserving the code for debugging, testing, or future use.

Given the lack of explicit commentary on which changeset better aligns with the current project goals, and no semantic differentiation between the actions of deletion versus commenting in the given context, **the intent remains ambiguous**. 

In such a case, according to your instruction:

> *If you are not sure on how to resolve the conflict or if the intent is ambiguous, please return the same snippet with the conflict.*

---

### âœ… Resolution: Return the same snippet with the conflict preserved.
