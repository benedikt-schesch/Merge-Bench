I'll resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intent and semantics of both sides. The conflict is about a minor formatting difference with no functional impact.

```go
	if !ok {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "missing parameter %s", "uint64Val")
	}

	protoReq.Uint64Val, err = runtime.UInt64Value(val)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "type mismatch, parameter: %s, error: %v", "uint64Val", err)
	}

	if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. Both branches contain identical functional code for the error handling
2. The only difference is an empty line after the assignment in HEAD
3. The surrounding context shows no extra vertical spacing in similar error checks
4. Removing the empty line maintains consistency with the code style
5. Semantically identical - both versions will behave exactly the same at runtime

The resolved version keeps the more compact formatting while preserving all functionality. This maintains consistency with the surrounding error handling patterns.
