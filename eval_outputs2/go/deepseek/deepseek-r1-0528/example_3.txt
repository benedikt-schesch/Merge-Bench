The conflict arises from differing import declarations between the two branches. The HEAD branch includes `"errors"` and `"flag"`, while the other branch omits them. Since these are standard library packages likely used elsewhere in the codebase, and their absence would break functionality if required, the safe resolution is to preserve both imports. 

The resolved snippet combines the imports from both branches:

```go
package endless

import (
	"crypto/tls"
	"errors"
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net"
	"net/http"
	"os"
```
