Here's the resolved snippet preserving context and spacing:

```go
// Code generated by protoc-gen-go. DO NOT EDIT.
// versions:
// 	protoc-gen-go v1.25.0
// 	protoc        v3.12.0
// source: examples/internal/helloworld/helloworld.proto

package helloworld

import (
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. The conflict occurs in generated file metadata comments
2. Both sides share the "Code generated..." line
3. The incoming branch adds version information comments
4. Version comments are non-functional metadata that don't affect code behavior
5. Preserving version information is beneficial for tracking generation tools
6. The solution maintains the HEAD's "DO NOT EDIT" line while incorporating the useful version metadata from the other branch
7. No ambiguity exists since the additions are complementary comments

The resolution keeps all relevant information while maintaining the integrity of the generated file header.
