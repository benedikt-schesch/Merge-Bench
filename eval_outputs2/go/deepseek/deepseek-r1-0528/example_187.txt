```go

	"github.com/fatih/color"
)

const (
	VERSION = "2.4.2"
)

func putAsciiArt(s string) {
	for _, c := range s {
		d := string(c)
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
Both sides of the conflict are setting a version constant, but with different values (`2.4.2` vs `2.4.1`). Since version numbers are typically incremented in newer changes, and `HEAD` (current branch) contains the higher version (`2.4.2` > `2.4.1`), this likely represents the most recent version update. The semantic intent is to declare the current version, so we retain `HEAD`'s value as it supersedes the older value from the other branch.
