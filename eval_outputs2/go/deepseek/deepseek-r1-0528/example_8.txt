The conflict arises from an assignment to `ev.esc` present in the HEAD branch but absent in the other branch (`a221f2f`). The surrounding context shows both branches handle bracketed paste termination identically except for this field assignment. 

Since the `esc` field assignment appears to be a HEAD-specific enhancement (likely related to escape sequence handling) and the other branch's version doesn't include this field, the semantics are incompatible without additional context. The intent is ambiguous because:
1. The `escseq` variable isn't defined in the provided snippet
2. The `EventPaste` struct definition isn't visible
3. There's no indication if the field is required for core functionality

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```go
		// The bracketed paste has started
		if strings.HasSuffix(str, "\x1b[201~") {
			// The bracketed paste has ended
			// Strip out the start and end sequences
			ev := NewEventPaste(str[6 : len(b)-6])
<<<<<<< HEAD
			ev.esc = escseq
=======
>>>>>>> a221f2faf4f9a059c8eba8f91c5d0dbd9845a985
			t.PostEvent(ev)
			for i := 0; i < len(b); i++ {
				buf.ReadByte()
			}
			return true, true

```
