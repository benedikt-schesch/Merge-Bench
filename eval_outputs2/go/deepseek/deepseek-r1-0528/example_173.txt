The conflict involves different parameters passed to the `recordMessage` function. The HEAD version uses 7 parameters, while the incoming branch uses 10 parameters including `logStr`, `reqTimestampMock`, and `logger`. Since `reqTimestampMock` is not present in the surrounding context and its availability in the HEAD branch is ambiguous, I cannot safely resolve this conflict. The intent appears to be adding more debugging/timing information in the incoming branch, but without knowing if `reqTimestampMock` exists in the current context, this might break the HEAD functionality.

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```go
				if i == 0 && isHeartBeat(opReq, *mongoRequests[0].Header, mongoRequests[0].Message, logger) {
					go func() {
						// Recover from panic and gracefully shutdown
						defer h.Recover(pkg.GenerateRandomID())
						defer utils.HandlePanic()
<<<<<<< HEAD
						recordMessage(h, requestBuffer, responseBuffer, mongoRequests, mongoResponses, opReq, ctx)
=======
						recordMessage(h, requestBuffer, responseBuffer, logStr, mongoRequests, mongoResponses, opReq, ctx, reqTimestampMock, logger)
>>>>>>> 7d20443551e8827b2d4cf431a63d30a5d3a16091
					}()
				}
				started = time.Now()
				responseBuffer, err = util.ReadBytes(destConn)
				// logStr += tmpStr

```
