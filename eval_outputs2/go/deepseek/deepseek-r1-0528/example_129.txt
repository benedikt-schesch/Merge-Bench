The conflict arises from a minor whitespace difference in the conditional check. Both branches intend to check the same `r.warnOnUnboundMethods` flag with identical logic. The only difference is an extra space after `if` in the HEAD version. Since the semantics are identical and the formatting difference is trivial, the conflict is resolved by adopting the conventional single-space formatting.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```go
						return err
					}
					optsList = append(optsList, defaultOpts)
				} else {
					logFn := glog.V(1).Infof
					if r.warnOnUnboundMethods {
						logFn = glog.Warningf
					}
					logFn("No HttpRule found for method: %s.%s", svc.GetName(), md.GetName())
				}
			}

```
