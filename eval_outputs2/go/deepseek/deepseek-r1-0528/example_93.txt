Based on the semantic analysis of both changes, here's the resolved version preserving the context while maintaining the intended functionality:

```go
	jsonContents, err := yaml.YAMLToJSON(yamlFileContents)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to convert gRPC API Configuration from YAML in '%v' to JSON: %v", yamlSourceLogName, err)
	}

	// As our GrpcAPIService is incomplete, accept unknown fields.
	unmarshaler := protojson.UnmarshalOptions{
		DiscardUnknown: true,
	}

	serviceConfiguration := apiconfig.GrpcAPIService{}
	if err := unmarshaler.Unmarshal(jsonContents, &serviceConfiguration); err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to parse gRPC API Configuration from YAML in '%v': %v", yamlSourceLogName, err)
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. The `protojson` package (from the other branch) is the modern Protobuf JSON implementation and should be preferred over the deprecated `jsonpb`
2. `DiscardUnknown: true` achieves the same semantic intent as `AllowUnknownFields: true` (ignoring unrecognized fields)
3. The improved comment clarity from the other branch ("incomplete,") was preserved
4. Both solutions functionally handle unknown fields during unmarshaling
5. The `protojson` version is more future-proof and aligns with current Protobuf best practices

The resolution maintains the core functionality both branches were attempting to achieve (ignoring unknown fields during JSON unmarshaling) while using the modern API and clearer comment.
