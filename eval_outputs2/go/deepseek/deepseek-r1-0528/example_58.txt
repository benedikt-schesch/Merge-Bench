```go
	NewMigration("generate and migrate Git hooks", generateAndMigrateGitHooks),
	// v15 -> v16:v0.10.16
	NewMigration("update repository sizes", updateRepositorySizes),
	// v16 -> v17:v0.10.31
	NewMigration("remove invalid protect branch whitelist", removeInvalidProtectBranchWhitelist),
	// v17 -> v18:v0.11.48
	NewMigration("store long text in repository description field", updateRepositoryDescriptionField),
	// v18 -> v19:v0.11.55
	NewMigration("clean unlinked webhook and hook_tasks", cleanUnlinkedWebhookAndHookTasks),
}

// Migrate database to current version
func Migrate(x *xorm.Engine) error {
	if err := x.Sync(new(Version)); err != nil {
```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
The conflict occurred between two sequential database migrations:
1. HEAD adds migration `v17->v18` (description field update)
2. Other branch adds migration `v18->v19` (webhook cleanup)

Since these represent consecutive version upgrades, both migrations are necessary and should be preserved in chronological order. The resolution:
1. Keeps both migrations
2. Maintains version sequence: v17->v18 first, then v18->v19
3. Preserves all comments and formatting
4. Removes merge conflict markers

This maintains database migration integrity by applying schema changes in the correct order. Both features (description storage improvement and webhook cleanup) are independent and complementary.
