The conflict arises from differing type declarations for `bufferedSends` (`interface{}` vs `any`) and comment alignment. Since `any` is the modern Go alias for `interface{}` and both versions agree on the `wasClosedSend` field, we resolve by:

1. Using `any` for type consistency with modern Go
2. Preserving HEAD's comment alignment style
3. Maintaining identical field names and other struct elements

Resolved snippet:
```go
// type serverStreamingRetryingStream is the implementation of grpc.ClientStream that acts as a
// proxy to the underlying call. If any of the RecvMsg() calls fail, it will try to reestablish
// a new ClientStream according to the retry policy.
type serverStreamingRetryingStream struct {
	grpc.ClientStream
	bufferedSends []any         // single message that the client can sen
	wasClosedSend bool          // indicates that CloseSend was closed
	parentCtx     context.Context
	callOpts      *options
	streamerCall  func(ctx context.Context) (grpc.ClientStream, error)
	mu            sync.RWMutex
}
```
