Based on the semantic equivalence of `any` and `interface{}` in Go (since Go 1.18), I recommend keeping `any` as it's more concise while maintaining identical functionality. Here's the resolved snippet:

```go
		}
	}
	return lastErr
}

func (s *serverStreamingRetryingStream) receiveMsgAndIndicateRetry(m any) (bool, error) {
	err := s.getStream().RecvMsg(m)
	if err == nil || err == io.EOF {
		return false, err
	}
	if isContextError(err) {
```

Key resolution points:
1. `any` is a built-in alias for `interface{}` in Go ([specification reference](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Interface_types))
2. Both versions are semantically identical
3. `any` is preferred in modern Go code for better readability
4. The function behavior remains unchanged
5. File path differences in conflict markers are irrelevant to code functionality and were removed per merge conflict resolution standards

The resolution maintains:
- Identical functionality
- Go best practices
- Context spacing and formatting
- Semantic intent of both branches
