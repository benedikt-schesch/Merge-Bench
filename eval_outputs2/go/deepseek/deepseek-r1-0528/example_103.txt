Based on the semantic analysis, I've resolved the conflict by preserving the method name parameter which provides additional context for gRPC Gateway routing. Here's the resolved code:

```go
		ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(req.Context())
		defer cancel()
		var stream runtime.ServerTransportStream
		ctx = grpc.NewContextWithServerTransportStream(ctx, &stream)
		inboundMarshaler, outboundMarshaler := runtime.MarshalerForRequest(mux, req)
		rctx, err := runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext(ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello")
		if err != nil {
			runtime.HTTPError(ctx, mux, outboundMarshaler, w, req, err)
			return
		}
		resp, md, err := local_request_Greeter_SayHello_1(rctx, inboundMarshaler, server, req, pathParams)
```

Key resolution points:
1. The full method path `/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello` provides explicit routing information for the gRPC Gateway
2. This matches the called method `local_request_Greeter_SayHello_1`
3. Newer versions of gRPC Gateway require this parameter for proper context annotation
4. The method name doesn't conflict with surrounding functionality
5. All other context is preserved exactly as provided

The resolved version maintains both the functional integrity of the HEAD branch and the improved specificity of the incoming branch.
