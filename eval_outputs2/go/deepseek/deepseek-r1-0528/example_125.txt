```go
	"errors"
	"mime"
	"net/http"

	"google.golang.org/grpc/grpclog"
	"google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson"
)

// MIMEWildcard is the fallback MIME type used for requests which do not match
// a registered MIME type.
const MIMEWildcard = "*"
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. Both branches are adding independent imports - they don't conflict semantically
2. The HEAD branch (`grpclog`) provides logging functionality
3. The other branch (`protojson`) adds Protobuf JSON support
4. These imports serve different purposes and can coexist
5. The resolution maintains both functionalities by preserving both imports
6. Context before/after conflict markers remains unchanged

The merge is safe because:
- No overlapping functionality between imports
- Both are required for different features
- Alphabetical order matches original style
- No duplication of packages
