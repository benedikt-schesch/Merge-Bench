The conflict involves two changes to the import block:
1. **HEAD branch** adds `"os"` import and uses `"net/mail"` without an alias
2. **Other branch** aliases `"net/mail"` as `stdmail` but doesn't include `"os"`

The resolution requires combining both changes since:
- `"os"` is needed by HEAD changes
- The alias `stdmail` is required by the other branch
- Both changes are semantically compatible

Here's the resolved version:

```go

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	stdmail "net/mail"
	"os"
)

// Sender is the interface that wraps the Send method.
//
// Send sends an email to the given addresses.

```

Key resolution points:
1. Maintained `stdmail` alias from other branch
2. Preserved `"os"` import from HEAD branch
3. Kept original import order (aliased package before `"os"`)
4. Maintained exact spacing and context around the import block
5. Both semantic requirements are satisfied:
   - Mail package remains accessible via `stdmail`
   - `os` package remains available for file operations
