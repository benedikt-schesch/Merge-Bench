Here's the code snippet with the conflict preserved since the intent is ambiguous:

```go

	viper.AutomaticEnv()
}

func initGitConfig() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
	setRootPath()
=======
	setRootPath(rootExecutionRelPath)
>>>>>>> 491b8436429d0457828901831e2c6c6d758a4d60
	setGitHooksPath(getHooksPathFromGitConfig())
}

func getRootPath() string {
	return rootPath

```

### Reasoning:
1. **Ambiguous Intent**: The conflict shows two different signatures for `setRootPath()` - one without arguments and one with `rootExecutionRelPath`. Without knowing:
   - The implementation details of `setRootPath`
   - The definition/scope of `rootExecutionRelPath`
   - Which branch introduced the newer logic
   It's impossible to determine the correct version.

2. **Potential Incompatibility**: The two versions suggest different approaches to setting the root path. They could represent:
   - A breaking API change in `setRootPath`
   - Different initialization requirements in each branch
   - Incompatible project states

3. **Semantic Uncertainty**: The surrounding context shows `getRootPath()` uses a global variable, but doesn't clarify:
   - How `rootPath` gets initialized
   - Whether `rootExecutionRelPath` exists in both branches
   - Which approach correctly initializes the state for `setGitHooksPath`

4. **Preservation Required**: Since we can't verify:
   - If `rootExecutionRelPath` is defined in the HEAD branch
   - Why the parameter was added/removed
   - Which version satisfies both branches' requirements
   The conflict must be preserved for manual resolution.
