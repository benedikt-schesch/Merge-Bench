I'll return the code snippet exactly as provided since the intent behind the conflicting changes is ambiguous. Here's the original snippet with the merge conflict preserved:

```go
var _ codes.Code
var _ io.Reader
var _ status.Status
var _ = runtime.String
var _ = utilities.NewDoubleArray
<<<<<<< HEAD
var _ = descriptor.ForMessage
=======
>>>>>>> 0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6
var _ = metadata.Join

func request_StreamService_BulkCreate_0(ctx context.Context, marshaler runtime.Marshaler, client StreamServiceClient, req *http.Request, pathParams map[string]string) (proto.Message, runtime.ServerMetadata, error) {
	var metadata runtime.ServerMetadata
	stream, err := client.BulkCreate(ctx)
```

The conflict centers around whether to include `var _ = descriptor.ForMessage`. Without additional context about why this line was added in HEAD and removed in the other branch, I can't determine:
1. If `descriptor.ForMessage` is still needed for proper functionality
2. If this relates to import side effects or interface satisfaction
3. Whether this was an intentional removal vs cleanup

Since both changes appear to be modifying the same location for potentially valid but unclear reasons, I'm preserving the conflict for manual resolution.
