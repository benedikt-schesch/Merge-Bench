```

The conflict remains unresolved as the intent is ambiguous. Both branches appear to be defining the same configuration option for update masking, but use different field names (`UpdateMaskPaths` vs `UpdateMask`). Without additional context about:
1. How these fields are used in the function implementation
2. Which name better reflects the purpose
3. Compatibility requirements with other parts of the codebase

It's impossible to determine the correct resolution. The field names suggest:
- `UpdateMask` implies a general field mask
- `UpdateMaskPaths` suggests specific paths to update

Since the function body isn't provided and we can't verify usage, preserving the conflict markers is the safest approach.
