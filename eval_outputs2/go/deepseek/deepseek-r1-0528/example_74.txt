```go

package proto

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"reflect"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
	"sync"


```

The conflict arises from one branch adding the `"log"` import while the other branch doesn't. Since both changes are additive and don't conflict semantically, the proper resolution is to preserve both imports. The `"log"` package should be included along with the other imports as it appears to be intentionally added functionality that doesn't interfere with existing imports.

The resolution:
1. Keeps `"fmt"` from the HEAD branch
2. Adds `"log"` from the other branch
3. Preserves all other imports (`reflect`, `strconv`, `strings`, `sync`)
4. Maintains the original formatting and empty lines

This satisfies both changes: the original import set is preserved while adding the new logging capability from the other branch.
