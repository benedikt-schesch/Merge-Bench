The conflict arises from one branch adding the `RequesterPays` field while the other branch doesn't modify that section. Since these changes are additive and non-conflicting at the semantic level, the resolution is to include the new field while preserving all existing fields. Here's the resolved snippet:

```go
	// S3
	Endpoint       string
	Region         string
	RegionSet      bool
	StorageClass   string
	RequesterPays  bool
	AccessKey      string
	SecretKey      string
	Profile        string
	UseContentType bool
	UseSSE         bool

```

**Resolution rationale:**  
1. The `RequesterPays` field (from the incoming branch) is added after `StorageClass` since it represents new functionality
2. All original fields (`AccessKey`, `SecretKey`, etc.) are preserved in their original order
3. The field alignment and comments remain unchanged
4. This maintains backward compatibility while adding new configuration capability

The conflict is resolved by incorporating both changes since they're semantically compatible - the new field doesn't interfere with existing fields' meanings or usage.
