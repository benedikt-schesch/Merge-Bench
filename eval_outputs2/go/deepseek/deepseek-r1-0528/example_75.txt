The conflict arises from two different approaches to iterating over network interfaces and storing references. Both versions aim to avoid the common Go pitfall of capturing a loop variable's address by creating a local copy. The semantic intent is identical - only the variable naming differs. 

The resolution uses the HEAD version since it consistently uses the `iface` variable name for both storing the interface reference and subsequent operations, improving code readability. The other branch's `t` variable adds unnecessary indirection.

```go
	sort.Sort(rtr.v6)
	ifaces, err := net.Interfaces()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	for _, tmp := range ifaces {
		iface := tmp
		rtr.ifaces[iface.Index] = &iface
		var addrs ipAddrs
		ifaceAddrs, err := iface.Addrs()
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
```
