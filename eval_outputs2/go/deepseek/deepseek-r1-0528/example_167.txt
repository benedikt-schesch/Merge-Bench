```

The conflict remains unresolved due to ambiguity in version source selection. Both changes attempt to set `tel.KeployVersion` but reference different variables (`utils.VersionForTelemetry` vs `utils.KeployVersion`). Since the semantic difference between these variables isn't clear from the context, and both appear to serve similar purposes for telemetry versioning, manual resolution is required to determine:  
1. If these variables represent different versioning schemes  
2. Which one is appropriate for this telemetry context  
3. Whether they should be consolidated in the `utils` package  

The surrounding context remains unchanged as requested.
