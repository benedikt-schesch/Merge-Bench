I'll help resolve this semantic merge conflict while preserving the context exactly. Here's the analysis:

The conflict involves two changes:
1. Different timestamps for `modTime` (1444419364 vs 1467390283)
2. Minor whitespace difference in `info:  info` vs `info: info`

Since timestamps represent different points in time and there's no context to determine which is correct, this is ambiguous. Both changes are semantically valid but conflicting. According to your instructions, when intent is ambiguous, we should preserve the conflict.

Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```go
	bytes, err := confReadmeDefaultBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/readme/Default", size: 23, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info:  info}
=======
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/readme/Default", size: 23, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
>>>>>>> 73fedc727538381d4e1048ee03be6b45e977a076
	return a, nil
}

// Asset loads and returns the asset for the given name.
// It returns an error if the asset could not be found or
