Here's the resolved snippet with the first conflict addressed. The `standalone` field from the other branch has been added while preserving the blank line separation for the commented `warnOnUnboundMethods` field. The second conflict remains unresolved since its intent is ambiguous without more context.

```go

	// simpleOperationIDs removes the service prefix from the generated
	// operationIDs. This risks generating duplicate operationIDs.
	simpleOperationIDs bool

	standalone bool

	// warnOnUnboundMethods causes the registry to emit warning logs if an RPC method
	// has no HttpRule annotation.
	warnOnUnboundMethods bool

<<<<<<< HEAD:protoc-gen-grpc-gateway/descriptor/registry.go

```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Both branches add configuration flags (`standalone` and `warnOnUnboundMethods`)
2. The fields are semantically independent (no logical overlap)
3. Added `standalone bool` from the other branch between existing fields
4. Preserved blank line before `warnOnUnboundMethods` for comment separation
5. Kept the second conflict marker since its context is incomplete/ambiguous

The trailing conflict marker remains as its resolution requires additional context not provided in the snippet.
