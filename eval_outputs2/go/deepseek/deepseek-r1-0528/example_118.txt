The conflict arises from a blank line difference between the two branches. Both versions have identical functionality for the error handling block. The blank line after the assignment in HEAD is purely stylistic and doesn't affect program behavior. Since the other branch's version without the blank line is more concise and aligns with common Go conventions, I've resolved the conflict by removing the blank line.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```go
	if !ok {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "missing parameter %s", "bytesVal")
	}

	protoReq.BytesVal, err = runtime.BytesValue(val)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "type mismatch, parameter: %s, error: %v", "bytesVal", err)
	}

	if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {
```
