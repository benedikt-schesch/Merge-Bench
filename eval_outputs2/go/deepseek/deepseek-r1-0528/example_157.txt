The conflict arises from differing version numbers in the `CurrentVersionNumber` constant. Since both branches are defining the same constant with different values, and without additional context about the release cycle or development stage, it's impossible to determine which version is correct. The conflict markers must be preserved for manual resolution.

Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```go

// CurrentCommit is the current git commit, this is set as a ldflag in the Makefile.
var CurrentCommit string

// CurrentVersionNumber is the current application's version literal.
<<<<<<< HEAD
const CurrentVersionNumber = "0.35.0"
=======
const CurrentVersionNumber = "0.36.0-dev"
>>>>>>> 46b2e60c9f542a94b9922a90b9a329d19c39509a

const ApiVersion = "/kubo/" + CurrentVersionNumber + "/" //nolint

// GetUserAgentVersion is the libp2p user agent used by go-ipfs.
//
