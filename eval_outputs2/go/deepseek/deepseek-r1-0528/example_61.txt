**Resolution rationale:**  
The conflict involves two different equality checks for protocol buffer objects. The semantic choice depends on proper protobuf comparison practices. 

1. `reflect.DeepEqual(*ext, want)` (HEAD version) compares struct values directly
2. `proto.Equal(ext, &want)` (branch version) uses protobuf's recommended comparison

The resolution chooses `proto.Equal` because:
- It's specifically designed for protobuf semantics (handles internal fields/optimizations)
- Works correctly with both `ext` (pointer) and `&want` (address of struct)
- Maintains consistency with the error message which uses pointer values (`ext` and `&want`)
- Aligns with best practices for protocol buffer equality checks

The context shows `want` is a struct value (since `&want` is used in the error message), making `proto.Equal(ext, &want)` the semantically correct choice that satisfies both intents: proper value comparison while handling protobuf-specific semantics.
