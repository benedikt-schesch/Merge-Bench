				ck.Domain, _ = p.replaceHostWithPhished(ck.Domain)
				resp.Header.Add("Set-Cookie", ck.String())

			if ck.String() != "" {
				resp.Header.Add("Set-Cookie", ck.String())
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
The conflict involves commented-out code on one branch vs. no code on the other. Since:
1. The commented lines are inactive and functionally inert
2. The HEAD branch explicitly removed these lines (likely as cleanup)
3. The surrounding logic focuses on cookie manipulation without dependencies on these comments  

The clean resolution is to accept the HEAD version (no commented code), maintaining current behavior while reducing clutter. The commented code appears to be obsolete debugging/experimentation artifacts.
