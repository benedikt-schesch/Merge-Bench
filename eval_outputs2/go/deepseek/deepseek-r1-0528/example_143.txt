```go
	}

	// Check for cyclical message reference:
	isCycle := touchedIn[*msg.Name]
	if isCycle {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("recursive types are not allowed for query parameters, cycle found on %q", fieldType)
	}

	// Construct a new map with the message name so a cycle further down the recursive path can be detected.
	// Do not keep anything in the original touched reference and do not pass that reference along.  This will
	// prevent clobbering adjacent records while recursing.

```

Reasoning:
1. The semantic intent is identical - both versions report a recursive type error with the same message structure
2. The only difference is capitalization of "recursive" (HEAD uses uppercase, merging branch uses lowercase)
3. Go convention prefers lowercase for error strings (as seen in standard library)
4. The lowercase version maintains consistency with typical Go error formatting
5. The file path differences in conflict markers are irrelevant for semantic resolution
6. No ambiguity exists since both versions convey identical meaning

The resolution preserves the functional behavior while adhering to Go style conventions.
