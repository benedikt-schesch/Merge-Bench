I'll resolve this merge conflict by preserving the intent of both branches. The conflict involves adding fields to a struct initialization. Both branches add a `Created` field, while the second branch also adds two additional timestamp fields. 

Here's the resolved code:

```go
				HttpResp: &kModels.HttpResp{
					StatusCode: respParsed.StatusCode,
					Header:     pkg.ToYamlHttpHeader(respParsed.Header),
					Body:       string(respBody),
				},
				Created:          time.Now().Unix(),
				ReqTimestampMock: reqTimestampMock,
				ResTimestampMock: resTimestampcMock,
			},
		}, ctx)
		finalReq = []byte("")
		finalResp = []byte("")


```

Resolution reasoning:
1. Kept the `Created` field from both branches (identical value)
2. Added the two new fields (`ReqTimestampMock` and `ResTimestampMock`) from the second branch
3. Maintained consistent field alignment using the spacing from the second branch
4. Preserved all surrounding context exactly as provided

The solution combines both changes since they add complementary fields to the struct initialization. The timestamp fields appear to be related to mock functionality while `Created` seems to be a general timestamp, so all can coexist without conflict.
