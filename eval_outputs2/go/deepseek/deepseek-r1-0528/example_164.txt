Based on the provided context, the merge conflict arises in the `MODE_TEST` case block. Here's the resolution:

1. Both branches are trying to call `decodePostgresOutgoing` in `MODE_TEST`
2. The HEAD version correctly uses the receiver's `hooks` and `logger` fields (`p.hooks`, `p.logger`)
3. The other branch uses undefined variables (`h` and `logger`) which aren't in scope
4. The receiver's fields are used consistently in both `MODE_RECORD` and the default case

Resolved version preserving all context:

```go
func(p *PostgresParser) ProcessOutgoing(requestBuffer []byte, clientConn, destConn net.Conn, ctx context.Context) {
	switch models.GetMode() {
	case models.MODE_RECORD:
		encodePostgresOutgoing(requestBuffer, clientConn, destConn, p.hooks, p.logger, ctx)
	case models.MODE_TEST:
		decodePostgresOutgoing(requestBuffer, clientConn, destConn, p.hooks, p.logger, ctx)
	default:
		p.logger.Info("Invalid mode detected while intercepting outgoing http call", zap.Any("mode", models.GetMode()))
	}

}
```
