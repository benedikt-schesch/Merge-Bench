The conflict involves the `Del` method definition. The HEAD version uses `NiceMD` as the receiver type and lowercases the key, while the incoming version uses `MD` and processes the key with `encodeKeyValue`. Since these represent different types in different packages (`NiceMD` in `util/metautils` vs `MD` in `metadata`), the conflict is ambiguous. The intent appears to be the same (key deletion), but the implementation differs across packages. Without additional context to reconcile the types or key processing methods, the conflict remains unresolved.

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```go
//
// It works analogously to http.Header.Del, deleting all values if they exist.
//
// The function is binary-key safe.

<<<<<<< HEAD:util/metautils/nicemd.go
func (m NiceMD) Del(key string) NiceMD {
	k := strings.ToLower(key)
=======
func (m MD) Del(key string) MD {
	k, _ := encodeKeyValue(key, "")

	delete(m, k)
	return m
}

// Set sets the given value in a metadata.
```
