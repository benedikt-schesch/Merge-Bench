I'll analyze the merge conflict and provide the resolved code snippet while preserving the surrounding context exactly as given.

```go
// This function is a helper function for queryParams, that keeps track of cyclical message references
//  through the use of
//      touched map[string]bool
// If a cycle is discovered, an error is returned, as cyclical data structures aren't allowed
//  in query parameters.
<<<<<<< HEAD:protoc-gen-swagger/genswagger/template.go
func nestedQueryParams(message *descriptor.Message, field *descriptor.Field, prefix string, reg *descriptor.Registry, pathParams []descriptor.Parameter, body *descriptor.Body, touchedIn map[string]bool) (params []swaggerParameterObject, err error) {

func nestedQueryParams(message *descriptor.Message, field *descriptor.Field, prefix string, reg *descriptor.Registry, pathParams []descriptor.Parameter, body *descriptor.Body, touchedIn map[string]bool) (params []openapiParameterObject, err error) {
>>>>>>> 0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6:protoc-gen-openapiv2/internal/genopenapi/template.go
	// make sure the parameter is not already listed as a path parameter
	for _, pathParam := range pathParams {
		if pathParam.Target == field {
			return nil, nil
		}

```

**Reasoning for keeping the conflict:**
1. The conflict involves different return types (`swaggerParameterObject` vs `openapiParameterObject`) which appear to be significant type changes
2. The conflicting versions come from different file paths, suggesting possible refactoring or package reorganization
3. The function name and purpose remain consistent, but the type system change indicates semantic differences
4. Without broader context about the project's direction (Swagger vs OpenAPI), it's ambiguous which type should be preferred
5. The file path differences suggest these might be parallel implementations rather than a true merge conflict

Since the intent is ambiguous and we can't determine which version should take precedence while maintaining semantic correctness, I've preserved the conflict markers as instructed.
