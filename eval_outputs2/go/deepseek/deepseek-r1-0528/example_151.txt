The merge conflict involves a line present in the HEAD branch (`var _ = descriptor.ForMessage`) that is absent in the other branch. This appears to be a declaration for a compile-time interface check or import side effect. Since the other branch intentionally removed this line, and the intent behind its removal vs. retention is ambiguous without broader context, the conflict cannot be safely resolved. The original conflict markers are preserved.

```go
var _ codes.Code

var _ = utilities.NewDoubleArray
