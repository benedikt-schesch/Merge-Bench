Package validator

`validator` is a generic request contents validator server-side middleware for gRPC.

# Request Validator Middleware

Validating input is important, and hard. It also causes a lot of boilerplate code. This middleware
checks for the existence of a `Validate` method on each of the messages of a gRPC request. This
includes the single request of the `Unary` calls, as well as each message of the inbound Stream calls.
