Based on the semantic analysis of the merge conflict, here's the resolved version. The conflict involved two different timestamps for the same asset file. Since both branches modify the same field (`modTime`) and there's no functional difference between the two timestamps for the application's operation, I've selected the more recent timestamp from the merging branch as it likely represents a later update. The whitespace difference was also harmonized to the cleaner single-space version.

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreEiffelstudioBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/EiffelStudio", size: 35, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreElisp = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\x52\x56\x70\xce\xcf\x2d\xc8\xcc\x49\x4d\xe1\xd2\xd2\x4b\xcd\x49\xe6\xe2\x52\x56\x08\x48\x4c\xce\x4e\x4c\xcf\xcc\x4b\xe7\xd2\x4b\x4e\x2c\xce\xe6\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x9c\x93\x49\x5c\x24\x00\x00\x00")
