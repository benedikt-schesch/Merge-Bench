I'll resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intent behind both changes. The conflict is in the import statements, which show two different sets of dependencies:

1. **HEAD branch**: Uses v1 of grpc-gateway and older protobuf descriptors
2. **Other branch**: Updates to v2 of grpc-gateway and new protobuf descriptors

The key semantic changes are:
- Migration from `github.com/golang/protobuf` to `google.golang.org/protobuf`
- Update to v2 paths for grpc-gateway modules
- Additional import for pluginpb functionality

Here's the resolved version maintaining proper dependencies:

```go

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"

	"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/internal/casing"
	"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/internal/httprule"
	"google.golang.org/protobuf/types/descriptorpb"
	"google.golang.org/protobuf/types/pluginpb"
)

// IsWellKnownType returns true if the provided fully qualified type name is considered 'well-known'.
func IsWellKnownType(typeName string) bool {
	_, ok := wellKnownTypeConv[typeName]
```

Resolution rationale:
1. Kept the v2 imports since they're the updated version
2. Maintained the new protobuf descriptor packages
3. Preserved all required functionality (casing, httprule, descriptors)
4. Removed the old descriptor package as it's superseded by descriptorpb
5. Added pluginpb for completeness as it's needed in the new version

The function logic remains unchanged since it doesn't directly use these imports.
