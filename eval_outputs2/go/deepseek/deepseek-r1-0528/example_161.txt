Here's the resolved code snippet with the conflict resolved based on semantic intent. Both changes are preserved since they serve different purposes:

1. The function signature from the other branch is kept as it adds new parameters (`reqTimeTest` and `resTimeTest`)
2. The version initialization from HEAD is preserved as it's needed for functionality
3. The common body code remains unchanged

```go
		return factory.connections[connectionID]
	}
	return tracker
}

func capture(db platform.TestCaseDB, req *http.Request, resp *http.Response, logger *zap.Logger, ctx context.Context, reqTimeTest time.Time, resTimeTest time.Time) {
	V1Beta1 := models.GetVersion()
	reqBody, err := io.ReadAll(req.Body)
	if err != nil {
		logger.Error("failed to read the http request body", zap.Error(err))
		return
	}

```
