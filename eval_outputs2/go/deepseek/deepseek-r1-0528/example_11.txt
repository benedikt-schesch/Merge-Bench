Based on the context, the conflict involves the `Version` constant declaration. Both branches are defining the same constant but with different values. Considering semantic intent:

1. The HEAD branch (`3.0.0-dev`) appears to be preparing for a major new version
2. The other branch (`2.15.2`) represents a stable release version

Since merging would create an ambiguous version identity, and without knowing release strategy context, this conflict requires manual resolution. The original conflicted snippet is preserved:

```go

	"golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix"
)

// Version # of resty
<<<<<<< HEAD
const Version = "3.0.0-dev"
=======
const Version = "2.15.2"
>>>>>>> 231ca0ec16a5cfc867e23737e1dbef274e6973fe

// New method creates a new Resty client.
func New() *Client {
	return NewWithTransportSettings(nil)
}

```
