Based on the provided context, the conflict arises because both branches modify the same field (`onEvict`) but with incompatible type declarations. The HEAD branch uses a custom type `onEvictFunc`, while the other branch uses an inline function signature. Since I can't verify the existence/compatibility of `onEvictFunc` and the surrounding context doesn't resolve this ambiguity, I'm returning the unresolved conflict:

```go
	// keys are read.
	getBuf *ringBuffer
	// setBuf is a buffer allowing us to batch/drop Sets during times of high
	// contention.
	setBuf chan *item
<<<<<<< HEAD
	// onEvict is called for item evictions
	onEvict onEvictFunc
=======
	// onEvict is called for item evictions.
	onEvict func(uint64, uint64, interface{}, int64)
>>>>>>> 29b4dd7a077785696ba5422081b3c301d4c1e5f1
	// KeyToHash function is used to customize the key hashing algorithm.
	// Each key will be hashed using the provided function. If keyToHash value
	// is not set, the default keyToHash function is used.
	keyToHash func(interface{}) (uint64, uint64)
	// stop is used to stop the processItems goroutine.
```

Reason for not resolving:
1. The types (`onEvictFunc` vs inline signature) are syntactically incompatible
2. No surrounding context confirms if `onEvictFunc` is defined elsewhere
3. The comment differences (period vs no period) are trivial compared to the type conflict
4. Semantic intent is ambiguous without knowing which type declaration matches the codebase's architecture

A human should resolve this by:
1. Checking if `onEvictFunc` type exists in the codebase
2. Determining which declaration matches other callback patterns (like `keyToHash`)
3. Choosing either the type abstraction (HEAD) or inline signature (other branch) consistently
