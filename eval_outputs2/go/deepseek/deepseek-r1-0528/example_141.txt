Based on the semantic intent and the evolution from Swagger to OpenAPI, I'll resolve the conflict by selecting the OpenAPI version since it represents an updated naming convention while maintaining identical functionality. The resolved snippet preserves all context and spacing:

```go
		}
	}
	return ""
}

// messageToQueryParameters converts a message to a list of OpenAPI query parameters.
func messageToQueryParameters(message *descriptor.Message, reg *descriptor.Registry, pathParams []descriptor.Parameter, body *descriptor.Body) (params []openapiParameterObject, err error) {
	for _, field := range message.Fields {
		p, err := queryParams(message, field, "", reg, pathParams, body)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}

```

Key resolution points:
1. Comment updated to "OpenAPI" terminology (modern standard)
2. Return type changed to `openapiParameterObject` (consistent naming)
3. Function signature remains functionally identical
4. All context and spacing preserved exactly as in original
5. Body remains unchanged since both versions were identical

The resolution reflects the project's evolution from Swagger to OpenAPI naming conventions while maintaining identical implementation semantics.
