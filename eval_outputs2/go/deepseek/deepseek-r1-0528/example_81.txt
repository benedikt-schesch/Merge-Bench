I've analyzed the semantic merge conflict in the import statements. The conflict arises from both branches updating different parts of the gRPC middleware imports, likely due to a version migration (v1 to v2). 

The resolution maintains the updated v2 packages from the right side while preserving the testing packages from the left side. Here's the resolved version:

```go

import (
	"context"
	"testing"

	"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/interceptors/recovery"
	grpc_testing "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/testing"
	pb_testproto "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/testing/testproto"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"
	"google.golang.org/grpc"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
```

Key changes made:
1. Kept the v2 recovery import from right side (`interceptors/recovery`)
2. Preserved the testing packages (`grpc_testing`, `pb_testproto`) from left side
3. Maintained all common imports unchanged
4. Removed the obsolete v1 recovery import since it's superseded by v2
5. Kept consistent aliasing for testing packages

This resolution:
- Maintains compatibility with v2 middleware
- Preserves test functionality
- Avoids duplicate imports
- Keeps proper package aliases required by test code
