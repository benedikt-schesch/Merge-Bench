```go
var _ codes.Code
var _ io.Reader
var _ status.Status
var _ = runtime.String
var _ = utilities.NewDoubleArray
<<<<<<< HEAD
var _ = descriptor.ForMessage

var _ = metadata.Join

var (
	filter_Greeter_SayHello_0 = &utilities.DoubleArray{Encoding: map[string]int{"name": 0}, Base: []int{1, 1, 0}, Check: []int{0, 1, 2}}
)

```

The conflict remains unresolved because the intent is ambiguous. The HEAD branch adds a reference to `descriptor.ForMessage` while the other branch removes it. Without additional context about:
1. Whether this reference is required for functionality in HEAD
2. Why it was removed in the other branch (e.g., refactoring, dependency change)
3. Import statements that might clarify package relationships

I cannot safely determine which change should take precedence. Both versions are semantically valid but serve different purposes. The conflict markers are preserved as instructed.
