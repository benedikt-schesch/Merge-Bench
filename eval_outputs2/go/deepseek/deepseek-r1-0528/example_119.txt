Based on the provided code snippet and conflict, I'll resolve this by preserving the error check while maintaining the logical flow. The conflict is about whitespace formatting around an error check after an assignment.

Here's the resolved version:

```go
	if !ok {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "missing parameter %s", "int32Val")
	}

	protoReq.Int32Val, err = runtime.Int32Value(val)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "type mismatch, parameter: %s, error: %v", "int32Val", err)
	}

	if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Both branches agree on the core functionality: assigning `protoReq.Int32Val` and immediately checking for errors
2. The only conflict is whitespace - HEAD has an extra blank line while the other branch doesn't
3. Removing the blank line maintains standard Go idiom where error checks immediately follow the operation that might produce them
4. This preserves the semantic intent of both branches while eliminating unnecessary whitespace
5. The error message and handling logic remain unchanged

The resolution maintains the critical error handling flow while using the more compact formatting that's conventional in Go for immediate error checks after assignments.
