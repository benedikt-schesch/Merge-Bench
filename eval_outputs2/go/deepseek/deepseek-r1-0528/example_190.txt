package download

import (
	"bytes"
	"io"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
	"reflect"
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
- Both sides are adding imports to the same block
- The `bytes` import from the incoming branch (`c7927ab...`) is new functionality
- The other imports (`io`, `ioutil`, etc.) exist in both branches
- Adding `bytes` at the top preserves the original order from the incoming branch while maintaining all existing imports
- No ambiguity exists since the changes are additive and non-conflicting
- Spacing and formatting are preserved exactly as in the surrounding context
