The merge conflict involves two different timestamps for the `modTime` field in the `bindataFileInfo` struct initialization. Both branches also have a minor whitespace difference in the `asset` initialization (`info:  info` vs `info: info`). 

Since the timestamps represent different points in time (1444419364 = 2015-10-09, 1467390283 = 2016-07-01) and there's no semantic context to determine which timestamp is correct, this conflict cannot be automatically resolved. The timestamps likely represent different build/generation times, and choosing one would require domain knowledge about which version of the file is correct.

The conflict is preserved as shown below:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreVvvvBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/VVVV", size: 57, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info:  info}
