Based on analyzing the merge conflict, both branches are trying to achieve the same semantic goal of creating a file asset with metadata. The only differences are:

1. The `modTime` timestamp value
2. A minor whitespace difference in the asset struct initialization

Since the timestamp likely represents when the file was last modified in each branch, and we have no context to determine which timestamp is more appropriate, this conflict requires manual resolution. The whitespace difference is trivial but should be handled consistently.

Here is the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignorePerlBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Perl", size: 191, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info:  info}
=======
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Perl", size: 191, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
>>>>>>> 73fedc727538381d4e1048ee03be6b45e977a076
	return a, nil
}
