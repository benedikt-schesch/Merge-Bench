I'll resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intent of both changes. The conflict is in the `runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext` call where one branch adds a method path parameter.

Here's the resolved version preserving all context:

```go
		ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(req.Context())
		defer cancel()
		var stream runtime.ServerTransportStream
		ctx = grpc.NewContextWithServerTransportStream(ctx, &stream)
		inboundMarshaler, outboundMarshaler := runtime.MarshalerForRequest(mux, req)
		rctx, err := runtime.AnnotateIncomingContext(ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello")
		if err != nil {
			runtime.HTTPError(ctx, mux, outboundMarshaler, w, req, err)
			return
		}
		resp, md, err := local_request_Greeter_SayHello_4(rctx, inboundMarshaler, server, req, pathParams)
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. The method path `/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.helloworld.Greeter/SayHello` provides explicit gRPC routing information
2. This matches standard gRPC gateway patterns where method paths are required for proper routing
3. The additional parameter doesn't conflict with existing functionality
4. Preserves error handling and subsequent logic unchanged
5. Both versions are semantically similar, but the 4-argument version is more complete

The conflict is resolved by keeping the method path parameter since it provides necessary routing context without breaking existing functionality.
