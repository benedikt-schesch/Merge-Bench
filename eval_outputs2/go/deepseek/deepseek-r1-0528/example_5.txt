func (ev *EventMouse) When() time.Time {
	return ev.t

```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
The conflict centers around the presence of an `esc string` field in the struct. Since:
1. The method `When()` doesn't reference this field
2. There's no additional context about its purpose or usage
3. The two branches fundamentally disagree on the struct's composition

This conflict requires human judgment to resolve. The `esc` field might represent:
- A necessary feature addition in HEAD
- An obsolete field removed in the other branch
- A conflicting semantic change

Without seeing how `esc` is used elsewhere in the codebase, I cannot safely resolve this conflict. The snippet is preserved with conflict markers for developer intervention.
