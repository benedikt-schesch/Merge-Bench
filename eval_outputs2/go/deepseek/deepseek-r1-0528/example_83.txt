The conflict involves defining a type alias for gRPC metadata. Both sides aim to create a convenience wrapper, but they differ in naming and package references. The HEAD branch uses `NiceMD` with `metadata.MD`, while the other branch uses `MD` with `grpcMetadata.MD`. The surrounding context shows the imported package is explicitly aliased as `grpcMetadata`, and the subsequent function comment references `grpcMetadata.MD` and `MD`.

Here's the resolved snippet preserving context and spacing:

```go
	"strings"

	grpcMetadata "google.golang.org/grpc/metadata"
)

// MD is a convenience wrapper defining extra functions on the metadata.
type MD grpcMetadata.MD

// ExtractIncoming extracts an inbound metadata from the server-side context.
//
// This function always returns a MD wrapper of the grpcMetadata.MD, in case the context doesn't have metadata it returns
// a new empty MD.
```

Key resolution points:
1. Used `MD` for type name (matches the function comment's "MD wrapper")
2. Used `grpcMetadata.MD` to match the actual imported package alias
3. Kept identical comment structure from both branches
4. Preserved all surrounding context and spacing exactly as provided

The resolution maintains consistency with existing package aliases and documentation references while providing a concise type name.
