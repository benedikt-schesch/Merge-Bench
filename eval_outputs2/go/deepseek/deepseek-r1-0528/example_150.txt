I've analyzed the merge conflict regarding the `output` type in the test struct. Based on semantic understanding:

1. Both branches are trying to define a test case for duration conversion
2. The conflict is about which duration type to use:
   - HEAD uses `*duration.Duration`
   - Other branch uses `*durationpb.Duration`
3. Without seeing the full context of imports and implementation, it's ambiguous which type is correct
4. Both types could be valid depending on package structure and implementation details

Since the intent is ambiguous, I'm returning the unresolved conflict as requested:

```go

func TestConvertDuration(t *testing.T) {
	specs := []struct {
		name    string
		input   string
<<<<<<< HEAD
		output  *duration.Duration
=======
		output  *durationpb.Duration
>>>>>>> 0e11f6f8faadec71484fea2af292dcb6c56230d6
		wanterr bool
	}{
		{
			name:  "a valid duration",
			input: `"123.456s"`,
```
