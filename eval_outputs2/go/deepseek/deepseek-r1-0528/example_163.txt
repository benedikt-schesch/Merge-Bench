Based on analyzing the semantic intent of both branches, I've resolved the conflict by combining both sets of fields since they serve distinct purposes and appear complementary:

```go
			mock.Spec = models.MockSpec{
				Metadata: PostSpec.Metadata,
				// OutputBinary: genericSpec.Objects,
				PostgresRequests:  PostSpec.PostgresRequests,
				PostgresResponses: PostSpec.PostgresResponses,
				ReqTimestampMock:  PostSpec.ReqTimestampMock,
				ResTimestampMock:  PostSpec.ResTimestampMock,
			}
		case models.SQL:
			mysqlSpec := spec.MySQLSpec{}
			err := m.Spec.Decode(&mysqlSpec)
			if err != nil {
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. The HEAD version provides core PostgreSQL request/response handling
2. The merging branch adds timestamp tracking fields
3. Both sets of fields appear semantically compatible:
   - `PostgresRequests/Responses` handle data content
   - `ReqTimestampMock/ResTimestampMock` handle timing metadata
4. No field name conflicts exist
5. The comment remains preserved as originally positioned

The resolved version maintains all functionality from both branches while preserving the original structure and spacing of the context.
