```go
	newtios.Lflag &^= syscall.ECHO | syscall.ECHONL | syscall.ICANON |
		syscall.ISIG | syscall.IEXTEN
	newtios.Cflag &^= syscall.CSIZE | syscall.PARENB
	newtios.Cflag |= syscall.CS8

	// We wake up only when at least 1 byte has arrived
	newtios.Cc[syscall.VMIN] = 1
	newtios.Cc[syscall.VTIME] = 0

	tios = uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&newtios))

	ioc = uintptr(syscall.TIOCSETA)
	if _, _, e1 := syscall.Syscall6(syscall.SYS_IOCTL, fd, ioc, tios, 0, 0, 0); e1 != 0 {
		e = e1
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
The conflict centers around VMIN/VTIME terminal settings. The HEAD version explicitly sets these to enable blocking reads until at least 1 byte arrives (`VMIN=1, VTIME=0`). The other branch removes these settings. 

Since:
1. The comment clarifies the intentional blocking behavior
2. These settings are critical for proper terminal I/O in raw mode
3. Removing them would change fundamental semantics
4. The other branch provides no alternative implementation

We retain the HEAD version to preserve the documented blocking behavior. The settings are necessary for correct terminal operation as ICANON was disabled earlier.
