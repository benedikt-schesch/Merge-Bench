The conflict arises from differing approaches to validation within the gRPC interceptor. The HEAD version uses a simple `validate(req)` call, while the other branch introduces enhanced validation with context, fail-fast behavior, and error callbacks. Since the other branch's version provides more control through evaluated options and aligns with the comment about fallback behavior, it's the more complete solution. 

Here's the resolved code:

```go
// Note that generated codes prior to protoc-gen-validate v0.6.0 do not provide an all-validation
// interface. In this case the interceptor fallbacks to legacy validation and `all` is ignored.
func UnaryServerInterceptor(opts ...Option) grpc.UnaryServerInterceptor {
	o := evaluateOpts(opts)
	return func(ctx context.Context, req interface{}, info *grpc.UnaryServerInfo, handler grpc.UnaryHandler) (interface{}, error) {
		if err := validate(ctx, req, o.shouldFailFast, o.onValidationErrCallback); err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		return handler(ctx, req)
	}
}
```

Key resolution points:
1. Maintains the options evaluation (`o := evaluateOpts(opts)`)
2. Uses the enhanced validation call from the other branch that includes:
   - Context (`ctx`)
   - Fail-fast flag (`o.shouldFailFast`)
   - Error callback (`o.onValidationErrCallback`)
3. Preserves all surrounding context and spacing
4. The chosen version provides more control over validation behavior while maintaining the fallback mechanism mentioned in the comment

This resolution keeps the option handling consistent and provides richer validation capabilities while maintaining the intended legacy fallback behavior.
