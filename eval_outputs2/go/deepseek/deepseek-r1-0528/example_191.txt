Here's the resolved snippet with the conflict merged based on semantic intent:

```go
	PodIP string `json:"podIP,omitempty"`

	// Daemoned tracks whether or not this node was daemoned and need to be terminated
	Daemoned *bool `json:"daemoned,omitempty"`

	// RetryStrategy contains retry information about the node and controls how to retry it
	RetryStrategy *RetryStrategy `json:"retryStrategy,omitempty"`

	// Outputs captures output parameter values and artifact locations
	Outputs *Outputs `json:"outputs,omitempty"`

```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Both branches agree this field is about retry behavior
2. The "contains retry information" part (from right side) describes what the field holds
3. The "controls how to retry" part (from left side) describes its purpose
4. Changed "step" to "node" for consistency with surrounding context ("node" appears in both Daemoned comment and right side)
5. The merged comment preserves both informational and functional aspects while maintaining contextual consistency

The solution maintains all surrounding context exactly as provided while resolving the semantic intent of both branches.
