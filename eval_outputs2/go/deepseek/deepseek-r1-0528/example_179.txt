I'll resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intent of both changes. The HEAD branch focuses solely on writing the request buffer, while the other branch adds timing logging and a comment about the write operation. These changes are compatible as they serve different purposes.

Here's the resolved code:

```go
		mongoRequests = append(mongoRequests, models.MongoRequest{
			Header:    &requestHeader,
			Message:   mongoRequest,
			ReadDelay: int64(readRequestDelay),
		})
		logStr += fmt.Sprintf("after reading request from client: %v\n", time.Since(started))
		// write the request message to the mongo server
		_, err = destConn.Write(requestBuffer)
		if err != nil {
			logger.Error("failed to write the request buffer to mongo server", zap.Error(err), zap.String("mongo server address", destConn.RemoteAddr().String()))
			return
		}
```

Resolution reasoning:
1. Preserved the logging from the other branch (`logStr += ...`) as it provides valuable timing diagnostics
2. Kept the explanatory comment about writing to MongoDB
3. Maintained the core write operation from both branches
4. Verified the changes are semantically compatible - logging doesn't affect the write operation
5. Preserved all spacing and context exactly as provided

The solution combines both branches' intents:
- Keeps performance logging (other branch)
- Maintains core functionality of writing to connection (both branches)
- Adds documentation via comment (other branch)
