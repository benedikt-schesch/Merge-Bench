```go
				readResponseDelay := time.Since(started)

				// write the reply to mongo client
				_, err = clientConn.Write(responseBuffer)
				if err != nil {
					// fmt.Println(logStr)
					logger.Error("failed to write the reply message to mongo client", zap.Error(err), zap.Any("client conn id", clientConnId), zap.Any("dest conn id", destConnId))
					return
				}
				logger.Debug(fmt.Sprintf("the response in the mongo parser after passing to client: %v", len(responseBuffer)))

				// logStr += fmt.Sprintln("after writting response to the client: ", time.Since(started), "current time is: ", time.Now())
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
1. Preserved the commented `fmt.Println` from HEAD since it doesn't affect runtime behavior
2. Kept the enhanced logging from the incoming branch (`zap.Any` fields) as it adds valuable debugging context
3. Both changes are complementary - the comment documents historical debugging while the extra fields improve operational logging
4. The return behavior remains unchanged from both branches

The merge combines both intentions:  
- Maintains the HEAD's commented debug line (non-functional)  
- Incorporates the incoming branch's improved error logging with connection IDs  
- No ambiguity since changes affect different aspects of the logging behavior
