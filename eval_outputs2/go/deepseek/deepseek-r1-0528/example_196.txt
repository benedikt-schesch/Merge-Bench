```go

)

var (
	//go:embed pkgs op.cue ql.cue
	fs embed.FS
)

// GetPackages Get Stdlib packages
func GetPackages(tagTempl string) (map[string]string, error) {

```

Reasoning:
1. Both branches agree on embedding `pkgs` and `op.cue`
2. The right branch adds `ql.cue` which appears to be a new file that should be included
3. This is a safe additive change - including extra files won't break existing functionality
4. The merge combines both versions' file lists
5. The context before/after conflict markers remains unchanged

The resolution maintains all required files while adding the new `ql.cue` file from the right branch. The embedding directive now includes all three resources needed by the combined codebase.
