The conflict arises from a minor whitespace difference between branches. Both versions perform the same operations:
1. Assign `runtime.StringValue(val)` to `protoReq.StrVal`
2. Check for errors in the assignment
3. Handle `req.ParseForm()` in the following line

The only difference is an extra newline in HEAD after the assignment. Since this doesn't affect functionality and the error check should typically appear immediately after the assignment in Go, we'll resolve by keeping the more compact version.

Resolved code:
```go
	if !ok {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "missing parameter %s", "strVal")
	}

	protoReq.StrVal, err = runtime.StringValue(val)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, metadata, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "type mismatch, parameter: %s, error: %v", "strVal", err)
	}

	if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {
```
