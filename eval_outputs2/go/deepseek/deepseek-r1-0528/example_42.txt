The conflict remains unresolved due to ambiguity in the intent behind the timestamp differences. Key observations:

1. Both versions agree on:
   - File name: `"conf/gitignore/ForceDotCom"`
   - Size: 57 bytes
   - File mode: `os.FileMode(420)`

2. Conflict points:
   - Different timestamps (`1444419364` vs `1467390283`)
   - Formatting difference in asset initialization (`info:  info` vs `info: info`)

Without additional context about:
- Why the timestamps changed
- Which timestamp represents the correct version
- Whether the formatting difference is intentional

It's impossible to determine semantic intent. The timestamps differ by ~9 months (2015 vs 2016), suggesting fundamentally different versions of the file. The formatting difference appears trivial but could indicate style preferences. 

Resolution requires domain knowledge about:
1. Which timestamp corresponds to the actual file modification
2. Project's code style standards
3. Whether this file was intentionally modified in one branch

Since these questions can't be answered from the snippet alone, the conflict is preserved for manual resolution.
