I'll help you with the merge conflict. The conflict is about different timestamps for the `modTime` field. Since the intent is ambiguous (both branches are trying to set a valid timestamp but we don't know which one is correct), I'll return the snippet with the conflict markers intact as requested.

Here's the exact snippet preserved with the conflict:

```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreAdaBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

<<<<<<< HEAD
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Ada", size: 51, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1444419364, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info:  info}
=======
	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/Ada", size: 51, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
>>>>>>> 73fedc727538381d4e1048ee03be6b45e977a076
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreAgda = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xd2\x4b\x4c\x4f\x49\xcc\xe4\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x27\x6c\x17\xd3\x08\x00\x00\x00")


```

The conflict shows two different timestamps for the same file:
1. `1444419364` (October 9, 2015) from HEAD
2. `1467390283` (July 1, 2016) from branch `73fedc7`

Since we can't determine which timestamp is correct without more context, the conflict should be resolved manually by:
1. Checking which timestamp matches the actual file modification time
2. Verifying if either branch had intentional changes to this file
3. Consulting the commit history to understand why the timestamps differ
