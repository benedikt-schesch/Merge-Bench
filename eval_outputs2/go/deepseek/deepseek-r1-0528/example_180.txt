```go

				// write the reply to mongo client
				_, err = destConn.Write(requestBuffer1)
				if err != nil {
					// fmt.Println(logStr)
					logger.Error("failed to write the reply message to mongo client", zap.Error(err), zap.Any("client conn id", clientConnId), zap.Any("dest conn id", destConnId))
					return

				// logStr += fmt.Sprintln("after writting response to the client: ", time.Since(started), "current time is: ", time.Now())


```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
The conflict occurred between two versions of error logging. The resolution:
1. Keeps the commented `// fmt.Println(logStr)` from HEAD since it's harmless debugging code that might be useful later
2. Takes the enhanced logging from the other branch that adds connection IDs (`clientConnId`, `destConnId`) as these provide valuable context for debugging
3. Maintains both semantic improvements - preserving the commented debug line while adding the connection identifiers to the active error log

This combines both intents: keeping potential debugging aids while adding critical operational context to the active error message. The connection IDs help trace errors across distributed systems without losing the commented debug line that might be useful during development.
