Here's the resolved code snippet with the conflict fixed based on semantic intent:

```go
}

func detectors(path string) []detector.Detector {
	return []detector.Detector{
		&detector.GoDetector{Root: path},
		&detector.NodeJSDetector{Root: path},
		&detector.PHPDetector{Root: path},
		&detector.PoetryDetector{Root: path},
		&detector.PythonDetector{Root: path},
	}
}

```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. Both branches agree on the core functionality - creating a list of language detectors
2. The conflict was about adding a NodeJS detector between Go and PHP detectors
3. The NodeJS detector addition doesn't conflict with any existing detectors
4. This preserves the intended functionality from both branches:
   - Maintains the Go detector from HEAD
   - Includes the NodeJS detector from the feature branch
   - Keeps the subsequent PHP, Poetry, and Python detectors unchanged
5. The order maintains logical grouping of related technologies

The resolution adds the missing NodeJS detector while preserving all other context exactly as provided.
