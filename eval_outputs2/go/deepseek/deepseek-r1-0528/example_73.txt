```go
		want.TypeUrl = "blah.com/" + dynamicMessageName
		want.Value = b
	}

	if !proto.Equal(&got, &want) {
		t.Errorf("message contents not set correctly after unmarshaling JSON: got %v, wanted %v", &got, &want)
	}
}

const (
	dynamicMessageName = "github_com.golang.protobuf.jsonpb.dynamicMessage"

```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. Both versions achieve the same semantic intent of comparing protobuf messages and reporting an error if they differ
2. The difference is purely presentational (`&got` vs `got` in error formatting)
3. Using pointer values (`&got`, `&want`) is more consistent with:
   - The `proto.Equal` call which takes pointers
   - Common Go practice for printing structs with potentially custom `String()` methods
   - The original implementation (HEAD version)
4. There's no functional difference since `%v` will print the same value regardless of pointer indirection
5. Preserving the HEAD version maintains original author intent and file location context
