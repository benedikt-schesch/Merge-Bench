```go
	allowPatchFeature  bool
	standalone         bool
}

// New returns a new generator which generates grpc gateway files.
func New(reg *descriptor.Registry, useRequestContext bool, registerFuncSuffix, pathTypeString, modulePathString string,
	allowPatchFeature, standalone bool) gen.Generator {
	var imports []descriptor.GoPackage
	for _, pkgpath := range []string{
		"context",
		"io",
		"net/http",
```

I've resolved the merge conflict by:
1. Recognizing both branches need to initialize `allowPatchFeature` and `standalone` fields
2. Keeping the multi-line function signature from the feature branch for readability
3. Maintaining both boolean parameters needed for struct initialization
4. Preserving all surrounding context and formatting exactly as provided

The resolution maintains both functional requirements:
- HEAD's `allowPatchFeature` parameter
- Feature branch's `standalone` parameter
While keeping the code readable with the parameter split. The struct fields above confirm both parameters are required for proper initialization.
