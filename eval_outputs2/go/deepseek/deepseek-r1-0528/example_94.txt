Based on the semantic analysis of both changes:

1. The HEAD change uses the older v1 grpc-gateway imports with golang/protobuf
2. The branch change upgrades to grpc-gateway/v2 with the new google.golang.org/protobuf
3. The branch change is likely part of a migration to v2
4. Both changes are mutually exclusive due to version upgrade
5. The internal package from HEAD isn't present in the branch change

Here's the resolved version preserving the branch's upgrade to v2:

```go
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
	"net/http/httptest"
	"testing"

	"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime"
	pb "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime/internal/examplepb"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/status"
	"google.golang.org/protobuf/proto"
)
```

Key resolution points:
- Used branch's v2 imports for grpc-gateway
- Removed HEAD's internal package as it's not needed in v2
- Kept the new protobuf package (google.golang.org/protobuf)
- Preserved all spacing and context lines
- Maintained closing parenthesis exactly as in original
