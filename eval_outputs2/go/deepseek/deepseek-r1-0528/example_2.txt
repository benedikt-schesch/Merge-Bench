```go
	TLSSkipVerify bool
	Data          string
	Quiet         bool
	Colors        bool
	Wordlist      string
	OutputFile    string
	OutputFormat  string
	StopOn403     bool
	Delay         optRange
	Filters       []FilterProvider
	Matchers      []FilterProvider
	Threads       int
	Context       context.Context
```

The conflict resolution preserves both sets of changes:
1. Keeps `OutputFile` and `OutputFormat` from HEAD (output configuration)
2. Keeps `StopOn403` from the other branch (request handling behavior)
3. Maintains alphabetical/grouping consistency with surrounding fields
4. Preserves all spacing and line breaks exactly as in the original context

Both changes are semantically independent and address different concerns, so they can coexist without conflicts. The order places output-related fields first since they appear earlier in the conflict structure, followed by the new boolean flag.
