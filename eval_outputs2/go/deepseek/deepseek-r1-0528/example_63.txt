The conflict involves only the deprecation comment for `UnmarshalMessageSet`. Both branches agree on deprecating the function, but differ in capitalization ("Do" vs "do"). Following Go conventions for deprecation comments where the first word is typically capitalized, I resolved the conflict by keeping the capitalized version from HEAD.

The trailing conflict markers after the function appear to be incomplete or unrelated to this specific conflict, so they remain unresolved per the requirements.

```go
>>>>>>> 84668698ea25b64748563aa20726db66a6b8d299
func MarshalMessageSet(interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
	return nil, errors.New("proto: not implemented")
}

// Deprecated: Do not use.
func UnmarshalMessageSet([]byte, interface{}) error {
	return errors.New("proto: not implemented")
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
