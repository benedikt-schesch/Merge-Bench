)
```

**Reasoning:**  
The conflict involves a single line (`var _ = descriptor.ForMessage`) present in HEAD but absent in the other branch. Since:

1. This appears to be a compile-time assertion for interface satisfaction
2. The surrounding context shows similar assertions for different types
3. There's no clear semantic overlap with other changes
4. The filter declaration below is identical in both branches

The resolution is ambiguous without deeper context about:
- Why the line was added/removed
- Whether `descriptor.ForMessage` is still needed
- Package dependencies and initialization requirements

Therefore, I'm returning the conflict unchanged for developer resolution.
