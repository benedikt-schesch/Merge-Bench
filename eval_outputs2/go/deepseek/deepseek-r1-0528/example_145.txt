Based on the semantic analysis of both changes, the conflict arises from a refactoring where types were renamed from `swagger*` to `openapi*` to better reflect OpenAPI terminology. The functionality remains identical, so we should adopt the refactored naming for consistency. Here's the resolved version:

```go
				}
				if !reg.GetDisableDefaultErrors() {
					errDef, hasErrDef := fullyQualifiedNameToOpenAPIName(".google.rpc.Status", reg)
					if hasErrDef {
						// https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.0/versions/2.0.md#responses-object
						operationObject.Responses["default"] = openapiResponseObject{
							Description: "An unexpected error response.",
							Schema: openapiSchemaObject{
								schemaCore: schemaCore{
									Ref: fmt.Sprintf("#/definitions/%s", errDef),
								},
							},
						}

```

Key resolution points:
1. Both versions implement identical functionality for error response handling
2. The refactored naming (`openapiResponseObject`, `openapiSchemaObject`) better aligns with OpenAPI standards
3. The schema structure and reference logic remains unchanged
4. The comment about OpenAPI specification remains relevant and unchanged

The resolution maintains the intended behavior while adopting the improved naming convention from the incoming branch.
