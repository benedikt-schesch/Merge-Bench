Reasoning:
1. The type alias `type Empty = emptypb.Empty` from HEAD provides essential functionality for users
2. The version assertion from the other branch (`const _ = proto.ProtoPackageIsVersion3`) is critical for protobuf compatibility
3. Both declarations serve distinct purposes and can coexist without conflicts
4. The type alias comes first as it logically continues the "Symbols defined..." comment
5. The version assertion is preserved before the file descriptor declarations where it typically appears in protobuf-generated code
6. No ambiguity exists since both changes are semantically compatible and address different concerns
