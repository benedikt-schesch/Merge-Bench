```go
	bytes, err := confGitignoreSeamgenBytes()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	info := bindataFileInfo{name: "conf/gitignore/SeamGen", size: 961, mode: os.FileMode(420), modTime: time.Unix(1467390283, 0)}
	a := &asset{bytes: bytes, info: info}
	return a, nil
}

var _confGitignoreSketchup = []byte("\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x09\x6e\x88\x00\xff\xd2\xd2\x2b\xce\x4e\xe2\x02\x04\x00\x00\xff\xff\x1e\xdd\x12\xe3\x06\x00\x00\x00")
```

Reasoning:
1. Both versions are setting the same metadata fields for the asset
2. The timestamp difference (1444419364 vs 1467390283) likely represents when the file was last updated in each branch
3. The more recent timestamp (1467390283) is preferred as it represents newer metadata
4. The spacing in the asset initialization (`info: info` vs `info:  info`) is normalized to the cleaner single-space version
5. The file content (`bytes`) remains unchanged as it's identical in both branches

The resolution preserves the semantic intent of both branches while selecting the most up-to-date metadata representation.
