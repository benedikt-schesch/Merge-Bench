I've analyzed the merge conflict. Both branches are adding different imports, but they serve distinct purposes. The HEAD branch imports `proto2_proto` as `pb2` which is used in the test function, while the other branch imports `test_proto` as `pb`. Since both imports are needed for different protocol buffer definitions, I've included both.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```go
	"strings"
	"sync"
	"testing"

	"github.com/golang/protobuf/proto"
	pb2 "github.com/golang/protobuf/internal/testprotos/proto2_proto"
	pb "github.com/golang/protobuf/proto/test_proto"
)

func TestGetExtensionsWithMissingExtensions(t *testing.T) {
	msg := &pb2.MyMessage{}
	ext1 := &pb2.Ext{}
```
