Based on the provided code snippet and surrounding context, I've analyzed the semantic intent of both sides of the merge conflict. Here's the resolved version:

```go
var _ codes.Code
var _ io.Reader
var _ status.Status
var _ = runtime.String
var _ = utilities.NewDoubleArray
var _ = metadata.Join

func request_ResponseBodyService_GetResponseBody_0(ctx context.Context, marshaler runtime.Marshaler, client ResponseBodyServiceClient, req *http.Request, pathParams map[string]string) (proto.Message, runtime.ServerMetadata, error) {
	var protoReq ResponseBodyIn
	var metadata runtime.ServerMetadata
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. The line `var _ = descriptor.ForMessage` appears to be an unused import validation
2. The other branch explicitly removed this line, indicating it's likely unnecessary
3. The surrounding code doesn't show any usage of `descriptor` functionality
4. All other imports and declarations remain unchanged as they're clearly in use
5. Removing this line maintains consistency with Go's best practices (avoiding unused imports)

The resolved version maintains the semantic integrity of both branches by removing an apparently unused declaration while preserving all functional context.
