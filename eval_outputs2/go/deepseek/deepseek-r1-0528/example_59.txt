The conflict arises from both branches adding environment variables but with different intents. The HEAD branch adds a cross-compile path if present, while the other branch enforces Go module off mode. Since these are independent concerns, both changes should be preserved. The resolution maintains the cross-compile path logic followed by the module setting.

```go
	for _, arch := range androidArchs {
		env := androidEnv[arch]
		// Add the generated packages to GOPATH for reverse bindings.
		gopath := fmt.Sprintf("GOPATH=%s%c%s", tmpdir, filepath.ListSeparator, goEnv("GOPATH"))
		env = append(env, gopath)
		if cenv[arch] != "" {
			env = append(env, cenv[arch]) // Add the Cross Compile PATH Env
		}
		// gomobile-bind does not support modules yet.
		env = append(env, "GO111MODULE=off")
		toolchain := ndk.Toolchain(arch)

		err := goBuildAt(
			filepath.Join(tmpdir, "src"),
			"./gobind",
