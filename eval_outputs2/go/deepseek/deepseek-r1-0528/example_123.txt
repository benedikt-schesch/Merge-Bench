Based on the semantic analysis, the conflict arises from different parameters being passed to `runtime.AnnotateContext`. The newer version (from branch `0e11f6f8`) provides a full method path which is required for proper context annotation in gRPC Gateway handlers. The older version (HEAD) omits this critical parameter. 

The resolution adopts the 4-argument version since:
1. The full method path (`/grpc.gateway.../CreateBook`) is necessary for gRPC Gateway's operation
2. It matches the pattern used in other generated handlers
3. The parameter is required in newer versions of gRPC Gateway

Here's the resolved snippet:

```go

	mux.Handle("POST", pattern_ABitOfEverythingService_CreateBook_0, func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, pathParams map[string]string) {
		ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(req.Context())
		defer cancel()
		inboundMarshaler, outboundMarshaler := runtime.MarshalerForRequest(mux, req)
		rctx, err := runtime.AnnotateContext(ctx, mux, req, "/grpc.gateway.examples.internal.proto.examplepb.ABitOfEverythingService/CreateBook")
		if err != nil {
			runtime.HTTPError(ctx, mux, outboundMarshaler, w, req, err)
			return
		}
		resp, md, err := request_ABitOfEverythingService_CreateBook_0(rctx, inboundMarshaler, client, req, pathParams)
```

Key changes:
- Replaced the 3-argument call with the 4-argument version
- Preserved all surrounding context exactly
- Maintained consistent spacing and variable names
- Removed merge conflict markers while keeping semantic intent

Note: The variable `outboundMarshaler` is correctly spelled in the assignment but appears as `outboundMarshaler` in the error call - this appears to be an unrelated typo in the original code that should be fixed separately.
