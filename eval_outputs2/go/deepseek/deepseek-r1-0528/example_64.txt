The conflict in the comment for `MarshalMessageSetJSON` was resolved by choosing the HEAD version (`// Deprecated: Do not use.`) as it follows Go's convention of capitalizing the first word in deprecation messages. The trailing conflict markers were preserved as they appear to be part of an incomplete conflict block that couldn't be resolved with the given context.

```go
>>>>>>> 84668698ea25b64748563aa20726db66a6b8d299
func UnmarshalMessageSet([]byte, interface{}) error {
    return errors.New("proto: not implemented")
}

// Deprecated: Do not use.
func MarshalMessageSetJSON(interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
    return nil, errors.New("proto: not implemented")
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
