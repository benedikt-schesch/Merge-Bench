I'll resolve this merge conflict by selecting the multi-line import syntax from the branch version since it's functionally equivalent to the HEAD version but follows standard Go formatting conventions for imports. Here's the resolved code:

```go
package mongoparser

import (
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/x/bsonx/bsoncore"
)

type Command string

const (
	Unknown           Command = "unknown"
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. Both versions import the exact same package (`bsoncore`)
2. The multi-line import syntax is preferred in Go when:
   - There are multiple imports (though here it's single, but consistent style matters)
   - It allows for cleaner future expansion if more imports are added
   - It matches common Go formatting conventions
3. No functional difference exists between the two versions
4. The branch version's formatting is more maintainable long-term

The conflict was purely stylistic with identical semantics, so I chose the more conventional formatting while preserving all surrounding context exactly as provided.
