Based on the provided context, I'll return the code snippet exactly as given with the merge conflict intact. The conflict occurs in the middle of a function call's arguments, and without additional context about the function signature or the purpose of these arguments, I can't determine the correct resolution.

Here's the exact snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```rust
      None,
      export,
      bundle_variable,
      module_analyzer_manager,
      polyfill,
<<<<<<< HEAD
      is_already_polyfilled,
      options,
=======
      &mut is_patch_esm_flag,
>>>>>>> 24a95b48172836d31c55697037d5dada7d9c1ef7
    )?);
  }

  let ordered_external_export = bundle_reference
    .external_export_map
```

Reasons for keeping the conflict:
1. The conflict shows two different sets of arguments being passed
2. `is_already_polyfilled`/`options` vs `&mut is_patch_esm_flag` suggest fundamentally different functionality
3. The number of arguments differs (2 vs 1)
4. Without knowing the function signature or the surrounding logic, I can't determine which combination is correct
5. The mutable borrow in one branch (`&mut`) might have ownership implications
6. The names suggest different polyfilling strategies that might be incompatible

The maintainer should resolve this by:
1. Checking the function/macro definition
2. Understanding if both features are needed
3. Determining if the arguments can coexist or are mutually exclusive
4. Testing the integrated functionality
