Here's the code snippet with the conflict preserved as requested, since the intent behind the change is ambiguous:

```rust
    exit_code: 0
    ----- stdout -----
    # This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
    #    uv pip compile --cache-dir [CACHE_DIR] --index-strategy unsafe-any-match requirements.in --no-deps
    jinja2==3.1.3
<<<<<<< HEAD
        # via -r requirements.in
=======
>>>>>>> fab8d858b636fce9e841e0228a9ebd6b3ddcbe04

    ----- stderr -----
    Resolved 1 package in [TIME]
    "###
    );

```

**Reasoning:**  
The conflict shows two different states for the test's expected output:
1. The HEAD version includes a comment (`# via -r requirements.in`) indicating dependency provenance
2. The other branch (fab8d85) omits this comment

Without additional context about:
- Whether the comment is required for test validity
- If the tool's output behavior changed between branches
- The semantic purpose of this test snapshot

It's impossible to determine which version correctly reflects the intended behavior. The comment could be either:
- Important metadata that should be preserved, or
- Superfluous information that was intentionally removed

Since the intent is ambiguous, the conflict remains unresolved as per your instructions.
