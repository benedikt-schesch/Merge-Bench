Based on the semantic analysis of both changes:

1. The HEAD version directly declares the parameter without a comment
2. The other branch adds a helpful comment explaining why `NonSend` is required
3. Both branches agree on the actual parameter type and name

The comment provides valuable context about the `NonSend` requirement, so we should preserve it while keeping the parameter declaration. The resolved version maintains the comment from the other branch while keeping the parameter declaration from both branches.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
use bevy::window::WindowId;
use bevy::winit::WinitWindows;
use winit::window::Icon;

fn set_window_icon(
    // we have to use `NonSend` here
    windows: NonSend<WinitWindows>,
) {
    let primary = windows.get_window(WindowId::primary()).unwrap();

    // here we use the `image` crate to load our icon data from a png file
```
