The conflict arises from differing lifetime parameter orders in the implementation. However, the lifetimes `'w` and `s` are interchangeable in declaration order since they're not used in the function body. The HEAD version (`'w, 's`) matches Bevy's conventional ordering for `Commands`, so it's preferred for consistency. The parameter name (`scene_handle`) is consistent in both implementations and doesn't conflict with the trait's declaration.

Resolved code:
```rust

pub trait SpawnSceneCommands {
    fn spawn_scene(&mut self, scene: Handle<Scene>);
}

impl<'w, 's> SpawnSceneCommands for Commands<'w, 's> {
    fn spawn_scene(&mut self, scene_handle: Handle<Scene>) {
        self.add(SpawnScene { scene_handle });
    }
}
