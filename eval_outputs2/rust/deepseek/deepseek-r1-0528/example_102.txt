```rust
    make_codec: MkC,
    stat_tracer: Vec<TraceFn>,
    #[cfg(feature = "multiplex")]
    multiplex: bool,
    span_provider: SP,
    shutdown_hooks: Vec<Box<dyn FnOnce() -> BoxFuture<'static, ()> + Send>>,
    _marker: PhantomData<Req>,
}

impl<S, Req>
    Server<

```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
- The `+ Send` bound added in the branch is semantically important for thread safety
- Both versions agree on the core type (`Box<dyn FnOnce() -> BoxFuture<'static, ()>`)
- The `Send` requirement ensures shutdown hooks can be safely moved between threads
- This maintains compatibility with concurrent/asynchronous execution contexts
- No ambiguity exists since the added trait bound is a safe generalization
