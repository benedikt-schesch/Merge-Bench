I've analyzed the provided code snippet with the merge conflict. The conflict arises from differing calls to `T::component_ids` - one version passes two arguments (`components, storages`) while the other passes only one (`components`). 

After examining the context:
1. Both versions initialize `component_ids` but with different parameters
2. The `initialize_bundle` function only uses `components`, not `storages`
3. The safety comment references `T::component_id` (singular) while the call is to `component_ids` (plural)
4. The surrounding code doesn't clarify which parameters are required
5. The trait implementation for `T` isn't visible in this context

Given these ambiguities and the lack of clear semantic intent from either branch, I'm returning the unresolved conflict as requested:

```rust
        components: &mut Components,
        storages: &mut Storages,
    ) -> &'a BundleInfo {
        let bundle_infos = &mut self.bundle_infos;
        let id = self.bundle_ids.entry(TypeId::of::<T>()).or_insert_with(|| {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            let component_ids = T::component_ids(components, storages);

            let component_ids = T::component_ids(components);

            let id = BundleId(bundle_infos.len());
            // SAFE: T::component_id ensures info was created
            let bundle_info = unsafe {
                initialize_bundle(std::any::type_name::<T>(), component_ids, id, components)
            };
