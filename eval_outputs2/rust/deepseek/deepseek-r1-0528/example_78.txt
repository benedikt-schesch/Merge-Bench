Based on the semantic analysis of the merge conflict, here's the resolved version preserving context and intent:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct WgpuResourceDiagnosticsPlugin;

impl Plugin for WgpuResourceDiagnosticsPlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app.add_startup_system(Self::setup_system)
            .add_system(Self::diagnostic_system);
    }
}

impl WgpuResourceDiagnosticsPlugin {
    pub const BIND_GROUPS: DiagnosticId =
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Both sides are adding identical systems (`setup_system` and `diagnostic_system`)
2. The conflict stems from Bevy API changes where `.system()` suffix became optional
3. The HEAD version uses modern Bevy syntax (0.8+), while the other branch uses legacy syntax
4. Since the context shows no other `.system()` usage, we maintain modern consistency
5. Functionality remains identical in both versions - this is purely syntactic

The resolution keeps the modern syntax while preserving the original semantic intent of both branches. The surrounding context remains unchanged with proper spacing maintained.
