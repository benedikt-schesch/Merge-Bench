I'll resolve this conflict by choosing the version with the explicit type reference (`App::add_plugins`) as it's more explicit and consistent with Rust documentation conventions. Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
    /// Adds a single plugin
    ///
    /// One of Bevy's core principles is modularity. All Bevy engine features are implemented
    /// as plugins. This includes internal features like the renderer.
    ///
    /// Bevy also provides a few sets of default plugins. See [`App::add_plugins`].
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// ```
    /// # use bevy_app::prelude::*;
    /// #
```

**Resolution reasoning:**  
Both versions aim to reference the `add_plugins` method, but use different linking styles:
1. `[`add_plugins`](Self::add_plugins)` uses relative linking
2. `[`App::add_plugins`]` uses absolute path  

I chose the absolute path version because:
- It's more explicit about the type (`App`)
- Matches common Rust documentation conventions
- Maintains clarity even if the docs are viewed outside the type context
- Both versions would resolve to the same location in this context

The functionality and intent remain identical - both correctly reference the method to add plugin collections.
