Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved due to ambiguous intent:

```rust
pub mod platform;
pub mod prelude;
pub mod settings;
pub mod system;
pub mod textinput;
<<<<<<< HEAD
pub mod window;
=======
//pub mod window;
>>>>>>> 2cc67a0957b29b57e65c0234c31703b3868e29f7

```

**Reasoning:**  
1. The conflict shows fundamentally different intents - one branch wants to include the `window` module (`pub mod window`), while the other explicitly comments it out (`//pub mod window`).  
2. Without additional context about why `window` was commented out in one branch or what functionality it provides, we can't determine which change should take precedence.  
3. This appears to be a significant architectural decision (whether to include/expose window functionality) rather than a trivial change.  
4. The conflict markers are preserved exactly as provided, maintaining original spacing and context.  

The resolution requires understanding:
- Why one branch commented out the module (deprecation? platform-specific build? temporary debugging?)
- Whether there are corresponding changes to `window` module content
- How this affects dependent code

Since we lack this information, the conflict remains unresolved.
