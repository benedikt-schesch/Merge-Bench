Based on the provided code snippet, I'll return the exact same content with the merge conflict markers preserved since the intent behind the conflicting imports is ambiguous. Here's the unchanged snippet:

```rust
use glfw::Context;
use parking_lot::Mutex;
use std::ffi::c_void;
use std::future::Future;
use std::sync::Arc;
<<<<<<< HEAD
use tokio::prelude::Future;
use tokio::runtime::TaskExecutor;
=======
>>>>>>> 2cc67a0957b29b57e65c0234c31703b3868e29f7

pub(crate) struct GlfwFlutterEngineHandler {
    pub(crate) glfw: glfw::Glfw,
    pub(crate) window: Arc<Mutex<glfw::Window>>,
    pub(crate) resource_window: Arc<Mutex<glfw::Window>>,
```

### Why I kept the conflict:
1. **Ambiguous Intent**: The HEAD branch adds Tokio-specific imports (`Future` and `TaskExecutor`) while the other branch removes them. Without seeing the struct implementation, I can't determine if these Tokio dependencies are actually used in the handler's functionality.

2. **Potential Version Conflict**: The Tokio imports appear to be from older versions (Tokio 0.2 or earlier), suggesting possible dependency version mismatches between branches.

3. **Semantic Uncertainty**: 
   - The `std::future::Future` is already imported, making the additional Tokio future import potentially redundant or conflicting
   - `TaskExecutor` might be needed for async operations, but this can't be verified without implementation context

4. **Preservation Requirement**: The instructions explicitly state to preserve conflicts when intent is unclear, and the surrounding context doesn't provide enough information to make a safe resolution.
