Based on the semantic analysis, here's the resolved version. The conflict arises from differing import styles for `bevy_ecs`, but both versions share identical core imports (`ResMut` and `FromWorld`). The other branch's version includes `IntoSystem` which is likely needed elsewhere in the file (unseen in the snippet), so we preserve that import while maintaining the surrounding context exactly:

```rust
use crate::{
    update_asset_storage_system, Asset, AssetLoader, AssetServer, AssetStage, Handle, HandleId,
    RefChange,
};
use bevy_app::{App, EventWriter, Events};
use bevy_ecs::{
    system::{IntoSystem, ResMut},
    world::FromWorld,
};
use bevy_utils::HashMap;
use crossbeam_channel::Sender;
use std::fmt::Debug;

/// Events that happen on assets of type `T`
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Preserved `IntoSystem` from the other branch since it appears intentionally added
2. Maintained multi-line import style for consistency with surrounding structured imports
3. Kept all other context identical including spacing and comments
4. All existing functionality (`ResMut`, `FromWorld`) remains available
5. No ambiguity - the added trait doesn't conflict with existing code
