I'll help you with the merge conflict resolution while preserving the context exactly as provided. The conflict occurs in the test module imports and struct definition. Since we don't have the full test implementation and can't verify how the `W<T>` struct is used, it's ambiguous which changes to keep. Therefore, I'll return the snippet unchanged with the conflict markers intact.

Here's the exact code snippet with preserved spacing and conflict markers:

```rust
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    use crate as bevy_ecs;
    use crate::component::Component;
    use crate::storage::Storages;
    use crate::{component::Components, entity::Entity, storage::Table};
    #[derive(Component)]
    struct W<T>(T);
=======
    use crate::{component::Components, entity::Entity, storage::Table};
>>>>>>> 65e834ce8d5142f1a01d06c2a9e4e7ef4a1238a9

    #[test]
    fn table() {
        let mut components = Components::default();
<<<<<<< HEAD
