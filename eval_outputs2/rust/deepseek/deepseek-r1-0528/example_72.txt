Based on the provided code snippet with a merge conflict, I've analyzed both sides of the conflict and determined that the intent is ambiguous. The key difference is whether the generic type `T` should be constrained by `Resource` or `Component`, and there's insufficient context to determine which constraint is semantically correct.

Here is the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```rust
    }

    fn default_config() {}
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
impl<'w, 's, T: Resource> SystemParamFetch<'w, 's> for ResMutState<T> {
=======
impl<'w, 's, T: Component> SystemParamFetch<'w, 's> for ResMutState<T> {
>>>>>>> 65e834ce8d5142f1a01d06c2a9e4e7ef4a1238a9
    type Item = ResMut<'w, T>;

    #[inline]
    unsafe fn get_param(
        state: &'s mut Self,
```

Reason for not resolving:
- Both `Resource` and `Component` are common traits in Rust ECS frameworks (like Bevy), but serve different purposes
- The surrounding context doesn't clarify whether `ResMutState` should work with resources or components
- Changing between these constraints could have significant downstream effects
- The commit hashes indicate these changes come from different branches with potentially conflicting intentions
- Without knowing the larger architectural context, it's unsafe to assume which constraint is correct

I recommend:
1. Consulting the authors of both branches
2. Checking trait implementations for `ResMutState`
3. Verifying usage examples in the codebase
4. Considering if both constraints could be supported through a supertrait
