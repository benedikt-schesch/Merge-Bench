Based on my semantic analysis of both changes:

1. The left side (HEAD) adds a new field (`_source`) to the `Package` variant pattern
2. The right side adds handling for a new `Extra` variant while simplifying the `Package` pattern
3. Both changes are compatible since the body only uses `package_name`
4. The intent is to handle both variants when version is None

Here's the resolved version preserving context:

```rust
                }

                Ok(Some(ResolverVersion::Available(version.clone())))
            }

            PubGrubPackage::Extra(package_name, _, None)
            | PubGrubPackage::Package(package_name, _, None, _) => {
                // Wait for the metadata to be available.
                let versions_response = self
                    .index
                    .packages
                    .wait(package_name)
```
