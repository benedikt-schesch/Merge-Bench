The merge conflict cannot be automatically resolved due to ambiguity in the intent of both branches. The pattern matching for `PubGrubPackage::Package` differs significantly between the branches:

1. **HEAD branch** expects a 4-field tuple variant:  
   `(package_name, _extra, None, _source)`
   
2. **Other branch (fab8d858)** expects a 3-field tuple variant:  
   `(package_name, None, None)`

The differences include:
- Field count mismatch (4 vs 3)
- Different ignored fields (`_extra` vs explicit `None` checks)
- Potentially different semantics for package structure

Since the enum definition isn't provided and the patterns are fundamentally incompatible, I'm preserving the conflict markers. The code snippet with unresolved conflict is:

```rust
        request_sink: &tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender<Request>,
    ) -> Result<(), ResolveError> {
        // Iterate over the potential packages, and fetch file metadata for any of them. These
        // represent our current best guesses for the versions that we _might_ select.
        for (package, range) in packages {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            let PubGrubPackage::Package(package_name, _extra, None, _source) = package else {
=======
            let PubGrubPackage::Package(package_name, None, None) = package else {
>>>>>>> fab8d858b636fce9e841e0228a9ebd6b3ddcbe04
                continue;
            };
            request_sink
                .send(Request::Prefetch(package_name.clone(), range.clone()))
                .await?;
```
