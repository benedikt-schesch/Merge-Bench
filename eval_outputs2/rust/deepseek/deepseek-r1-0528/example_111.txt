The merge conflict has been resolved by combining changes from both branches. Here's the resolution:

1. The `progress` module re-exports now include all unique items:
   - `ProgressBarIter` added from the other branch
   - Other items (`MultiProgress`, `ProgressBar`, `ProgressBarRead`, `ProgressDrawTarget`) preserved
   - `ProgressStyle` moved to a separate re-export as per the other branch

2. The rayon feature conditional export from HEAD is preserved

3. The separate `ProgressStyle` re-export from the other branch is kept

```rust
mod utils;

pub use format::{BinaryBytes, DecimalBytes, FormattedDuration, HumanBytes, HumanDuration};
pub use iter::{ProgressBarIter, ProgressIterator};
pub use progress::{
    MultiProgress, ProgressBar, ProgressBarIter, ProgressBarRead, ProgressDrawTarget,
};
pub use style::ProgressStyle;

#[cfg(feature = "with_rayon")]
pub use iter::rayon::{ParProgressBarIter, ParallelProgressIterator};

```
