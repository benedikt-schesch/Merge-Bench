I'll help resolve this merge conflict while preserving the surrounding context exactly as provided. Here's the analysis and resolution:

```rust

  for source in ordered_external_export {
    let export = &bundle_reference.external_export_map[source];

    patch_export_to_module.extend(generate_export_as_module_export(
      should_reexport_raw,
      Some(&source.to_module_id()),
      export,
      bundle_variable,
      module_analyzer_manager,
      polyfill,
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Resolution Reasoning:
1. **Semantic Analysis**: Both branches are modifying the same argument position in the function call:
   - HEAD branch adds `should_reexport_raw` flag and keeps `Some(&source)`
   - Other branch converts `source` to module ID with `to_module_id()`
   
2. **Compatibility**: These changes are not mutually exclusive - they serve different purposes:
   - `should_reexport_raw` appears to be a new configuration flag
   - `to_module_id()` is likely a refactoring of source handling
   
3. **Resolution**: Keep both changes by:
   - Preserving the new flag from HEAD (`should_reexport_raw`)
   - Using the improved source handling from the other branch (`Some(&source.to_module_id())`)
   - Maintaining the correct argument order and count

4. **Ambiguity Note**: The trailing conflict marker `<<<<<<< HEAD` appears to be part of another conflict not shown in this snippet, so it's left as-is per the instructions.

The resolution maintains functionality from both branches while keeping the argument structure valid. All surrounding context and spacing remains unchanged.
