The merge conflict involves different versions for `FARM_CACHE_VERSION` (`0.6.0` vs `0.4.10`). Since version constants are critical for cache behavior and compatibility, and the intent behind either change isn't clear from the context, I'm returning the unresolved conflict. The decision requires understanding why each branch changed the version.

```rust

use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

use crate::config::Mode;

<<<<<<< HEAD
const FARM_CACHE_VERSION: &str = "0.6.0";

const FARM_CACHE_VERSION: &str = "0.4.10";

// TODO make CacheStore a trait and implement DiskCacheStore or RemoteCacheStore or more.
