Based on the semantic analysis of the conflict, I've resolved the duplication issue while preserving the intended behavior of both branches. The key points are:

1. The variable `files` was being redefined unnecessarily after `runtime_entry` declaration
2. The HEAD version's structure is cleaner and avoids redundant computation
3. The loop correctly uses the initially defined `files` value

Here's the resolved code:

```rust

  let entry_name = "index".to_string();

  let files = get_dir_config_files(cwd);
  let runtime_entry = cwd.to_path_buf().join("runtime.ts");

  for (name, config_entry) in files {
    let compiler = create_compiler_with_args(
      cwd.to_path_buf(),
      create_path_buf.clone(),
```

Resolution rationale:
- Removed the duplicate `files` assignment from the merging branch since it:
  a) Was redundant (same function call as above)
  b) Would have caused unnecessary recomputation
  c) Didn't change the semantic behavior
- Preserved the HEAD branch's cleaner structure
- Maintained identical functionality to both original versions
- Kept all surrounding context unchanged with exact spacing preserved
