```rust
          test: vec![ConfigRegex::new(".+")],
          name: "index".to_string(),
        }];

        config = try_merge_config_file(config, config_entry);
<<<<<<< HEAD

        if let Some(f) = f.as_ref() {
          f(&mut config);
        }

        (config, plugins)
      },
    );


```

The conflict resolution requires semantic understanding of both changes:
1. The HEAD commit introduces a closure call `f(&mut config)` that mutates configuration
2. The other branch completely removes this configuration mutation

Since these are fundamentally incompatible changes (one adds behavior the other removes it), and there's no contextual information about:
- The purpose of `f`
- Why one branch would add/remove this mutation
- Whether these changes can coexist

The conflict cannot be automatically resolved. The user must decide whether:
- To keep the configuration mutation (HEAD version)
- Remove it (other branch version)
- Find a third way to handle configuration modification

The surrounding context is preserved exactly as provided.
