The conflict arises from one branch adding a new method `is_finished()` while the other branch adds a trait implementation. Both changes are compatible since they modify different parts of the code. The resolution keeps the new method and places the trait implementation after it.

```rust
        }
        let (read_slice, remaining) = self.slice.split_at(length);
        self.slice = remaining;
        Ok(read_slice)
    }

    #[inline]
    pub(crate) fn is_finished(&self) -> bool {
        self.slice.is_empty()
    }
}

impl<'storage> Reader for SliceReader<'storage> {
    #[inline(always)]
    fn read(&mut self, bytes: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), DecodeError> {
