To resolve this merge conflict, I'll combine the imports from both branches while removing duplicates. Both branches are adding necessary imports for the module, so we'll merge them into a unified set of import statements.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
use super::penbehaviour::{PenBehaviour, PenProgress};
use crate::engine::{EngineTaskSender, EngineView, EngineViewMut};
use crate::{Camera, Document, DrawOnDocBehaviour, StrokeStore, SurfaceFlags, WidgetFlags};
use piet::RenderContext;
use rnote_compose::color;
use rnote_compose::helpers::AABBHelpers;
use rnote_compose::penhelpers::PenEvent;
use rnote_compose::penpath::Element;

```

Key changes made:
1. Preserved the `super::penbehaviour` import from HEAD
2. Combined both `crate::engine` imports into a single statement
3. Merged the crate-level imports, adding all unique items from both branches
4. Maintained all other imports unchanged
5. Preserved original spacing and formatting

The resolution maintains all necessary imports from both branches while avoiding duplicates, ensuring the code will compile with all required dependencies.
