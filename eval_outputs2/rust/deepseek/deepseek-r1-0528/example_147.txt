Based on the merge conflict, I'll resolve this by combining the imports from both branches while removing duplicates. Here's the resolved version:

```rust
use super::penbehaviour::{PenBehaviour, PenProgress};
use crate::engine::{EngineView, EngineViewMut};
use crate::store::StrokeKey;
use crate::strokes::BrushStroke;
use crate::strokes::Stroke;
use crate::AudioPlayer;
use crate::{Camera, Document, DrawOnDocBehaviour, StrokeStore, SurfaceFlags, WidgetFlags};
use piet::RenderContext;
use rnote_compose::builders::shapebuilderbehaviour::{BuilderProgress, ShapeBuilderCreator};
use rnote_compose::builders::Constraints;
use rnote_compose::builders::{PenPathBuilder, ShapeBuilderBehaviour};
use rnote_compose::penhelpers::PenEvent;
use rnote_compose::penpath::Segment;
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Preserved `AudioPlayer` from HEAD as a separate import
2. Combined the braced imports (`{...}`) from both branches
3. Kept `RenderContext` import from the other branch
4. Removed duplicate `DrawOnDocBehaviour` import
5. Maintained all other unique imports from both branches
6. Preserved original spacing and order of surrounding context

The conflict was straightforward to resolve since both sides were adding new imports without any conflicting changes to existing functionality. The resolution maintains all necessary imports from both branches.
