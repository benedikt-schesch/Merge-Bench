The conflict arises from two changes:
1. HEAD adds a line `let _ = $py;` to suppress unused variable warnings and uses `$($body)*` for the function body
2. The other branch changes the return type to use a crate-relative path `$crate::_detail::Result` and uses `$body` for the function body

The resolution:
- Keeps the crate-relative return type from the other branch for consistency
- Keeps the unused variable suppression from HEAD
- Uses `$body` for the function body (as in the other branch) since it's more flexible
- Wraps everything in a block body to maintain syntax consistency

Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
            $crate::py_coerce_item!{
                impl $class {
                    fn __traverse__(&$slf,
                    $py: $crate::Python,
                    $visit: $crate::py_class::gc::VisitProc)
                    -> $crate::_detail::Result<(), $crate::py_class::gc::TraverseError> {
                        let _ = $py;
                        $body
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        $members $props
    }};
```
