I'll help resolve this merge conflict while preserving the surrounding context exactly as provided. After analyzing both sides of the conflict, I notice the key difference is in the arguments passed to `init_info`:

1. **HEAD version** passes two arguments: `&mut world.components, &mut world.storages`
2. **Incoming branch** passes one argument: `&mut world.components`

The presence of `&mut world.storages` in HEAD suggests a recent change where storage information is needed for bundle initialization. The subsequent `get_bundle_spawner` call uses `&mut world.components` but not `&mut world.storages`, which might indicate that:
- `init_info` requires storage access for initialization
- The spawner only needs component information later

Since both branches modify the same line and the HEAD version includes additional functionality (storages access), I'll keep the HEAD version as it appears to be a more complete implementation that maintains compatibility with the subsequent spawner call.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
        world.flush();

        let (lower, upper) = iter.size_hint();
        let length = upper.unwrap_or(lower);

        let bundle_info = world
            .bundles
            .init_info::<I::Item>(&mut world.components, &mut world.storages);
        world.entities.reserve(length as u32);
        let mut spawner = bundle_info.get_bundle_spawner(
            &mut world.entities,
            &mut world.archetypes,
            &mut world.components,
```

Key resolution points:
1. Maintained the HEAD implementation which includes both arguments
2. Preserved all surrounding context exactly as provided
3. Kept the multi-line formatting for readability
4. Ensured the subsequent spawner call remains unchanged as it works with both implementations

This resolution assumes the HEAD change was intentional and that the `init_info` function in the current codebase requires both parameters. If this assumption is incorrect, manual verification would be needed.
