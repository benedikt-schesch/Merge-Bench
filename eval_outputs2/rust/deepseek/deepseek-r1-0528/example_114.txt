The merge conflict remains unresolved as the intent behind choosing between `OriginStorageDir` and `LocationDataDir` is ambiguous without additional context. Both types serve a similar purpose (providing a storage path), but it's unclear which one should be prioritized in the merged codebase. Here's the unchanged snippet with the conflict markers preserved:

```rust
  state: &mut OpState,
  persistent: bool,
) -> Result<&Connection, AnyError> {
  let conn = if persistent {
    if state.try_borrow::<LocalStorage>().is_none() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      let path = state.try_borrow::<OriginStorageDir>().ok_or_else(|| {
=======
      let path = state.try_borrow::<LocationDataDir>().ok_or_else(|| {

        DomExceptionNotSupportedError::new(
          "LocalStorage is not supported in this context.",
        )
      })?;
      std::fs::create_dir_all(&path.0)?;
```
