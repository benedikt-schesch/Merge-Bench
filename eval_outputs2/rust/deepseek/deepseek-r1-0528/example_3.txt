```rust

/// A spotify client
pub struct Client {
    session: Session,
    spotify: Spotify,
<<<<<<< HEAD
    http: reqwest::Client,
=======
    http: reqwest::blocking::Client,
    oauth: SpotifyOAuth,
>>>>>>> d291d456a6ab54e316adf9ce40bdd6f2fa529f7a
}

impl Client {
    /// creates the new `Client` given a spotify authorization
    pub fn new(session: Session, spotify: Spotify) -> Self {

```

The conflict cannot be automatically resolved due to ambiguous intent:
1. The `HEAD` branch uses an async `reqwest::Client`
2. The other branch uses a blocking `reqwest::blocking::Client` and adds an `oauth` field
3. The `new()` function signature doesn't provide initialization clues
4. The approaches represent fundamentally different execution models (async vs blocking)

This requires manual resolution to determine:
- Whether the client should be async or blocking
- If both HTTP models need to be supported
- How the `oauth` field should be initialized
- Why the branches diverged in functionality

The merge conflict markers should be retained until these design decisions are made.
