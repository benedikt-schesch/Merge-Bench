Here's the resolved snippet with the merge conflict handled semantically by combining both sets of match arms:

```rust
      }
      _ => {}
    };

    let flags = match &args.command {
      Permissions { flags, .. } => flags,
      Boundaries { flags } => flags,
      Stepper { flags, .. } => flags,
      Interpreter { flags, .. } => flags,
      _ => unreachable!(),
    };

    RustcPluginArgs {
      flags: Some(flags.clone()),
```

### Resolution Explanation:
1. **Semantic Analysis**: 
   - Both branches are trying to extract `flags` from different enum variants
   - HEAD branch handles `Permissions` and `Interpreter` variants
   - Incoming branch handles `Boundaries`, `Stepper` and `Interpreter` variants
   - `Interpreter` variant exists in both, but with different field patterns

2. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Combined all unique variants from both branches (`Permissions`, `Boundaries`, `Stepper`, `Interpreter`)
   - Used more permissive `..` pattern for `Interpreter` to accommodate both versions
   - Maintained all variant patterns exactly as they appeared in their respective branches
   - Preserved the unreachable fallback since all valid cases are now handled

3. **Preservation Guarantees**:
   - Maintained original spacing and formatting
   - Kept all surrounding context unchanged
   - Resolved conflict by union of both branches' logic
   - Final solution handles all cases from both versions of the code
