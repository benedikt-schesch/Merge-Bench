Based on the semantic analysis of the merge conflict, I've resolved the conflict by preserving the comment that explains the dependency relationship. Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
    exit_code: 0
    ----- stdout -----
    # This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
    #    uv pip compile requirements.in --cache-dir [CACHE_DIR]
    jinja2==3.1.2
        # via -r requirements.in
    markupsafe==2.1.5
        # via jinja2

    ----- stderr -----
    Resolved 2 packages in [TIME]

```

### Resolution Explanation:
1. **Semantic Understanding**: Both branches agree on:
   - The autogenerated header
   - Package versions (jinja2==3.1.2 and markupsafe==2.1.5)
   - Dependency relationship for markupsafe (`# via jinja2`)
   - The stderr output

2. **Conflict Analysis**:
   - The `<<<<<<< HEAD` version includes a valuable comment `# via -r requirements.in` explaining why jinja2 is included
   - The `>>>>>>> fab8d85` version lacks this explanatory comment
   - The comment provides useful semantic information about the dependency origin

3. **Resolution Choice**:
   - Kept the HEAD version's comment as it adds meaningful context
   - Maintained consistency with markupsafe's dependency comment format
   - Preserved all surrounding context exactly as provided
   - This follows semantic versioning best practices where dependency origins should be explicitly documented

The resolved version maintains the integrity of the autogenerated file while preserving valuable dependency information.
