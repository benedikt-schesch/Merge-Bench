The merge conflict involves two different approaches to optimizing the execution plan. The key changes are:

1. The HEAD branch introduced two optimization steps (JoinSelection and AggregateStatistics) using a SessionConfig instance
2. The other branch changed how the configuration is passed to the JoinSelection optimizer (using default options)

The resolution preserves both optimizations while using the improved configuration approach from the other branch. It:
1. Keeps both optimizers (JoinSelection and AggregateStatistics)
2. Creates a default SessionConfig
3. Uses cfg.options() for join optimization (matching the other branch)
4. Uses &cfg for aggregate optimization (matching HEAD)
5. Maintains type annotations for clarity

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
            &input_locations,
        )?;

        // Optimize plan based on new resolved statistics
        let optimize_join = JoinSelection::new();
        let optimize_aggregate = AggregateStatistics::new();

        let cfg: SessionConfig = SessionConfig::default();

        let plan: Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan> = optimize_join.optimize(plan, cfg.options())?;
        let plan: Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan> = optimize_aggregate.optimize(plan, &cfg)?;

        Ok(ResolvedStage::new(
            self.stage_id,
            self.stage_attempt_num,
            plan,
```
