I've analyzed the semantic intent behind both sides of the merge conflict. The key difference is in the condition for displaying the message:

1. **HEAD version** (`> 1`) only shows the message when 2+ paths were processed
2. **Branch version** (`> 0`) shows the message for any non-zero number of paths

Given the message content `"{} path(s) loaded, {} skipped"`:
- The pluralization `(s)` handles both singular and plural cases
- Showing the message for even a single path provides useful feedback
- The branch version's condition is more semantically appropriate since any non-zero operation count deserves feedback

Here's the resolved code preserving all context and spacing:

```rust
                    self.unimplemented();
                }

                match self.edit(paths) {
                    Ok((success_count, fail_count)) => {
                        if success_count + fail_count > 0 {
                            self.message(
                                format!(
                                    "{} path(s) loaded, {} skipped",
                                    success_count, fail_count
                                ),
```
