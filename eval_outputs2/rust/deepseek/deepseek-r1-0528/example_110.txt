Based on the semantic analysis of the conflict, here's the resolved version. The key decisions are:

1. Kept the HEAD version's docstring with period for grammatical correctness
2. Kept the HEAD version's `#[derive(Debug)]` attribute as it provides valuable debugging capability
3. Maintained all surrounding context exactly as provided

```rust
    pub fn elapsed(&self) -> Duration {
        self.state.lock().unwrap().started.elapsed()
    }
}

/// Manages multiple progress bars from different threads.
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct MultiProgress {
    state: Arc<RwLock<MultiProgressState>>,
}

impl Default for MultiProgress {
```

The resolution preserves:
- The grammatical period in the docstring from HEAD
- The `#[derive(Debug)]` attribute from HEAD
- All surrounding code and spacing exactly as in the original snippet
- The semantic intent of both branches (documentation clarity + debug capability)

The conflict was resolvable because:
1. The docstring period improves readability without changing meaning
2. The Debug derivation is additive functionality that doesn't conflict with the other branch's changes
3. Both changes affect the same lines but are semantically compatible
