The merge conflict involves the inclusion of Tokio imports in the HEAD branch that are absent in the other branch. Since the surrounding context doesn't provide enough information about whether Tokio is actually needed in the codebase, and there's no clear semantic relationship between the imports and the subsequent constants, the conflict remains unresolved due to ambiguity.
