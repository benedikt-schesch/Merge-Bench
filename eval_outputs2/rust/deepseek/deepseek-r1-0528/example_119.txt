Since the intent behind the conflicting imports is ambiguous without more context, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact. Both branches appear to be importing similar types (`Coords` and `VarName`) but from different modules (`dynval` vs `value`) with different additional types (`NumWithUnit`, `DynVal` vs `PrimVal`). Without knowing the project structure or semantic relationship between these modules, it's unclear whether these are competing changes or compatible additions.

Here's the preserved snippet with conflict markers:

```rust
use crate::{
    config,
    config::{window_definition::WindowName, AnchorPoint},
    display_backend, eww_state,
    script_var_handler::*,
<<<<<<< HEAD:crates/eww/src/app.rs
    dynval::{Coords, NumWithUnit, DynVal, VarName},
=======
    value::{Coords, PrimVal, VarName},
>>>>>>> db9e673b81d0d85dccc1aee2c8dd19cb7ca460e5:src/app.rs
    EwwPaths,
};
use anyhow::*;
use debug_stub_derive::*;
use gdk::WindowExt;

```
