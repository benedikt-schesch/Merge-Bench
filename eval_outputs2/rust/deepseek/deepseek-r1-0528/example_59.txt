Since the conflict involves an import statement with an extra type in one branch (`ComponentStorage`) and I don't have enough context about why it was added or removed, the intent is ambiguous. Both branches might be making valid changes (one adding a needed import, another cleaning up unused imports). Without knowing the actual usage of `ComponentStorage` in the codebase, I can't determine which change is semantically correct.

Here's the original conflicted snippet preserved exactly as provided:

```rust
use crate::{
    archetype::{Archetype, ArchetypeComponentId},
<<<<<<< HEAD
    component::{Component, ComponentId, ComponentStorage, ComponentTicks, StorageType},
=======
    component::{Component, ComponentId, ComponentTicks, StorageType},
>>>>>>> 65e834ce8d5142f1a01d06c2a9e4e7ef4a1238a9
    entity::Entity,
    query::{Access, Fetch, FetchState, FilteredAccess, WorldQuery},
    storage::{ComponentSparseSet, Table, Tables},
    world::World,
};
```
