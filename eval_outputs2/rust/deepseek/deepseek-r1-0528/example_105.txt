Based on the semantic analysis of both changes, the resolution incorporates the following:

1. The `ignore_unused` field from HEAD is preserved as it represents new functionality
2. The `&*DEFAULT_DIR` argument from the other branch is preserved as it provides necessary context
3. The struct pattern now matches the updated `LocalIdl` definition with 4 fields

Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
            for idl in entry.idls {
                let LocalIdl {
                    path,
                    includes,
                    touch,
                    ignore_unused,
                } = get_or_download_idl(idl, &*DEFAULT_DIR)?;

                builder = builder
                    .add_service(path.clone())
                    .includes(includes)
                    .touch([(path, touch)])
```

Explanation:
- The `ignore_unused` field is maintained from HEAD since it represents additional functionality being tracked
- The `DEFAULT_DIR` argument is kept from the other branch as it provides necessary context for the function call
- The spacing and surrounding context are preserved exactly as in the original
- This resolution assumes the `get_or_download_idl` function in the merged codebase both:
  1. Accepts the `DEFAULT_DIR` argument
  2. Returns a struct containing the `ignore_unused` field
