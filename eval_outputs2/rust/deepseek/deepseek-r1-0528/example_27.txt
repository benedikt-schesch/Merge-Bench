The conflict arises from both branches adding different imports to the same location. The semantic intent is:
1. HEAD adds `std::path::Path` and `std::str::FromStr` (nested import)
2. Other branch adds `std::borrow::Cow` and `std::str::FromStr` (separate imports)

The resolution combines both intents by:
1. Keeping `std::str::FromStr` (common to both)
2. Adding `std::borrow::Cow` from the other branch
3. Keeping `std::path::Path` from HEAD
4. Using a single nested import for all three items

Resolved code:
```rust
use std::{borrow::Cow, path::Path, str::FromStr};

use once_cell::sync::Lazy;
use regex::Regex;
use serde::{de, Deserialize, Deserializer, Serialize};
use tracing::warn;

```
