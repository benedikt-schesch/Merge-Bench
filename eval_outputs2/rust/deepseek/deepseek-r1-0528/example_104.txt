The conflict involves an import statement where both branches have similar imports but with one key difference. The HEAD branch includes `binary::TAsyncBinaryProtocol` while the other branch does not. Since the HEAD branch explicitly added this import and the other branch made no changes to it (only reformatting existing imports), the resolution keeps `binary::TAsyncBinaryProtocol` to preserve the HEAD branch's intentional addition.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```rust
use std::fmt::{self, Display, Formatter};

use pilota::thrift::{
    binary::TAsyncBinaryProtocol, Error as PilotaError, Message, ProtocolError,
    TAsyncInputProtocol, TFieldIdentifier, TInputProtocol, TLengthProtocol, TOutputProtocol,
    TStructIdentifier, TType, TransportError,
};
use volo::loadbalance::error::{LoadBalanceError, Retryable};

use crate::AnyhowError;
```
