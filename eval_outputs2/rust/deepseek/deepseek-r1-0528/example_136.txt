The merge conflict involves two different parameter sets in the function signature. The HEAD branch includes `is_already_polyfilled` and `ctx`, while the other branch includes `is_patch_esm_flag` instead. The function body references `ctx.options.format`, which means `ctx` is required for compilation. However, it's unclear if:

1. `is_patch_esm_flag` is a replacement for `is_already_polyfilled`
2. Both flags are needed simultaneously
3. The `ctx` parameter is intentionally removed in the other branch

Since the function body depends on `ctx` and the relationship between the flags is ambiguous, I'm unable to safely resolve this conflict. Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:
