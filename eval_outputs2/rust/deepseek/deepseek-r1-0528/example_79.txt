I've analyzed the merge conflict and found that the intent is ambiguous. The conflict involves two different changes to the cursor-related fields:

1. The HEAD branch adds `physical_cursor_position: Option<DVec2>`
2. The other branch adds both `cursor_position: Option<Vec2>` and `raw_window_handle: RawWindowHandleWrapper`

These appear to be semantically different changes that can't be automatically reconciled:
- The cursor position fields have different names and types (`DVec2` vs `Vec2`)
- The other branch adds an entirely new field (`raw_window_handle`)
- It's unclear if these cursor fields are meant to coexist or replace each other

Since the intent is ambiguous, I'm returning the original snippet with the conflict markers preserved:

    vsync: bool,
    resizable: bool,
    decorations: bool,
    cursor_visible: bool,
