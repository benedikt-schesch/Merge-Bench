I've analyzed the provided merge conflict. The conflict occurs in two separate sections:

1. The first conflict is about an `extern crate user_lib;` declaration - present in HEAD but absent in the other branch
2. The second conflict is about a `use` statement importing from user_lib - present in HEAD but absent in the other branch

After considering both sides:
- The `extern crate alloc;` declaration appears to be common to both branches
- The second `extern crate user_lib;` appears to be common to both branches
- The `use` statement exists only in HEAD

Since the intent behind removing the `use` statement in the other branch is unclear (it might be intentional removal or part of a larger refactoring), and we don't have enough context to determine if this import is still needed, I'm leaving the conflict unresolved.

The exact original code with preserved conflicts:

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

<<<<<<< HEAD
extern crate user_lib;
=======
>>>>>>> 59480f5d0d3e107a6abbe4bf061f32f0ab92dc7f
extern crate alloc;
extern crate user_lib;

<<<<<<< HEAD
use user_lib::{VIRTGPU_XRES, VIRTGPU_YRES, Display};
