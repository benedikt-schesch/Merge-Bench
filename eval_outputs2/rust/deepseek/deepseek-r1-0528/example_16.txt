The conflict involves the construction of an `AggregateFunction` struct where one branch adds a new field `null_treatment` while the other branch does not. The intent of the changes is ambiguous because:

1. The `null_treatment` field appears to be a meaningful addition (likely handling NULL semantics in window functions)
2. However, the HEAD branch context doesn't define `null_treatment`, suggesting the struct might not support this field
3. Without knowing if the struct definition was updated in either branch, we can't safely determine if this field should be included

Since the intent is ambiguous and we can't verify struct compatibility, the conflict remains unresolved. Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```rust
                        ),
                        args: vec![lit(COUNT_STAR_EXPANSION)],
                        partition_by,
                        order_by,
                        window_frame,
<<<<<<< HEAD
                    }))
=======
                        null_treatment,
                    })
>>>>>>> 3b355c798a3258f118016b33f26c5a55fed36220
                }

                _ => Transformed::no(old_expr),
            },
            Expr::AggregateFunction(AggregateFunction {
