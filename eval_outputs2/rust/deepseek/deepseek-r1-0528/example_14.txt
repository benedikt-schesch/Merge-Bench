I'll help resolve this merge conflict while preserving the context and intent of both branches. The conflict involves imports from `datafusion_common`, specifically:

1. `tree_node` imports: HEAD uses `TreeNodeRecursion` while the other branch uses `VisitRecursion`
2. `datafusion_common` imports: HEAD includes `DataFusionError` while the other branch omits it

After analyzing the semantics:
- `VisitRecursion` was renamed to `TreeNodeRecursion` in recent DataFusion versions
- `DataFusionError` isn't directly used in the imports shown but might be needed for error handling

Here's the resolved version:

```rust
// specific language governing permissions and limitations
// under the License.

use crate::analyzer::check_plan;
use crate::utils::collect_subquery_cols;
use datafusion_common::tree_node::{TreeNode, TreeNodeRecursion};
use datafusion_common::{plan_err, DataFusionError, Result};
use datafusion_expr::expr_rewriter::strip_outer_reference;
use datafusion_expr::utils::split_conjunction;
use datafusion_expr::{
    Aggregate, BinaryExpr, Cast, Expr, Filter, Join, JoinType, LogicalPlan, Operator,
    Window,
```

Justification:
- Kept `TreeNodeRecursion` as it's the current name used in DataFusion
- Retained `DataFusionError` since it's commonly needed for error variants
- Maintained all other context exactly as provided
- Removed conflict markers while preserving both branches' essential functionality
