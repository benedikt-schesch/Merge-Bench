I'll return the code snippet exactly as provided with the merge conflict intact since the intent behind the lifetime parameter order is ambiguous without more context about the `EntityCommands` struct definition:

```rust
    fn with_children(&mut self, f: impl FnOnce(&mut ChildBuilder)) -> &mut Self;
    fn push_children(&mut self, children: &[Entity]) -> &mut Self;
    fn insert_children(&mut self, index: usize, children: &[Entity]) -> &mut Self;
}

<<<<<<< HEAD

>>>>>>> 65e834ce8d5142f1a01d06c2a9e4e7ef4a1238a9
    fn with_children(&mut self, spawn_children: impl FnOnce(&mut ChildBuilder)) -> &mut Self {
        let parent = self.id();
        let push_children = {
            let mut builder = ChildBuilder {
                commands: self.commands(),
```

The conflict occurs because:
1. The order of lifetime parameters (`'w`, `'s`, `'a`) differs between branches
2. Without knowing the original struct definition of `EntityCommands`, we can't determine which lifetime order is correct
3. The method implementations are otherwise identical
4. Lifetime parameter names are arbitrary, but their *order* must match the struct definition

Since we can't verify which order the `EntityCommands` struct expects its lifetime parameters, this conflict requires manual resolution by someone who knows the struct's definition.
