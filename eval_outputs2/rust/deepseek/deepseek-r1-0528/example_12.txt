The conflict arises from two different approaches to transforming the execution plan. The HEAD branch performs additional integrity checks after transformation but uses an undefined variable `pipeline`, while the other branch correctly uses the input `plan` but lacks integrity verification. 

The resolution:
1. Uses the correct `plan` input variable
2. Combines transformation and integrity checking
3. Maintains `new_plan` variable for subsequent transformations
4. Preserves all surrounding context

Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
    pub(crate) fn crosscheck_plans(plan: Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>) -> Result<()> {
        let subrules: Vec<Box<PipelineFixerSubrule>> = vec![
            Box::new(hash_join_convert_symmetric_subrule),
            Box::new(hash_join_swap_subrule),
        ];
        let new_plan = plan
            .transform_up(&|p| apply_subrules(p, &subrules, &ConfigOptions::new()))?
            .data;
        check_integrity(&new_plan)?;
        // TODO: End state payloads will be checked here.
        let config = ConfigOptions::new().optimizer;
        let collect_left_threshold = config.hash_join_single_partition_threshold;
        let collect_threshold_num_rows = config.hash_join_single_partition_threshold_rows;
        let _ = new_plan.transform_up(&|plan| {
