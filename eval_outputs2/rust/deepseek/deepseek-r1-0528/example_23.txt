Here's the resolved snippet with the merge conflict handled by preserving both implementations since they serve different types and purposes:

```rust
    fn eq(&self, other: &ConflictKindRef<'a>) -> bool {
        self.as_ref() == *other
    }
}

impl<'a> hashbrown::Equivalent<ConflictKind> for ConflictKindRef<'a> {
    fn equivalent(&self, key: &ConflictKind) -> bool {
        key.as_ref() == *self
    }
}

impl hashbrown::Equivalent<ConflictPackage> for ConflictPackageRef<'_> {
    fn equivalent(&self, key: &ConflictPackage) -> bool {
        key.as_ref() == *self
    }
}

/// An error that occurs when the given conflicting set is invalid somehow.
```

### Resolution Reasoning:
1. **Different Types**: The HEAD implementation handles `ConflictKind`/`ConflictKindRef`, while the other branch handles `ConflictPackage`/`ConflictPackageRef`
2. **Semantic Independence**: Both implementations are valid and serve distinct purposes (no overlap in functionality)
3. **Preservation**: Maintained both implementations exactly as they appeared in their respective branches
4. **Ordering**: Kept HEAD's implementation first since it appeared first in the conflict, followed by the other branch's implementation
5. **Formatting**: Preserved original spacing and syntax, including:
   - Lifetime annotations (`'a` vs `'_`)
   - Trait bounds
   - Method implementations
   - Comment positioning

The conflict arose because two separate features added similar trait implementations for different types at the same location. Since there's no actual overlap in functionality, both can coexist safely.
