Based on the provided context, I'll resolve the merge conflict by keeping the `use anyhow::Result;` statement. Both branches are adding imports, and the `anyhow::Result` import doesn't conflict with the other imports from the second branch. The removal in the second branch was likely accidental or part of a cleanup that isn't critical for functionality.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
//! Analysis for finding expected vs actual permission on path usage.
mod path_visitor;

use anyhow::Result;
use either::Either;
use flowistry::mir::utils::{OperandExt, SpanExt};
use path_visitor::get_path_boundaries;
use rustc_hir::HirId;
use rustc_middle::mir::{Rvalue, Statement, StatementKind};
```
