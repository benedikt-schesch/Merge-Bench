The conflict arises from differing documentation comments for the `shortcut_keys` field in the `Up` event variant. After analyzing both changes:

1. The HEAD version incorrectly references "proximity event" for a field in the `Up` variant
2. The other branch fixes the event reference but uses "whether a shortcut key is pressed" which doesn't match the `Vec<ShortcutKey>` type
3. Both sides agree on keeping the `shortcut_keys` field itself

Resolution combines accuracy from both sides:
- Corrects "proximity" to "up" event from the other branch
- Keeps "pressed shortcut keys" from HEAD which matches the vector type
- Maintains the surrounding context unchanged

Resolved code:

```rust
    },
    /// A pen up event.
    Up {
        /// The element for the down event
        element: Element,
        /// pressed shortcut keys during the up event
        shortcut_keys: Vec<ShortcutKey>,
    },
    /// A pen down event. Is repeatedly emitted while the pen is in proximity and moved
    Proximity {
        /// The element for the proximity event
```
