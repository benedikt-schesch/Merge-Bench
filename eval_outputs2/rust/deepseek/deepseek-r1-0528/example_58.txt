Based on the provided code snippet, I'll return the exact content with the merge conflict markers preserved since the intent appears ambiguous. The conflict revolves around whether the `storage_type` field should be included in the clone implementation, and without seeing the full struct definition or additional context, it's unclear if this field exists in both branches or was added/removed in one branch.

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers maintained:

```rust
}

impl<T> Clone for ChangeTrackersFetch<T> {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        Self {
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
            storage_type: self.storage_type,
>>>>>>> 65e834ce8d5142f1a01d06c2a9e4e7ef4a1238a9
            table_ticks: self.table_ticks,
            entity_table_rows: self.entity_table_rows,
            entities: self.entities,
            sparse_set: self.sparse_set,
            marker: self.marker,
```

**Reasoning for preserving conflict:**
1. The conflict shows `storage_type` being added in one branch but absent in the other
2. Without knowing the struct definition of `ChangeTrackersFetch<T>`, we can't determine if:
   - `storage_type` is a new field being added (resolve by keeping it)
   - `storage_type` was removed in HEAD (resolve by omitting it)
   - The field exists in both versions but was forgotten in the clone impl (resolve by keeping it)
3. The surrounding fields are identical in both branches, suggesting the conflict is isolated to this specific field
4. Semantic intent is unclear without broader context
