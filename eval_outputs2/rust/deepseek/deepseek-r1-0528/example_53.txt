The conflict arises from differing trait bounds on `T` for `EventWriter`. In Bevy's ECS:
- `Resource` indicates global data storage
- `Component` indicates entity-attached data

Events are stored in a global resource (`Events<T>`), not as components. The `HEAD` version correctly uses `T: Resource` since:
1. `Events<T>` is always a resource
2. Event types don't need component capabilities
3. `Resource` bound satisfies `Events<T>`'s requirements

Here's the resolved snippet preserving all context:

```rust
    events: Res<'w, Events<T>>,
}

/// Sends events of type `T`.
#[derive(SystemParam)]
pub struct EventWriter<'w, 's, T: Resource> {
    events: ResMut<'w, Events<T>>,
    #[system_param(ignore)]
    marker: PhantomData<&'s usize>,
}

```
