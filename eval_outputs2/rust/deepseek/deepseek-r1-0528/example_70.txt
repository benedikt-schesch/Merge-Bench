The conflict arises from differing trait bounds for `T` in `ResState`. The HEAD branch requires `T: Resource`, while the incoming change requires `T: Component`. Considering the associated type is `Res<'w, T>` (which typically accesses resources in Bevy ECS), the `Resource` bound is semantically appropriate. Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
    }

    fn default_config() {}
}

impl<'w, 's, T: Resource> SystemParamFetch<'w, 's> for ResState<T> {
    type Item = Res<'w, T>;

    #[inline]
    unsafe fn get_param(
        state: &'s mut Self,
```

Key resolution points:
1. `Res<'w, T>` is a resource accessor, making `T: Resource` the correct bound
2. `Component` bound would be appropriate for query-based access, but doesn't match `Res` type
3. The surrounding context remains unchanged to preserve functionality
4. Conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) are removed after resolution
