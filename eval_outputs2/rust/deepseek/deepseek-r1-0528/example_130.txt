The conflict arises from redundant field initialization in the struct. Both sides set `output_file`, but the other branch duplicates it. The HEAD version correctly uses `..Default::default()` to handle remaining fields. The resolution keeps the HEAD version since it's semantically correct and avoids duplication.

Resolved snippet:
```rust
      &compiler,
      AssertCompilerResultConfig {
        entry_name: Some(entry_name.clone()),
        output_file: Some(format_output_name(name)),
        ignore_emitted_field: false,
        ..Default::default()
      },
    );
  }
}
```
