```rust
                    brushstroke.update_geometry();
                    self.key_tree.update_with_key(key, stroke.bounds());

                    self.set_rendering_dirty(key);
                }
                Stroke::ShapeStroke(ref mut shapestroke) => {
                    shapestroke.update_geometry();
                    self.key_tree.update_with_key(key, stroke.bounds());

                    self.set_rendering_dirty(key);
                }
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
Both branches perform identical operations after pattern matching, but differ in how they bind the `shapestroke` pattern. The key semantic difference is:
1. The `HEAD` version (`ref mut shapestroke`) correctly borrows a mutable reference to the enum's inner data
2. The alternative branch would attempt to move the value out of the enum (invalid since we're matching on a reference)

Since `update_geometry()` requires mutable access, the `ref mut` binding from `HEAD` is necessary to preserve:
- The ability to mutate `shapestroke`
- Rust's borrowing rules (prevents moving out of borrowed context)
- Consistency with the `BrushStroke` arm above

The resolved version maintains the required mutability while keeping identical functionality to both branches.
