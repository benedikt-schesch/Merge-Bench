I'll resolve this semantic merge conflict by preserving the documentation improvements while maintaining correctness. The conflict is about how to reference Bevy's plugin groups in documentation. Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
    /// Adds a group of plugins
    ///
    /// Bevy plugins can be grouped into a set of plugins. Bevy provides
    /// built-in PluginGroups that provide core engine functionality.
    ///
    /// The plugin groups available by default are [`DefaultPlugins`] and [`MinimalPlugins`].
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// ```
    /// # use bevy_app::{prelude::*, PluginGroupBuilder};
    /// #
```

The resolution:
1. Keeps the Markdown link syntax `[`...`]` from the branch version since it properly links to the actual types in generated documentation
2. Preserves the correct type names `DefaultPlugins` and `MinimalPlugins` from both versions
3. Maintains all surrounding context and spacing exactly as provided
4. Removes the conflict markers while keeping the most semantically valuable version

The branch version's use of Rustdoc linking syntax is preferred as it provides better documentation functionality while conveying the same information as the HEAD version. This maintains both the intent to document available plugins and the improvement for documentation usability.
