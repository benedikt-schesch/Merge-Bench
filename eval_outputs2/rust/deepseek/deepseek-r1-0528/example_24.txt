The merge conflict involves two branches making changes to the same struct initialization block. The HEAD branch adds two new fields (`parent` and `specifier`) while the other branch (02345a5a) does not include these fields. 

Since there's no context about the struct definition or which branch represents the authoritative version, the intent is ambiguous. The fields could be:
1. New required fields added in HEAD that would break the other branch's version
2. Optional fields that could be safely omitted
3. Fields being removed in the other branch

Without knowing the current struct definition or the evolution history, I cannot determine which version is correct. Therefore, I'm returning the unresolved conflict for manual resolution:

```rust
                                extra: None,
                                dev: None,
                                marker,
                            }),
                            version: Range::singleton(version.clone()),
<<<<<<< HEAD
                            parent: None,
                            specifier: None,

                        })
                        .collect(),
                ));
            }

```
