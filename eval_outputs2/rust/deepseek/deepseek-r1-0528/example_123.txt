The conflict arises from differing approaches to setting the virtual terminal. The HEAD version conditionally executes `set_virtual_terminal` only on Windows using `#[cfg(windows)]`, while the other branch executes it unconditionally. 

After analyzing the semantics:
1. The unconditional call could cause issues on non-Windows platforms if `set_virtual_terminal` isn't implemented
2. The conditional approach maintains platform safety
3. The blank line after the call in HEAD improves readability

The resolved version preserves the conditional execution while maintaining the original spacing:

```rust
    });
}

impl Repl {
    fn new(ide_mode: bool) -> Result<Repl, Error> {
        #[cfg(windows)]
        let _ret = control::set_virtual_terminal(true);

        let (command_context, outputs) = CommandContext::new()?;
        send_output(outputs.stdout, io::stdout(), None);
        send_output(outputs.stderr, io::stderr(), Some(Color::BrightRed));
        let mut repl = Repl {
            command_context,
