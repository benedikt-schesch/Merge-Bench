The conflict involves two different logging mechanisms:
1. HEAD branch uses a Rust closure-based logger (`logger`)
2. Other branch uses a C-compatible function pointer (`log`)

The intent appears to be providing logging capabilities, but the implementations are fundamentally incompatible in terms of:
- Type signatures (closure vs C function)
- Memory management (boxed trait object vs raw pointer)
- Safety requirements (`unsafe` requirement in C version)

Since the approaches are semantically different and the resolution would require choosing one paradigm over the other (Rust-native vs FFI-compatible), the conflict cannot be automatically resolved without knowing the project's direction.

Here is the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```rust
    sessions: [Arc<spin::RwLock<Option<session::Session>>>; N_SESSIONS], // The N_SESSIONS most recent sessions, index is session id modulo N_SESSIONS
    current: AtomicUsize, // Index of most recently used session
    packet_queue: spin::Mutex<VecDeque<Vec<u8>>>, // Queue to store blocked packets
    timers: timers::Timers, // Keeps tabs on the expiring timers

<<<<<<< HEAD
    logger: Option<spin::Mutex<Box<Fn(&str) + Send>>>,
=======
    log: Option<unsafe extern "C" fn(*const c_char)>, // Pointer to an external log function
