I've analyzed the merge conflict and determined that the intent is ambiguous. The HEAD version uses multiple closing parentheses `))))`, while the other branch adds a `null_treatment` argument and returns `Ok(expr)`. Without additional context about what `expr` refers to or the overall function structure, I can't safely resolve this conflict.

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved as requested:

```rust
                    fun,
                    args,
                    partition_by,
                    order_by,
                    window_frame,
<<<<<<< HEAD
                ))))
=======
                    null_treatment,
                ));
                Ok(expr)
>>>>>>> 3b355c798a3258f118016b33f26c5a55fed36220
            }
            Expr::Alias(_)
            | Expr::Column(_)
            | Expr::ScalarVariable(_, _)
            | Expr::Literal(_)
```

Key ambiguities preventing resolution:
1. The HEAD version's `))))` suggests a different nesting structure
2. The branch version's `expr` variable isn't defined in this context
3. The return type (`Ok(expr)` vs implicit return) conflict isn't resolvable without seeing the function signature
4. The `null_treatment` argument appears to be a new feature but its integration is unclear

A human developer should resolve this by:
1. Determining if `null_treatment` should be included
2. Verifying the correct nesting level for parentheses
3. Deciding between explicit `Ok()` return or implicit return
4. Ensuring `expr` is properly initialized if used
