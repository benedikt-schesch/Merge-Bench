I've analyzed the merge conflict and found that the intent is ambiguous. The changes involve both the method called on `program` (`mutate` vs `visit_mut_with`) and the arguments passed to `default_config`. There's also ambiguity around whether `unresolved_mark` should be preserved or if the new `param.module_id` argument replaces its functionality. Since the semantics aren't clear, I'm returning the original code with the conflict intact.

Here's the exact snippet with preserved context:

```rust
          TsxConfig::default(),
          comments,
          unresolved_mark,
          top_level_mark,
        ));
<<<<<<< HEAD
        program.mutate(&mut typescript(
          default_config(&context.config.script),
          unresolved_mark,
=======
        program.visit_mut_with(&mut typescript(
          default_config(&context.config.script, param.module_id),
>>>>>>> 24a95b48172836d31c55697037d5dada7d9c1ef7
          top_level_mark,
        ));
      }
      _ => {}
    }
```
