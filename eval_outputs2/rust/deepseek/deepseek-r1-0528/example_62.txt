I've analyzed the merge conflict and determined that it cannot be safely resolved without additional context. The conflict revolves around lifetime parameter ordering in the trait implementation, and since I don't have information about the `EntityCommands` struct definition, I can't determine which lifetime order is correct.

Here's the original code with conflict markers preserved:

```rust
pub trait DespawnRecursiveExt {
    /// Despawns the provided entity and its children.
    fn despawn_recursive(self);
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
impl<'w, 's, 'a> DespawnRecursiveExt for EntityCommands<'w, 's, 'a> {
=======
impl<'s, 'w, 'a> DespawnRecursiveExt for EntityCommands<'s, 'w, 'a> {
>>>>>>> 65e834ce8d5142f1a01d06c2a9e4e7ef4a1238a9
    /// Despawns the provided entity and its children.
    fn despawn_recursive(mut self) {
        let entity = self.id();
        self.commands().add(DespawnRecursive { entity });
    }

```

Key reasons why this conflict can't be automatically resolved:
1. The lifetime parameters (`'w`, `'s`, `'a`) appear in different orders in the two branches
2. The correct order depends on the struct definition of `EntityCommands`
3. The method body is identical in both versions, so semantic intent is unclear
4. Without knowing how the lifetimes are used in `EntityCommands`, we can't determine which ordering is correct

To resolve this conflict manually, you would need to:
1. Check the definition of `EntityCommands` to see what lifetime order it expects
2. Verify consistency with other implementations in the codebase
3. Choose the version that matches the struct's lifetime parameter order
4. Remove the conflict markers and keep the correct implementation
