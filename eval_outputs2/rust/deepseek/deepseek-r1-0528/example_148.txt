The conflict arises from different approaches to calculating `page_width`. Both versions aim to compute the width by scaling the document format width by a percentage. The key difference is that one branch explicitly converts `self.document.format.width` to `f64` using `f64::from()`, while the other relies on implicit conversion through multiplication with a float.

After analyzing:
1. Explicit conversion (`f64::from()`) is safer and more explicit
2. It ensures proper floating-point arithmetic regardless of the original type
3. The result is identical to the HEAD version when the width is already float
4. The calculation logic remains semantically consistent with both branches' intent

Here's the resolved version preserving all context:

```rust
        pos: na::Vector2<f64>,
        bytes: Vec<u8>,
    ) -> oneshot::Receiver<anyhow::Result<Vec<Stroke>>> {
        let (oneshot_sender, oneshot_receiver) = oneshot::channel::<anyhow::Result<Vec<Stroke>>>();

        let page_width = (f64::from(self.document.format.width)
            * (self.pdf_import_width_perc / 100.0))
            .round() as i32;

        let pdf_import_as_vector = self.pdf_import_as_vector;

        rayon::spawn(move || {
            let result = || -> anyhow::Result<Vec<Stroke>> {
```
