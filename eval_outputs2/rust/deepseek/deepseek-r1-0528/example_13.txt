The merge conflict involves two different implementations of the `optimize` method. Both versions aim to transform the execution plan using `check_finiteness_requirements`, but they use different approaches:

1. **HEAD version**:
   - Uses `PipelineStatePropagator` to wrap the plan
   - Performs transformation and extracts state
   - Returns `state.plan`

2. **Incoming version**:
   - Directly calls `transform_up` on the plan
   - Returns the result directly

The conflict is semantically ambiguous because:
- The HEAD version uses additional state management (`PipelineStatePropagator`)
- The incoming version uses a simpler direct approach
- Without context about `PipelineStatePropagator`'s purpose, we can't determine if these are equivalent
- The state management in HEAD suggests additional functionality that might be required

Here's the unresolved conflict preserving all context:

```rust
    fn optimize(
        &self,
        plan: Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>,
        config: &ConfigOptions,
    ) -> Result<Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>> {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        let pipeline = PipelineStatePropagator::new_default(plan);
        let state = pipeline
            .transform_up(&|p| check_finiteness_requirements(p, &config.optimizer))?
            .data;
        Ok(state.plan)
=======
        plan.transform_up(&|p| check_finiteness_requirements(p, &config.optimizer))
>>>>>>> e1ca74e7c68e4949504e902f91d2e2b152cfc910
    }

    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "PipelineChecker"
    }
