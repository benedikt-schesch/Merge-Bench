Here's the resolved snippet based on semantic analysis. Both changes appear to be adding independent arguments to the function call. The solution combines both arguments while maintaining the trailing comma style from the HEAD branch:

```rust
      source,
      export,
      bundle_variable,
      module_analyzer_manager,
      polyfill,
      is_already_polyfilled,
      ctx,
      is_patch_esm_flag
    ),
  }
}

/// generate bundle import
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. Both `is_already_polyfilled` and `ctx` (from HEAD) and `is_patch_esm_flag` (from the other branch) appear to be valid, independent arguments
2. The order was determined by:
   - Keeping related polyfill arguments together (`polyfill`, `is_already_polyfilled`)
   - Following with general context (`ctx`)
   - Adding the new ESM flag last as it's the newest addition
3. Trailing comma is maintained after `ctx` for consistency with HEAD style
4. No comma after last argument (`is_patch_esm_flag`) to match Rust convention
5. Both changes are preserved as they serve different semantic purposes
