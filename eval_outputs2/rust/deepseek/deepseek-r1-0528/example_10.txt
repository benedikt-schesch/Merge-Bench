The merge conflict resolution is ambiguous due to significant differences in the implementation approaches. The key points of uncertainty are:

1. **Return Type Handling**:  
   The HEAD branch wraps `simpl_power` in `Transformed::yes()` while the other branch doesn't. This suggests fundamental differences in how transformation results are handled.

2. **Argument Passing**:  
   The HEAD branch clones `info` with `<&S>::clone(&info)` while the other branch uses `info` directly. This indicates potential divergence in ownership handling or type signatures.

Without additional context about:
- The expected return type of the match arm
- The current signature of `simpl_power`
- The type and ownership requirements of `info`
- How other similar functions (like `Concat`) are handled

I cannot safely resolve this conflict. Here's the preserved snippet with the conflict markers:

```rust

            // power
            Expr::ScalarFunction(ScalarFunction {
                func_def: ScalarFunctionDefinition::BuiltIn(BuiltinScalarFunction::Power),
                args,
<<<<<<< HEAD
            }) => Transformed::yes(simpl_power(args, <&S>::clone(&info))?),
=======
            }) => simpl_power(args, info)?,
>>>>>>> 767760b84c71b9af8b2d8cdee9cd5c099b57b462

            // concat
            Expr::ScalarFunction(ScalarFunction {
                func_def: ScalarFunctionDefinition::BuiltIn(BuiltinScalarFunction::Concat),
                args,
