The conflict remains unresolved because the intent is ambiguous:
1. The HEAD branch introduces two new public modules (`array_buffer` and `array_buffer_view`)
2. The other branch completely removes these modules

Without additional context about why these modules were added/removed (e.g., whether they were relocated, deprecated, or if this is a true conflict), I cannot safely resolve this. The surrounding context doesn't provide sufficient semantic clues to determine which change should take precedence.
