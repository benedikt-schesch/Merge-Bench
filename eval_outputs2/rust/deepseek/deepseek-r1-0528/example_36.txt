Based on the provided code snippet, I need to resolve a merge conflict in a Rust destructuring pattern and struct initialization. The conflict revolves around a `path` field in a `Requirement` struct.

After analyzing both sides:
1. The HEAD side includes a `path` field in both the destructuring and struct construction
2. The other branch (7d41e7d) doesn't include this field

Since we don't have the full struct definition, this appears to be an additive change where:
- HEAD likely added a new field (`path`) to the struct
- The other branch doesn't have this field

The semantic resolution is to keep the `path` field since:
1. It's likely a new feature addition
2. Removing it could break functionality in HEAD
3. The struct initialization needs to match the current struct definition

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
        let Requirement {
            name,
            extras,
            version_or_url,
            marker,
            path,
        } = self;
        Requirement {
            name,
            extras,
            version_or_url: match version_or_url {
```
