The merge conflict involves changes to the imports from the `forge_api` module. The HEAD branch added `ChoiceType` and `ConfigOption`, while the other branch added `AppConfig` and removed `ChoiceType` and `ConfigOption`. Since the changes conflict semantically (one side adds items that the other side removes), and the intent behind these changes is ambiguous without more context, I cannot safely resolve this conflict.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust

use anyhow::{Context, Result};
use colored::Colorize;
use convert_case::{Case, Casing};
use forge_api::{
<<<<<<< HEAD
    AgentId, ChatRequest, ChatResponse, ChoiceType, ConfigOption, Conversation, ConversationId,
    Event, InterruptionReason, Model, ModelId, Workflow, API,
=======
    AgentId, AppConfig, ChatRequest, ChatResponse, Conversation, ConversationId, Event,
    InterruptionReason, Model, ModelId, Workflow, API,
>>>>>>> 64e87367dc3f494f1de2be572aa12532180a4dd9
};
use forge_display::{MarkdownFormat, TitleFormat};
use forge_domain::{McpConfig, McpServerConfig, Provider, Scope};
use forge_fs::ForgeFS;
use forge_spinner::SpinnerManager;

```
