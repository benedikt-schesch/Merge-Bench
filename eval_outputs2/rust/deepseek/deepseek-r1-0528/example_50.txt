The conflict arises from differences in formatting an empty function body within a code comment. Both versions are semantically identical, but the formatting differs slightly. The resolved version uses the cleaner, more idiomatic Rust formatting for an empty block (`{ }`) with proper spacing.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
    /// #     }
    /// # }
    /// #
    /// # struct MyOwnPlugin;
    /// # impl Plugin for MyOwnPlugin {
    /// #     fn build(&self, app: &mut App) { }
    /// # }
    /// #
    /// App::new()
    ///      .add_plugins_with(DefaultPlugins, |group| {
    ///             group.add_before::<bevy_log::LogPlugin, _>(MyOwnPlugin)
```

Key resolution points:
1. Removed the semicolon from HEAD (`;`) as it's redundant in an empty block
2. Kept the space inside the braces `{ }` for consistency with idiomatic Rust formatting
3. Added a space before the opening brace `) {` for proper syntax spacing
4. Preserved all surrounding context and indentation exactly as provided

The resolved version maintains the original intent (demonstrating an empty plugin implementation) while using cleaner, more conventional Rust formatting.
