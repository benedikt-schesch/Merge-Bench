The conflict occurs in the trait bounds for the generic type `T` in the `add_state_to_stage` method. The HEAD branch requires `T: StateData`, while the other branch requires a more specific set of traits: `T: Component + Debug + Clone + Eq + Hash`. 

Without knowing the exact definition of `StateData` or the implementation details of `State<T>`, it's impossible to determine:
1. Whether `StateData` already includes the other branch's traits
2. Whether the additional traits are required for new functionality
3. Which version aligns with the current project's architecture

The conflict is preserved since the intent cannot be unambiguously resolved:

```rust
    /// Each stage that uses `State<T>` for system run criteria needs a driver. If you need to use
    /// your state in more than one stage, consider manually adding [State::get_driver] to the
    /// stages you need it in.
    pub fn add_state_to_stage<T>(&mut self, stage: impl StageLabel, initial: T) -> &mut Self
    where

    {
        self.insert_resource(State::new(initial))
            .add_system_set_to_stage(stage, State::<T>::get_driver())
    }
```
