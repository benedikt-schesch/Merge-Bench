The merge conflict involves changes to both the command line arguments and the expected output of a test case. The HEAD branch includes a specific output with `jinja2==3.1.3`, while the other branch adds a `--exclude-newer` flag to the command and expects `anyio==3.5.0` as output.

Since these are fundamentally different test scenarios:
1. The command arguments differ (`--exclude-newer` exists in one branch but not the other)
2. The expected outputs are completely different packages
3. The comments explaining the command generation differ

This appears to be two separate test cases being added in conflicting ways. Without additional context about which test should take precedence or how they should be combined, the conflict cannot be automatically resolved. Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:
