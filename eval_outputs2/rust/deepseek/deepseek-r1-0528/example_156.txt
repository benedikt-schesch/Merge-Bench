I've analyzed the merge conflict in the provided Rust code snippet. The conflict occurs in the `ToolsStyle::OffsetCamera` branch where two different function calls are proposed. Here's my reasoning:

1. The conflict shows two different argument lists for `draw_on_doc()`:
   - HEAD branch uses `(cx, engine_view)`
   - Other branch uses `(cx, doc_bounds, camera)`

2. Both sides appear to represent valid semantic changes:
   - The HEAD version maintains consistency with the `DragProximity` tool call above
   - The other branch suggests a more specialized call with additional parameters

3. Without additional context about:
   - The function signature of `offsetcamera_tool.draw_on_doc()`
   - Availability of `doc_bounds` and `camera` variables in scope
   - Which change is more recent or intended

I've determined this conflict is ambiguous and should not be automatically resolved. Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```rust
            }
            ToolsStyle::DragProximity => {
                self.dragproximity_tool.draw_on_doc(cx, engine_view)?;
            }
            ToolsStyle::OffsetCamera => {
<<<<<<< HEAD
                self.offsetcamera_tool.draw_on_doc(cx, engine_view)?;
=======
                self.offsetcamera_tool.draw_on_doc(cx, doc_bounds, camera)?;
>>>>>>> b1f235954bda4766a5a241fa40dcbeb19237c8a3
            }
        }

        cx.restore().map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!("{}", e))?;
        Ok(())
```
