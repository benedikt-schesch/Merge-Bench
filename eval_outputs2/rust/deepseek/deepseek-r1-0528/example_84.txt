Based on the context provided, the conflict appears to be about lifetime parameter ordering in `ChildBuilder` and `Commands`. After analyzing both versions:

1. The `push_children` field is identical in both branches
2. The lifetime parameters (`'w`, `'s`, `'a`) are the same in both versions
3. The only difference is the ordering of `'w` and `'s` in:
   - The struct's generic parameters
   - The `Commands` type parameters

Since lifetime parameter ordering doesn't affect functionality in Rust (they're just labels), and both versions are semantically equivalent, I've resolved the conflict by keeping the HEAD version for consistency with the surrounding code. Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
pub struct PushChildren {
    parent: Entity,
    children: SmallVec<[Entity; 8]>,
}

pub struct ChildBuilder<'w, 's, 'a> {
    commands: &'a mut Commands<'w, 's>,
    push_children: PushChildren,
}

impl Command for PushChildren {
    fn write(self, world: &mut World) {
```
