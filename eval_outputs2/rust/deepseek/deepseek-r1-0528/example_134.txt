The merge conflict involves two branches adding different arguments to a function call. The HEAD branch adds `is_already_polyfilled` and `options`, while the other branch adds `&mut is_patch_esm_flag`. Without additional context about the function's signature or the relationship between these arguments, it's impossible to determine the correct resolution. The arguments appear semantically unrelated and might represent incompatible changes to the function's interface.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
>>>>>>> 24a95b48172836d31c55697037d5dada7d9c1ef7
      export,
      bundle_variable,
      module_analyzer_manager,
      polyfill,
<<<<<<< HEAD
      is_already_polyfilled,
      options,
=======
      &mut is_patch_esm_flag
>>>>>>> 24a95b48172836d31c55697037d5dada7d9c1ef7
    )?);
  }

  Ok(patch_export_to_module)
}

```
