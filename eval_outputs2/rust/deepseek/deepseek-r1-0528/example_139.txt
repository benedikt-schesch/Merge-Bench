The conflict arises from both branches modifying the same import statements. The HEAD branch adds `farmfe_core::HashMap` and imports specific items from `common`, while the other branch imports different items from `common`. The resolution combines both sets of imports while preserving the existing structure.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
use farmfe_core::HashMap;
use std::path::PathBuf;

use common::{
  assert_compiler_result_with_config, create_compiler_with_args, try_merge_config_file,
  AssertCompilerResultConfig,
  test_builder,
  TestBuilderOptions,
};

mod common;

fn script_test(file: String, crate_path: String) {
  let file_path_buf = PathBuf::from(file.clone());
```

Key changes:
1. Kept `farmfe_core::HashMap` from HEAD
2. Preserved `std::path::PathBuf` (common to both)
3. Merged `common` imports with:
   - HEAD items on original lines
   - Other branch items added as new lines
4. Maintained HEAD's formatting style with:
   - First 3 items on same line
   - Remaining items one-per-line with trailing commas
5. Preserved all other context including spacing
