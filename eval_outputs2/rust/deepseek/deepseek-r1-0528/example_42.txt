```rust
/// # use bevy_app::prelude::*;
/// # use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
///
/// fn main() {
///    App::new()
///        .add_system(hello_world_system)
///        .run();
/// }
///
/// fn hello_world_system() {
///    println!("hello world");
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
The conflict arises from Bevy API changes between versions. Earlier versions required `.system()` for registration, while newer versions accept bare functions. The resolution keeps the modern syntax (without `.system()`) since:
1. It's cleaner and idiomatic for current Bevy
2. Preserves the core intent of adding the system
3. Both versions are functionally equivalent in newer Bevy
4. The surrounding context shows no legacy API usage

The resolution maintains semantic correctness while adopting the more current pattern.
