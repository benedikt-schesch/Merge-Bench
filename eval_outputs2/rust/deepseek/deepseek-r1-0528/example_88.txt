Based on the provided context, I'll resolve the merge conflict by combining both sets of imports while preserving their semantics. The resolution includes:

1. Keeping the `serde::Deserialize` import from both branches
2. Using the more concise grouped import from `crate::app`
3. Preserving the `bevy_ecs::system::IntoSystem` import from the other branch
4. Maintaining logical import ordering (local crate first, then dependencies)

Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
use crate::app::{App, AppExit};
use bevy_ecs::system::IntoSystem;
use serde::Deserialize;

/// Configuration for automated testing on CI
#[derive(Deserialize)]
pub struct CiTestingConfig {
    /// Number of frames after wich Bevy should exit
```

This resolution:
- Preserves all necessary imports from both branches
- Maintains the semantic grouping of imports
- Keeps the comment and struct definition unchanged
- Uses consistent formatting for crate imports
- Retains the `IntoSystem` import which might be required by surrounding code not shown in the snippet

The conflict is resolved by recognizing that both branches were adding complementary imports rather than conflicting changes.
