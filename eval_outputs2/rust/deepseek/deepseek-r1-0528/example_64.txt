I'll resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intent behind both changes. Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
//! ```
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!    App::new()
//!        .add_system(hello_world_system)
//!        .run();
//! }
//!
//! fn hello_world_system() {
//!    println!("hello world");
```

**Resolution Explanation:**
1. **Intent Analysis:** Both sides are trying to add a system to the Bevy app. The difference is in the syntax for registering the system function.
2. **Semantic Understanding:** 
   - The `.system()` suffix was required in older Bevy versions (pre-0.6)
   - Newer Bevy versions (0.6+) allow direct function references without `.system()`
3. **Conflict Resolution:** 
   - The HEAD version uses modern Bevy syntax
   - The other branch uses legacy syntax
   - Since the modern syntax is simpler and more idiomatic for current Bevy versions, I've kept the HEAD version

The conflict is resolved by using the direct function reference syntax which works in current Bevy versions while maintaining backward compatibility through automatic system conversion.
