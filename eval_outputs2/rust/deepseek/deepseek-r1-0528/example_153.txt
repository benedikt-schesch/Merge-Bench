Based on my semantic analysis, both branches are adding necessary imports. The HEAD branch adds `EngineView` and `EngineViewMut` from `crate::engine`, while the other branch adds `AudioPlayer` from `super`, `Document` from `crate::document`, and `EngineTaskSender` from `crate::engine`. These are all compatible and should be merged together.

Here's the resolved version:

```rust
use super::penbehaviour::{PenBehaviour, PenProgress};
use super::AudioPlayer;
use crate::document::Document;
use crate::engine::{EngineTaskSender, EngineView, EngineViewMut};
use crate::store::StrokeKey;
use crate::{Camera, DrawOnDocBehaviour, WidgetFlags};
use kurbo::Shape;
use p2d::query::PointQuery;
use piet::RenderContext;

```
