I've analyzed the merge conflict and determined that the changes are semantically incompatible. The HEAD version requires a `storages` parameter and calls `init_component`, while the other branch removes `storages` and calls `get_or_insert_id`. Since these represent fundamentally different approaches to component ID management, I can't safely resolve this without knowing which approach is correct for the current codebase.

Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```rust
macro_rules! tuple_impl {
    ($($name: ident),*) => {
        /// SAFE: Component is returned in tuple-order. [Bundle::from_components] and [Bundle::get_components] use tuple-order
        unsafe impl<$($name: Component),*> Bundle for ($($name,)*) {
            #[allow(unused_variables)]
<<<<<<< HEAD
            fn component_ids(components: &mut Components, storages: &mut Storages) -> Vec<ComponentId> {
                vec![$(components.init_component::<$name>(storages)),*]
=======
            fn component_ids(components: &mut Components) -> Vec<ComponentId> {
                vec![$(components.get_or_insert_id::<$name>()),*]
>>>>>>> 65e834ce8d5142f1a01d06c2a9e4e7ef4a1238a9
            }

            #[allow(unused_variables, unused_mut)]
            #[allow(clippy::unused_unit)]
            unsafe fn from_components(mut func: impl FnMut() -> *mut u8) -> Self {
```

Key observations:
1. The method signatures are incompatible (differing parameters)
2. The implementation logic differs significantly
3. The safety implications of these changes aren't clear from context
4. Both changes appear to be complete solutions rather than complementary changes

A human developer should resolve this by:
1. Checking which version matches the current `Bundle` trait definition
2. Verifying component initialization requirements
3. Ensuring storage handling is consistent with other parts of the system
4. Testing the final implementation for correctness
