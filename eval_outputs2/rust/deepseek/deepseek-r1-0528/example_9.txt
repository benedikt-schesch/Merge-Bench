To resolve this merge conflict, I need to analyze both changes while considering the surrounding context. Here's my reasoning:

1. The conflict occurs in a pattern match for `BuiltinScalarFunction::Log`
2. Both versions call `simpl_log` but with different arguments and handling:
   - HEAD version uses `Transformed::yes()` and clones `info` with turbofish syntax
   - Other branch calls `simpl_log` directly without wrapper or clone
3. Looking at the `Power` function below (which has no conflict), we see consistent argument handling
4. The key difference is that HEAD uses `Transformed::yes()` while the other branch doesn't
5. Since `Transformed` appears to be a wrapper type used for expression transformation results, and both sides use the `?` operator, the return types are likely compatible
6. The turbofish clone in HEAD (`<&S>::clone(&info)`) seems unnecessarily verbose compared to the simpler `info` in the other branch
7. Given that `info` is likely a reference type, cloning might not be needed if `simpl_log` can work with the reference directly

The most semantic resolution is to use the simpler version from the other branch since:
- It avoids unnecessary cloning
- Maintains consistency with the `Power` handler below
- Reduces visual complexity while preserving functionality

Here's the resolved version:

```rust

            // log
            Expr::ScalarFunction(ScalarFunction {
                func_def: ScalarFunctionDefinition::BuiltIn(BuiltinScalarFunction::Log),
                args,
            }) => simpl_log(args, info)?,

            // power
            Expr::ScalarFunction(ScalarFunction {
                func_def: ScalarFunctionDefinition::BuiltIn(BuiltinScalarFunction::Power),
                args,

```
