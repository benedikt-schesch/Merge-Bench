I'll resolve this merge conflict by combining the imports from both branches while preserving their semantics. Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
use rnote_compose::penhelpers::PenEvent;

use super::AudioPlayer;
use crate::document::Document;
use crate::engine::{EngineTaskSender, EngineView, EngineViewMut};
use crate::{Camera, DrawOnDocBehaviour, StrokeStore, SurfaceFlags, WidgetFlags};

/// types that are pens and can handle pen events
pub trait PenBehaviour: DrawOnDocBehaviour {
    /// Handles a pen event
    fn handle_event(
```

### Resolution Explanation:
1. **Combined Engine Imports**: Both branches needed items from `crate::engine`. The HEAD branch had `{EngineView, EngineViewMut}` while the other branch had `EngineTaskSender`. I combined these into a single import statement.

2. **Preserved Unique Imports**: 
   - Added `super::AudioPlayer` from the other branch
   - Added `crate::document::Document` from the other branch
   - Added `Camera`, `StrokeStore`, and `SurfaceFlags` from the other branch
   - Retained `WidgetFlags` from the HEAD branch

3. **Deduplicated Common Import**: `DrawOnDocBehaviour` appears in both branches so it's only included once.

This resolution maintains all functionality from both branches while organizing the imports logically. The order is structured as:
1. External crate imports
2. Super-relative imports
3. Current crate imports (with submodules first, then root items)
