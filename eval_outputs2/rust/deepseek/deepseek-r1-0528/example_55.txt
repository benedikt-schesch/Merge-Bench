The merge conflict involves the trait bound for the generic type `T` in the `EventReader` implementation. Both sides agree on the struct name and method implementation, but disagree on whether `T` should be a `Resource` or `Component`. Since these are distinct traits with different semantic meanings in Rust (especially in game engine contexts like Bevy), and without additional context about the intended purpose of `EventReader`, this appears to be a genuine conflict in design intent.

Here's the original code with conflict markers preserved:

```rust
                    .map(map_instance_event_with_id),
            ),
    }
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
impl<'w, 's, T: Resource> EventReader<'w, 's, T> {
=======
impl<'w, 's, T: Component> EventReader<'w, 's, T> {
>>>>>>> 65e834ce8d5142f1a01d06c2a9e4e7ef4a1238a9
    /// Iterates over the events this EventReader has not seen yet. This updates the EventReader's
    /// event counter, which means subsequent event reads will not include events that happened
    /// before now.
    pub fn iter(&mut self) -> impl DoubleEndedIterator<Item = &T> {
        self.iter_with_id().map(|(event, _id)| event)
```

Key observations:
1. Both implementations share identical method signatures and documentation
2. The conflict is purely about the trait bound (`Resource` vs `Component`)
3. These traits imply different semantic purposes:
   - `Resource` suggests singleton global data
   - `Component` suggests entity-associated data
4. Without knowing the project's design decisions, this requires human intervention

Resolution requires either:
1. Choosing one trait bound based on project conventions
2. Creating two separate implementations
3. Introducing a new trait that unifies both contexts
4. Modifying `EventReader` to support both use cases

Since the conflict involves fundamental design intent, I've preserved the original conflict markers for manual resolution.
