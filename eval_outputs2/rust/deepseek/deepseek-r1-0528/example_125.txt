Based on the semantic analysis, I'll resolve this conflict by preserving both changes since they serve different purposes. The `HashMap::default()` and `HashMap::new()` are functionally equivalent in Rust, but the additional hash sets from the other branch appear to be necessary for new functionality.

Here's the resolved version:

```rust

    None
  }

  fn write_cache(&self) {
    let mut packages = HashMap::new();
    let mut pending_remove_modules = HashSet::new();
    let mut maybe_remove_package = HashSet::new();

    for item in self.cached_modules.iter() {
      let module = item.value();

      let package_key =

```

Key reasoning:
1. Both `HashMap::default()` and `HashMap::new()` are identical for standard collections
2. The additional hash sets (`pending_remove_modules`, `maybe_remove_package`) appear to be new state variables needed for cache management logic
3. Preserving both changes maintains the HEAD's initialization while incorporating new functionality from the other branch
4. The identical loop structure suggests the new variables will be used in subsequent logic (not shown in snippet)
