The conflict involves the import of `std::path` types. Both changes modify the same line of imports but have different intentions:

1. **HEAD branch** imports both `Path` and `PathBuf`
2. **Other branch** (7d41e7d) imports only `Path`

Since the surrounding context doesn't show how these imports are used later in the file, we can't determine whether `PathBuf` is actually needed. The intent is ambiguous without seeing the full usage in the codebase. 

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
use std::fmt::{Debug, Display, Formatter};
#[cfg(feature = "pyo3")]
use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};
#[cfg(feature = "pyo3")]
use std::ops::Deref;
<<<<<<< HEAD
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
=======
use std::path::Path;
>>>>>>> 7d41e7d260b0681eea5c310f288ac43f331b4c8d
use std::str::FromStr;

#[cfg(feature = "pyo3")]
use pyo3::{
    create_exception, exceptions::PyNotImplementedError, pyclass, pyclass::CompareOp, pymethods,
```
