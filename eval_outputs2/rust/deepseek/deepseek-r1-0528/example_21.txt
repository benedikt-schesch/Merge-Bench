/// The actual conflicting data for a package.

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Eq, Hash, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Ord, schemars::JsonSchema)]
pub enum ConflictPackage {
    Extra(ExtraName),
    Group(GroupName),
    Project,
}


```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. **Preserved both semantic improvements:**
   - Kept the more accurate documentation from HEAD mentioning "the entire project itself" since the `Project` variant exists
   - Adopted the more specific enum name `ConflictPackage` from the other branch as it better reflects the context ("for a package")
   - Retained `schemars::JsonSchema` derive from HEAD as it provides useful functionality

2. **Combined changes logically:**
   - The documentation should mention all variants (including `Project`)
   - The name `ConflictPackage` better matches the preceding documentation ("for a package")
   - The derive macro doesn't conflict with the naming change

3. **Ambiguity note:** This resolution assumes:
   - The enum name change to `ConflictPackage` was intentional and meaningful
   - The JsonSchema derive should be preserved
   - Both branches agree on the variant structure

If these assumptions don't hold (e.g., if surrounding code relies on `ConflictKind` name), manual adjustment may be needed.
