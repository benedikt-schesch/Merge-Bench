Based on the context, this merge conflict appears to be related to Bevy API changes where explicit `.system()` calls were required in older versions but became optional in newer versions. Since the HEAD version uses the more modern syntax without `.system()`, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping that version:

```rust
    }
}

impl<T: Asset> Plugin for AssetCountDiagnosticsPlugin<T> {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app.add_startup_system(Self::setup_system)
            .add_system(Self::diagnostic_system);
    }
}

impl<T: Asset> AssetCountDiagnosticsPlugin<T> {
    pub fn diagnostic_id() -> DiagnosticId {
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. Both versions are functionally equivalent
2. The HEAD version uses cleaner, more modern Bevy syntax
3. Removing `.system()` is consistent with Bevy's API evolution
4. The surrounding context doesn't suggest any dependency on older Bevy versions
5. The change is purely syntactic with identical runtime behavior

The conflict resolution maintains the original indentation and structure while choosing the more up-to-date syntax.
