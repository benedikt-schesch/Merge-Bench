The merge conflict involves the trait bounds for `T` in the `SystemParamFetch` implementation for `LocalState<T>`. The HEAD branch requires `T: Resource + FromWorld`, while the incoming branch requires `T: Component + FromWorld`. Since these are distinct traits with different semantic meanings in Rust (likely representing different ECS concepts), and there's no indication they should be combined or that one supersedes the other, the conflict is ambiguous. 

Here's the preserved snippet with the conflict:

```rust
    fn default_config() -> Option<T> {
        None
    }
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
impl<'w, 's, T: Resource + FromWorld> SystemParamFetch<'w, 's> for LocalState<T> {
=======
impl<'w, 's, T: Component + FromWorld> SystemParamFetch<'w, 's> for LocalState<T> {
>>>>>>> 65e834ce8d5142f1a01d06c2a9e4e7ef4a1238a9
    type Item = Local<'s, T>;

    #[inline]
    unsafe fn get_param(
        state: &'s mut Self,
``` 

Resolution requires domain-specific knowledge about whether `T` should be a `Resource` (global data) or `Component` (entity-attached data) in this context. Since this can't be determined from the given snippet, the conflict remains unresolved.
