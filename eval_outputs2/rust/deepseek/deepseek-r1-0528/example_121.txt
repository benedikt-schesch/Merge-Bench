```rust
    pub(crate) fn overwrite_typarams(
        ctx: &'c Context,
        qt: &Type,
        st: &Type,
    ) -> EvalResult<Option<Self>> {
        if qt == st {
            return Ok(None);
        }
        let mut qtps = qt.typarams();
        let mut stps = st.typarams();
        if qt.qual_name() == st.qual_name() {
            if st.is_union_type() || st.is_intersection_type() {
                let mut q_indices = vec![];

```

I've resolved the conflict by keeping the early return optimization from the HEAD branch (`if qt == st` check). This maintains the semantic intent of both branches:

1. The optimization is valid - if the types are identical, we can immediately return `Ok(None)` since no type parameter overwriting is needed
2. The subsequent logic from both branches remains intact and will only execute when types are different
3. The optimization doesn't interfere with the type parameter handling logic that follows
4. This preserves efficiency while maintaining correctness

The resolution maintains the original spacing and context exactly as provided, only removing the conflict markers while keeping both branches' meaningful contributions.
