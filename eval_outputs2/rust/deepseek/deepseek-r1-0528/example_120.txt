```rust
    pub(crate) fn substitute_typarams(
        ctx: &'c Context,
        qt: &Type,
        st: &Type,
    ) -> EvalResult<Option<Self>> {
        if qt == st {
            return Ok(None);
        }
        let mut qtps = qt.typarams();
        let mut stps = st.typarams();
        // Or, And are commutative, choose fitting order
        if qt.qual_name() == st.qual_name() {
            if st.is_union_type() || st.is_intersection_type() {
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
- The early return `if qt == st` optimization from HEAD is semantically valid - when types are identical, no substitution is needed
- This optimization doesn't interfere with subsequent commutative type handling logic
- The branch removal (b84bd19) appears to be removing an optimization rather than fixing a bug
- Preserving the optimization improves efficiency without changing behavior
- The resolution maintains compatibility with both branches' logic flows
- No ambiguity in intent - both branches aim for correct substitution, HEAD adds a performance optimization
