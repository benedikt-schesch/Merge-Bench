The conflict arises from changes to the `datafusion::common::tree_node` imports. The HEAD branch uses `Transformed, TreeNode, VisitRecursion` while the other branch uses `TreeNode, TreeNodeRecursion`. 

Based on DataFusion's evolution:
1. `VisitRecursion` was renamed to `TreeNodeRecursion` in later versions
2. `Transformed` is a new type added in HEAD
3. `TreeNode` remains common

The semantic intent is to:
- Keep the new `Transformed` type (HEAD)
- Use the renamed `TreeNodeRecursion` (other branch)
- Keep shared `TreeNode`
