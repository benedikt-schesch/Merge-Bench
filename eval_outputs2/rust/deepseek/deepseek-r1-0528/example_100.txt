The conflict cannot be automatically resolved due to fundamental differences in approach:
1. **Functionality divergence** - HEAD uses a Rust closure (`Box<Fn(&str) + Send>`) while the incoming branch uses a C function pointer (`unsafe extern "C" fn`)
2. **Type incompatibility** - The verbosity parameter differs (`Verbosity` vs `u32`)
3. **Field mismatch** - The struct fields being modified are different (`logger` vs `log`)
4. **Safety differences** - The incoming branch introduces `unsafe` code

The changes represent two different logging implementations that cannot be merged without knowing:
- The struct's field definitions
- Project requirements (FFI vs pure Rust)
- Verbosity handling strategy
- Thread safety requirements

Since the intent is ambiguous and the implementations are mutually exclusive, the conflict is preserved. Manual resolution is required to choose between:
1. Keeping the Rust closure interface
2. Adopting the C-compatible FFI approach
3. Implementing a new solution that accommodates both use cases
