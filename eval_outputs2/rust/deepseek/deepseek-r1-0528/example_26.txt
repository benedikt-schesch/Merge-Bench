I've analyzed the provided merge conflict. The ambiguity arises from differing struct destructuring patterns for `PubGrubDependency` between the two branches. Since I can't verify the current struct definition or the semantic intent behind the field changes, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved as requested.

```rust
            for_version.clone(),
            dependencies.into_iter().map(|dependency| {
                let PubGrubDependency {
                    package,
                    version,
<<<<<<< HEAD
                    parent: _,
                    specifier: _,
=======
>>>>>>> 02345a5a7d7d86c96820e2c1a3d9dbf91d1ec538
                    url: _,
                } = dependency;
                (package, version)
            }),
        );

```
