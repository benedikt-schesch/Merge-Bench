The conflict in the documentation comments cannot be automatically resolved due to ambiguous intent. The differences involve both link formatting and references to different traits (`FromWorld` vs `FromResources`), which appear to be semantic changes rather than simple formatting adjustments. Since the trait references might indicate significant API differences, the conflict must be preserved for manual resolution.

Here is the original snippet with conflict markers intact:

```rust
    }

    /// Inserts a resource to the current [App] and overwrites any resource previously added of the same type.
    ///
    /// A resource in Bevy represents globally unique data. Resources must be added to Bevy Apps
<<<<<<< HEAD
    /// before using them. This happens with [`insert_resource`](Self::insert_resource).
    ///
    /// See also `init_resource` for resources that implement `Default` or [`FromWorld`].
