```rust

  fn run(&self, event_callback: UIEventCallback) -> Result<()> {
    // Make sure the run() method is called in the same thread as initialize()
    if let Some(init_id) = self.init_thread_id.borrow() {
      assert!(
        init_id == &std::thread::current().id(),
        "Win32EventLoop run() and initialize() methods should be called in the same thread"
      );
    }

    let window_handle = self.handle.load(Ordering::Acquire);

```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
Both conflict versions express identical semantics through different logical formulations:
- `init_id == &std::thread::current().id()` (HEAD)
- `!(init_id != &std::thread::current().id())` (incoming)

The positive equality check (`==`) is:
1. More idiomatic Rust
2. Clearer in intent
3. Less cognitively complex  

The assertion message remains unchanged, confirming both branches share the same core requirement: thread affinity between `initialize()` and `run()`. The resolution preserves this intent while choosing the most readable expression.
