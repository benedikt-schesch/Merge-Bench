The merge conflict in the method signature's lifetime parameters cannot be automatically resolved due to ambiguity in the intended order of `'w` and `'s` lifetimes. Both versions are semantically valid but represent different type signatures. Since the correct order depends on external type definitions not visible in this context, the conflict must be preserved for manual resolution.

Here is the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```rust
        let e = self.commands.spawn_bundle(bundle);
        self.push_children.children.push(e.id());
        e
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    pub fn spawn(&mut self) -> EntityCommands<'w, 's, '_> {

    pub fn spawn(&mut self) -> EntityCommands<'s, 'w, '_> {
>>>>>>> 65e834ce8d5142f1a01d06c2a9e4e7ef4a1238a9
        let e = self.commands.spawn();
        self.push_children.children.push(e.id());
        e
    }


```
