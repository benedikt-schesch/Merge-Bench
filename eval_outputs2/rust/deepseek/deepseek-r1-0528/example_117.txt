The conflict arises due to differences in the function signature and body implementation for `__traverse__`. The HEAD branch uses a simpler `Result` type and includes explicit body handling with `$($body)*`, while the other branch uses an absolute path `$crate::_detail::Result` and directly inserts `$body` as the function body. 

Both changes are semantically valid but represent different approaches:
1. **HEAD branch** suppresses unused `$py` variable and expands body tokens
2. **Other branch** uses explicit error type path and expects `$body` to contain full implementation

Since these changes conflict structurally and the exact intent behind each approach is unclear without broader context, the conflict cannot be automatically resolved. The snippet is preserved with conflict markers:

```rust
            $crate::py_coerce_item!{
                impl $class {
                    fn __traverse__(&$slf,
                    $py: $crate::Python,
                    $visit: $crate::py_class::gc::VisitProc)
<<<<<<< HEAD
                    -> Result<(), $crate::py_class::gc::TraverseError> {
                        let _ = $py;
                        $($body)*
                    }

        }
        $members $props
    }};
```
