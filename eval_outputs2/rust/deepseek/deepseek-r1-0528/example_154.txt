The merge conflict involves combining import statements from both branches. The HEAD branch adds `EngineView` and `EngineViewMut` from `crate::engine`, while the other branch adds `AudioPlayer`, `Document`, and `EngineTaskSender`. 

The resolution:
1. Keeps the common `penbehaviour` import
2. Adds `AudioPlayer` from `super`
3. Adds `Document` from `crate::document`
4. Combines engine imports into a single line with all three items
5. Maintains all other existing imports

Resolved code:
```rust
use super::penbehaviour::{PenBehaviour, PenProgress};
use super::AudioPlayer;
use crate::document::Document;
use crate::engine::{EngineView, EngineViewMut, EngineTaskSender};
use crate::strokes::ShapeStroke;
use crate::strokes::Stroke;
use crate::{DrawOnDocBehaviour, WidgetFlags};

use p2d::bounding_volume::AABB;
```
