The merge conflict arises because the trait bound for `T` differs between the branches. Based on the semantic meaning of `OptionResMutState` and `ResMut` (which typically accesses resources in Bevy), the `Resource` bound is more appropriate than `Component`. Here's the resolved snippet:

```rust
    }

    fn default_config() {}
}

impl<'w, 's, T: Resource> SystemParamFetch<'w, 's> for OptionResMutState<T> {
    type Item = Option<ResMut<'w, T>>;

    #[inline]
    unsafe fn get_param(
        state: &'s mut Self,
```

Reasoning:
1. `OptionResMutState` suggests it deals with optional resource access
2. `ResMut<'w, T>` is specifically for resources
3. The `Resource` trait bound maintains consistency with Bevy's ECS conventions
4. Using `Component` here would be semantically incorrect since components are accessed via `Query` not `ResMut`

The context remains unchanged as requested, with only the conflict markers removed and the correct trait bound preserved.
