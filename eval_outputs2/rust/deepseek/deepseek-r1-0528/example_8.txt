The conflict arises from both branches modifying imports from `datafusion_common`. The HEAD branch adds a specific import for `Transformed` and `TransformedResult`, while the other branch introduces a grouped import that includes `TreeNode` and `TreeNodeRewriter`. The semantic intent is to combine both sets of imports into a single grouped import statement for clarity and efficiency.

Here's the resolved code:
```rust
use arrow::{
    array::{new_null_array, AsArray},
    datatypes::{DataType, Field, Schema},
    record_batch::RecordBatch,
};
use datafusion_common::{
    cast::{as_large_list_array, as_list_array},
    tree_node::{TreeNode, TreeNodeRewriter, Transformed, TransformedResult},
};
use datafusion_common::{

```

Key changes made:
1. Removed the conflict markers
2. Merged the standalone import from HEAD (`Transformed, TransformedResult`) into the grouped import
3. Preserved the original structure and spacing of the grouped import
4. Maintained the incomplete trailing import as-is since it's outside the conflict scope

This resolution:
- Avoids duplicate imports of `datafusion_common::tree_node`
- Combines all required items from both branches
- Maintains Rust's idiomatic grouped import style
- Preserves all surrounding context exactly as provided
