Based on the provided code snippet, I'll resolve the merge conflict while preserving the surrounding context and spacing. The conflict involves two different conditions for the `if` statement:

1. The HEAD version checks two static type properties: `Q::Fetch::IS_DENSE && F::Fetch::IS_DENSE`
2. The branch version uses a precomputed field: `self.is_dense`

The resolution should choose the branch version (`self.is_dense`) because:
- It's more efficient (avoids repeated static checks)
- The field likely represents the same condition computed once
- The field name suggests it was introduced to optimize this exact check

Resolved code:
```rust
        &mut self,
        tables: &'w Tables,
        archetypes: &'w Archetypes,
        query_state: &'s QueryState<Q, F>,
    ) -> Option<<Q::Fetch as Fetch<'w, 's>>::Item> {
        if self.is_dense {
            loop {
                if self.current_index == self.current_len {
                    let table_id = self.table_id_iter.next()?;
                    let table = &tables[*table_id];
                    self.fetch.set_table(&query_state.fetch_state, table);
```

The conflict is resolved by keeping the branch version's condition (`self.is_dense`) while maintaining all surrounding context exactly as provided, including spacing and indentation.
