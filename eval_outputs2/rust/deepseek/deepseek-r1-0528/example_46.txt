Based on the function name `insert_resource` and the implementation calling `self.world.insert_resource`, the intent is clearly to insert a **resource**, not a component. The conflicting change to `T: Component` appears to be incorrect since components are typically associated with entities, not global resources.

Resolved version:
```rust
    /// App::new()
    ///    .insert_resource(MyCounter { counter: 0 });
    /// ```
    pub fn insert_resource<T>(&mut self, resource: T) -> &mut Self
    where
        T: Resource,
    {
        self.world.insert_resource(resource);
        self
    }
```

Reasoning:
1. The function name `insert_resource` clearly indicates resource semantics
2. The method call `self.world.insert_resource` expects a resource
3. The example shows a singleton resource (`MyCounter`)
4. `Resource` and `Component` are distinct traits in Rust ECS frameworks like Bevy
