The conflict arises from differing MMIO region sizes for UART and VIRTIO devices. The standard configuration uses 0x1000 page sizes for both devices, which aligns with typical QEMU virt machine mappings. The HEAD version's larger sizes (0xa000/0x9000) are non-standard and the commented VIRTIO line would break the block device functionality. 

Resolved version maintains standard sizes and active VIRTIO mapping required by `BlockDeviceImpl`:

```rust
pub const CLOCK_FREQ: usize = 12500000;

pub const MMIO: &[(usize, usize)] = &[
    (0x1000_0000, 0x1000),    // VIRT_UART0 in virt machine
    (0x1000_1000, 0x1000),    // VIRT_VIRTIO in virt machine
    (0x0C00_0000, 0x40_0000), // VIRT_PLIC in virt machine
    (0x0010_0000, 0x00_2000), // VIRT_TEST/RTC  in virt machine
];

pub type BlockDeviceImpl = crate::drivers::block::VirtIOBlock;
```
