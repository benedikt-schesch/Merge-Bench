I'll resolve this merge conflict by combining the semantic intent of both branches. The conflict is about the documentation for the `shortcut_keys` field in the `PenEvent::Down` variant. 

Analysis:
1. The field type `Vec<ShortcutKey>` indicates it stores pressed keys, not just a boolean
2. HEAD mentions "pressed shortcut keys" (correct) but references "proximity event" (incorrect)
3. Other branch references "down event" (correct) but implies a boolean check (incorrect)

Resolution:
```rust
pub enum PenEvent {
    /// A pen down event. Is repeatedly emitted while the pen is pressed and moved
    Down {
        /// The element for the down event
        element: Element,
        /// The shortcut keys pressed during the down event
        shortcut_keys: Vec<ShortcutKey>,
    },
    /// A pen up event.
    Up {
        /// The element for the down event
```

Changes made:
1. Kept "pressed shortcut keys" from HEAD (accurate for `Vec`)
2. Changed "proximity event" â†’ "down event" from other branch (correct context)
3. Removed "whether" (incorrect for vector type)
4. Combined into one clear comment: "The shortcut keys pressed during the down event"
