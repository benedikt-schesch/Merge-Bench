Based on the surrounding context, particularly the `SystemParam` implementation requiring `T: Resource`, the conflict should be resolved by retaining the `Resource` trait bound. This maintains consistency with the existing implementation while preserving semantics.

Resolved code:
```rust
        self.0
    }
}

/// The [`SystemParamState`] of [`Local<T>`].
pub struct LocalState<T: Resource>(T);

impl<'a, T: Resource + FromWorld> SystemParam for Local<'a, T> {
    type Fetch = LocalState<T>;
}

```

Key reasoning:
1. The `SystemParam` implementation explicitly requires `T: Resource`
2. Changing to `Component` would create a trait bound mismatch
3. Both changes can't coexist as they're mutually exclusive
4. The HEAD version maintains consistency with downstream usage
5. Resource trait is semantically correct for system-local storage

The resolution preserves the original behavior while avoiding compilation errors from conflicting trait requirements.
