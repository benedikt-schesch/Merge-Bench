The conflict arises from differing trait bounds for the `hook` parameter. The resolution requires adding the `Send` trait bound to ensure thread safety when used in multi-threaded environments, while maintaining all other functionality. Here's the resolved version:

```rust
    ///
    /// Hook functions will be called just before volo's own gracefull existing code starts,
    /// in reverse order of registration.
    pub fn register_shutdown_hook(
        mut self,
        hook: impl FnOnce() -> BoxFuture<'static, ()> + 'static + Send,
    ) -> Self {
        self.shutdown_hooks.push(Box::new(hook));
        self
    }
```

Key resolution points:
1. The `Send` trait bound (from the branch commit) is necessary for thread safety
2. Maintains the existing `'static` lifetime requirement
3. Preserves all functionality and context unchanged
4. Ensures compatibility with multi-threaded async runtimes

This resolution satisfies both versions' requirements by:
- Allowing hooks to be safely sent between threads (`Send`)
- Maintaining ownership requirements (`'static`)
- Keeping identical function behavior and context
