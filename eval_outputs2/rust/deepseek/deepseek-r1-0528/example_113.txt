Based on the semantic analysis of both changes:

1. The common attributes at the top should be preserved
2. The `allow(non_snake_case)` attribute from the other branch should be kept (with its TODO comment)
3. The module declaration and exports from HEAD are essential functionality
4. The README documentation from the other branch is valuable and should be included
5. Both changes are compatible and can be merged sequentially

Here's the resolved version:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_auto_cfg))]
#![warn(clippy::print_stderr)]
#![warn(clippy::print_stdout)]
#![allow(non_snake_case)] // TODO: Delete me

mod dict_codegen;

pub use crate::dict_codegen::*;

#[doc = include_str!("../README.md")]
#[cfg(doctest)]
pub struct ReadmeDoctests;
