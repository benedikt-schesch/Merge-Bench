I've analyzed the provided merge conflict. The conflict involves two significant changes that are semantically incompatible without additional context:

1. **Variable name difference**: One branch uses `pipeline` while the other uses `plan`
2. **Result handling difference**: One branch accesses `.data` field while the other stores the entire transformed plan

Since I can't determine:
- Which variable name (`pipeline` vs `plan`) is correct in this context
- Whether the `.data` field access is still valid/needed
- The exact types and structures involved
- How subsequent code uses either `state` or `new_plan`

I'm returning the original conflicted snippet as requested, as the intent is ambiguous without broader context.
