The conflict arises from two changes:
1. The incoming branch adds a crate-level attribute `#![allow(clippy::needless_update)]` above the imports
2. The incoming branch also adds a `collections::HashMap` import to the `std` block
3. The HEAD branch doesn't have these changes

The resolution combines both changes:
1. Keep the crate-level attribute since it's a new addition that doesn't conflict
2. Add `collections::HashMap` to the imports since it doesn't conflict with existing ones
3. Preserve all existing imports from both branches

Resolved code:
```rust
#![allow(clippy::needless_update)]

use std::{
  collections::HashMap,
  fs,
  path::{Path, PathBuf},
  sync::Arc,
};
```
