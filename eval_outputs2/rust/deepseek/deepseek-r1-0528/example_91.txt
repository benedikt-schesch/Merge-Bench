The merge conflict involves differences in imports and documentation between the two branches. The HEAD branch includes module documentation, additional imports (`Storages` and `Resource`), and a re-export of `Component`, while the other branch simplifies the imports to only include `SparseSetIndex`. 

Since there's ambiguity about whether the additional items in HEAD are still needed (they might have been intentionally removed in the other branch), and the documentation/re-export might be semantically important, I'm returning the unresolved conflict for manual resolution.

```rust
<<<<<<< HEAD
//! Types for declaring and storing [`Component`]s.

use crate::{
    storage::{SparseSetIndex, Storages},
    system::Resource,
};
pub use bevy_ecs_macros::Component;
=======
use crate::storage::SparseSetIndex;

use std::{
    alloc::Layout,
    any::{Any, TypeId},
};
use thiserror::Error;

```
