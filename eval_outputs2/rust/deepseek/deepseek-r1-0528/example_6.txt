The conflict involves two changes to the `update_current_playback_state` method that can't be automatically merged due to conflicting semantics:

1. **Async vs Sync** - The HEAD branch converted the method to async and added `.await` to `get_current_playback()`, while the other branch kept it synchronous
2. **Timestamp Type** - HEAD uses `Instant::now()` while the other branch uses `SystemTime::now()`

Since these changes represent conflicting approaches to concurrency and time handling, and we don't have broader context about:
- How `get_current_playback()` is defined in the merged codebase
- How this method is called elsewhere
- The intended use of `playback_last_updated`

I must leave the conflict unresolved. Here's the exact output:

```rust
            None => Err(anyhow!("failed to get the current playback context")),
        }
    }

    /// updates the current playback state by fetching data from the spotify client
<<<<<<< HEAD
    async fn update_current_playback_state(&self, state: &state::SharedState) -> Result<()> {
        state.player.write().unwrap().playback = self.get_current_playback().await?;
        state.player.write().unwrap().playback_last_updated = Some(std::time::Instant::now());
