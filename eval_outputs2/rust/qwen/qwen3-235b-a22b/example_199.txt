No reasoning found</think>
The merge conflict centers around the addition of a single import statement `use log::trace;`. This change originated from a different branch, which inserted the import below `use common::http::Client;`.

To reason through this, we consider the nature of import statements in Rust. Their presence is often dictated by the actual usage of the imported identifiers (e.g., `trace!` macro in this case). However, **this snippet does not show usage of `trace!`**, nor does it offer insight into whether such a usage is expected to have been added elsewhere in the file that is not included here.

Since the `HEAD` branch has no addition in this area while the incoming change insists on the presence of the `use log::trace;` line, it is unclear whether the semantic intent behind adding the import is valid in the combined context. Thus, the intent appears **ambiguous** based solely on the provided code snippet.

As per your instruction â€” if the intent is ambiguous, the resolution should **preserve the conflict as-is** without modification.

Here is the original snippet with conflict preserved:

```rust
use crate::metrics::Metrics;
use crate::stream_context::StreamContext;
use common::configuration::{Configuration, Overrides, PromptGuards, PromptTarget, Tracing};
use common::http::Client;
