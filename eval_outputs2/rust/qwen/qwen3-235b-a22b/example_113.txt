The merge conflict arises from two potentially complementary changes to `lib.rs`—one focusing on internal code structure (via `mod` declarations), and the other on documentation and testing setup, including a crate-level lint override.

---

### Merge Intent Analysis:

- **From `HEAD`:**
  - Creates the `dict_codegen` module.
  - Re-exports all contents of `dict_codegen` to allow external crates to access auto-generated dictionaries.

- **From `271edc6`:**
  - Adds a testing scaffold for verifying the README.md contents (`ReadmeDoctests`).
  - A temporary `#![allow(non_snake_case)]` attribute is added—possibly due to the struct name `ReadmeDoctests` not conforming to Rust style guide expectations.

---

### Semantic Resolution:

These changes appear to serve **independent, non-overlapping concerns**:
- One builds out core functionality.
- The other ensures documentation correctness and testing.

Thus, **both sets of changes should coexist**, maintaining the original order of their introduction in their respective branches. Since lint attributes are valid anywhere at the top of a crate (unless scoped), placing the `#[allow(non_snake_case)]` before the struct declaration suffices to suppress the lint for the struct's name.
