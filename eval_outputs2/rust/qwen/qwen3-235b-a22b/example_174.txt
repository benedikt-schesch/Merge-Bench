The primary task of the given `match` expression is to convert variants of the `Source` enum into associated constants like `TERNARY`, `INDEXING`, and so on.

In the context of the conflict:

- One branch (HEAD) introduces a new arm: `Source::Random => RANDOM,`
- Another branch introduces a different arm: `Source::Quantized => QUANTIZED,`

These are not conflicting changes to the same `Source` variant. Instead, they both seem to be extending the `match` block with two distinct `Source` types.

Therefore, **semantically**, both additions are valid and likely intended by the code authors. Since there is no logical conflict in which one superseded the other, the correct resolution is to **include both arms**, preserving their order as in the original merge conflict.

Here is the **full code snippet with resolved merge conflict**:

```rust
            Source::Ternary => TERNARY,
            Source::Indexing => INDEXING,
            Source::Cast => CAST,
            Source::Reduce => REDUCE,
            Source::Conv => CONV,
            Source::Random => RANDOM,
            Source::Quantized => QUANTIZED,
            Source::Mfa => panic!("Invalid lib"),
        }
    }

    /// Load the give library from its [`source`].
```
