The provided code snippet contains a **merge conflict** between two commits, primarily related to the presence of the `parent: None,` and `specifier: None,` fields in a struct initialization.

This disagreement suggests a potential evolution in the structure of the data:
- The `HEAD` branch includes `parent` and `specifier` as `None`, implying these fields are valid and expected by the current struct definition.
- The branch associated with commit `02345a5a7d7d...` omits these lines, possibly indicating they were removed from the struct or no longer needed.

---

Since we **do not have access to the struct definition**, we cannot determine definitively whether `parent` and `specifier` are still valid struct members or whether omitting them is correct or harmful in context. The struct could potentially implement `Default`, allowing fields to be omitted, or the fields may have been deprecated and removed entirely in a later version of the codebase.

Given this **ambiguity in the intent** of one or both sides of the merge, and the need to ensure semantic correctness and compilation safety, the **safe and proper resolution** is to **preserve the original conflict markers** as defined in the instructions and leave the conflict unresolved for a developer who understands the larger context to resolve it.
