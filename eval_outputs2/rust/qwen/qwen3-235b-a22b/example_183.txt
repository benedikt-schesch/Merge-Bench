The code appears to be attempting to fetch data asynchronously with proper error handling, including network errors (`Http::fetch_text` failures) and JSON parsing errors.

Both sides of the conflict compute the same result (`Msg::ReceivedData`, `Msg::JsonError`, or `Msg::RequestError`). The only difference is that one wraps the result in a variable `let msg = ...` while the other directly uses the match expression. Semantically, both versions are functionally equivalent at this point in the code, assuming the branch using `msg` later returns it (as is standard for Rust expressions). Since the code following the conflict is not visible, the intent behind `let msg =` is unclear.

If this variable was introduced to allow for additional processing (e.g., logging, assertions, or state changes), resolving to that version would preserve the possibility of such future logic. Otherwise, the version without the variable is also valid. However, because the intent behind `let msg =` is not evident, the appropriate and safe resolution under the conditions specified is to **preserve the conflict as ambiguous**.

```rust
    }

    fn fetch_page(&self) -> Cmd<Msg> {
        let url = format!("{}?page={}&per_page={}", DATA_URL, self.page, PER_PAGE);
        Cmd::new(async move {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            match Http::fetch_text(&url).await {
=======
            let msg = match Http::fetch_text(&url).await {
>>>>>>> 4673a4d76c7c700966297bc9131217215d922db9
                Ok(v) => match serde_json::from_str(&v) {
                    Ok(data1) => Msg::ReceivedData(data1),
                    Err(err) => Msg::JsonError(err),
                },
                Err(e) => Msg::RequestError(e),
```
