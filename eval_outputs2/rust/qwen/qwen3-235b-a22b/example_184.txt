To resolve this semantic merge conflict, it's important to examine what each side is attempting to express **logically** within the closure.

---

### ✅ Analysis of the Conflict

We are inside a function capturing a closure body:

```rust
|msg| {
    ...
}
```

Inside that closure, there is logic which:

1. Attempts to process some `v` as a JSON string.
2. If `Ok(v)`:
   - Parses the JSON.
   - Returns either decoded data or a JSON error.
3. If `Err(e)`:
   - Returns a request-level error.

So logically, the closure **returns** a `Msg` derived from parsing — which is the expected behavior for something like this in Rust:

```rust
move |msg| match ... {
    Ok(...) => Msg,
    Err(...) => Msg,
}
```

---

### 🔍 HEAD Version (✔️ Correct Intention)

```rust
            }
```

This closes the outer `match`, which correctly returns the value of the match arms (all of which resolve to `Msg` variants). Thus, the closure as a whole returns a `Msg`.

---

### 🔍 Incoming Branch (❌ Problematic)

```rust
            };
            msg
```

This closes the match with a semicolon, which **discards** the result of the match expression. Then, it returns `msg` directly. The name `msg` here refers to the parameter of the closure, not the result of any processing.

This change changes semantics – instead of returning the decoded/parsed `Msg`, it returns the original — possibly unprocessed — `msg`. That seems to defeat the entire purpose of the processing logic above.

---

### ✅ Resolution Outcome

Because the HEAD version maintains correct semantics (the match construct resolves to a `Msg` and is the return value), **we preserve it** in the resolution.

The incoming change appears to either be a mistake, or made under incorrect assumptions (such as adding further processing logic not visible in the snippet). Since we cannot assume future logic and given the visible code, the HEAD version is the one with the correct logical outcome.

### 💾 Final Resolved Snippet

```rust
                Ok(v) => match serde_json::from_str(&v) {
                    Ok(data1) => Msg::ReceivedData(data1),
                    Err(err) => Msg::JsonError(err),
                },
                Err(e) => Msg::RequestError(e),
            }
        })
    }
}
