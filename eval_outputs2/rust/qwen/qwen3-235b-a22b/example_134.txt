The provided merge conflict between the two branches introduces ambiguity regarding the intended function signature and parameter list. Specifically:

- The `HEAD` branch includes the lines:
  ```rust
      is_already_polyfilled,
      options,
  ```
- The remote branch, identified by `24a95b48172836d31c55697037d5dada7d9c1ef7`, replaces those two lines with:
  ```rust
      &mut is_patch_esm_flag,
  ```

This represents a clear semantic conflict: are we passing **two parameters** (`is_already_polyfilled`, `options`), or **one new parameter** (`&mut is_patch_esm_flag`)? Without knowing how the called function is defined (i.e., how many and which parameters it expects), it's impossible to determine which change is correct—or whether both changes should be incorporated differently.

---

### Why this can't be resolved safely:
- Removing both `is_already_polyfilled` and `options` in favor of `&mut is_patch_esm_flag` assumes the function signature has changed, which may not align with the `HEAD` branch's intent.
- Keeping both lines in the `HEAD` ignores the addition from the other branch, possibly missing a valid update.
- Merging both (e.g., keeping all three) may be syntactically invalid if the function does not accept three arguments.

Thus, the safest and most principled behavior—especially as a tool or expert without full semantic knowledge of the code's intent—is to **preserve the conflict markers** and return the snippet unchanged.
