To resolve this conflict, we need to carefully consider the intent and semantics of both branches. The function `set_window_icon` appears in both versions with the exact same parameter:

```rust
windows: NonSend<WinitWindows>
```

This suggests that both sides of the conflict agree on the need to wrap `WinitWindows` in `NonSend`, likely because `WinitWindows` is not thread-safe, and Bevy's scheduling system requires `NonSend` to handle non-Send types correctly.

However, the divergence lies in the **comment** that was added by the incoming branch (`74bcda6655dbdbd805cab696e3c9a3d3df697f49`). This line:

```rust
// we have to use `NonSend` here
```

is missing from the `HEAD` version but provides a helpful explanation of *why* the type is wrapped in `NonSend`. This is a documentation improvement rather than a behavioral change.

### Resolution

Since both branches agree on the function signature and only one branch adds the explanatory comment, **the semantically meaningful resolution is to keep both branchesâ€™ changes**:
- Keep the `NonSend<WinitWindows>` parameter (agreed upon by both),
- Include the comment that clarifies the need for `NonSend`, preserving developer intent and improving readability.

### Final Merged Snippet

```rust
use bevy::window::WindowId;
use bevy::winit::WinitWindows;
use winit::window::Icon;

fn set_window_icon(
    // we have to use `NonSend` here
    windows: NonSend<WinitWindows>,
) {
    let primary = windows.get_window(WindowId::primary()).unwrap();

    // here we use the `image` crate to load our icon data from a png file
```
