I cannot resolve this conflict confidently based on semantic intent alone, as there are two distinct changes in conflicting regions that could affect both error handling semantics (`Result` vs `$crate::_detail::Result`) and macro body expansion (`$(body)*` vs `$body`).

Returning the unmodified snippet with the conflict markers preserved as requested:

```rust
            $crate::py_coerce_item!{
                impl $class {
                    fn __traverse__(&$slf,
                    $py: $crate::Python,
                    $visit: $crate::py_class::gc::VisitProc)
<<<<<<< HEAD
                    -> Result<(), $crate::py_class::gc::TraverseError> {
                        let _ = $py;
                        $($body)*
                    }
=======
                    -> $crate::_detail::Result<(), $crate::py_class::gc::TraverseError>
                    $body
>>>>>>> f2fa212f7ae068505676a86e36b38a4af977bd77
                }
            }
        }
        $members $props
    }};

```
