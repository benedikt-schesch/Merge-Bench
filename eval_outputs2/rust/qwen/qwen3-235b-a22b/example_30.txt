The merge conflict arises from differing assumptions about the structure of the `PubGrubPackage::Package` enum variant. On one side of the merge (HEAD), the code assumes a 4-field variant with `_extra` and `_source` fields being ignored, while the other branch (fab8d858b636fce9e841e0228a9ebd6b3ddcbe04) assumes a 3-field variant with explicit checks for two `None` values.

Since the correct structure of this variant is not evident from the snippet and depends on unprovided context—such as the enum definition and each branch’s version of it—resolving this conflict accurately would require knowledge of that structure and the intended logic for pattern matching.

Given this ambiguity, the correct action is to preserve the conflict markers and return the snippet unchanged, as instructed when the intent is unclear.

```rust
        request_sink: &tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender<Request>,
    ) -> Result<(), ResolveError> {
        // Iterate over the potential packages, and fetch file metadata for any of them. These
        // represent our current best guesses for the versions that we _might_ select.
        for (package, range) in packages {
