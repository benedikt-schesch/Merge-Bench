The provided merge conflict arises from differing imports of the `component` module, where `ComponentStorage` is included in one branch (HEAD) but excluded in another.  The context, while providing some clues (e.g., usage of `ArchetypeComponentId`), does not definitively establish whether `ComponentStorage` is *required* by the current codebase.  The presence of `ComponentStorage` alongside `StorageType` suggests a possible interdependency. However, the removal of `ComponentStorage` in one branch could indicate a refactor where it's no longer needed, moved to a different module, or its functionality was merged into `StorageType`.

The lack of the actual implementation details that utilize these imported items makes it impossible to conclusively determine the correct resolution from a semantic and functional standpoint.  The decision hinges on external context not available within the provided snippet.

Therefore, in line with the instructions, the snippet is returned with the conflict left unresolved:

```rust
use crate::{
    archetype::{Archetype, ArchetypeComponentId},
<<<<<<< HEAD
    component::{Component, ComponentId, ComponentStorage, ComponentTicks, StorageType},
=======
    component::{Component, ComponentId, ComponentTicks, StorageType},
>>>>>>> 65e834ce8d5142f1a01d06c2a9e4e7ef4a1238a9
    entity::Entity,
    query::{Access, Fetch, FetchState, FilteredAccess, WorldQuery},
    storage::{ComponentSparseSet, Table, Tables},
    world::World,
};
```
