    /// Bevy plugins can be grouped into a set of plugins. Bevy provides
    /// built-in PluginGroups that provide core engine functionality.
    ///
    /// The plugin groups available by default are `DefaultPlugins` and `MinimalPlugins`.

    /// ## Example
    /// ```
    /// # use bevy_app::{prelude::*, PluginGroupBuilder};
