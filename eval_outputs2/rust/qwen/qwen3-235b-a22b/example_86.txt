The merge conflict arises from differing lifetime parameter orders in the return type of the `spawn` method. Both versions of the code aim to return an `EntityCommands` object with lifetimes tied to the same underlying context (`'w` and `'s`), but the order of the lifetimes differs. Without further context on how the `'w` and `'s` lifetimes are defined within the struct or module (e.g., which represents the world, system, or another scope), neither version can be semantically determined as definitively correct over the other.

Since the intent behind the lifetime ordering is ambiguous and could impact borrow-checking validity depending on the broader codebase, the safest and most accurate resolution is to preserve the conflict as-is.

```rust
        let e = self.commands.spawn_bundle(bundle);
        self.push_children.children.push(e.id());
        e
    }
