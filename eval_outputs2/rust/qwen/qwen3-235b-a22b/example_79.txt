```rust
    vsync: bool,
    resizable: bool,
    decorations: bool,
    cursor_visible: bool,
    cursor_locked: bool,
    physical_cursor_position: Option<DVec2>,
    cursor_position: Option<Vec2>,
    raw_window_handle: RawWindowHandleWrapper,
    focused: bool,
    mode: WindowMode,
    #[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
    pub canvas: Option<String>,
    command_queue: Vec<WindowCommand>,
```

**Resolution rationale:**  
1. `physical_cursor_position` (HEAD) and `cursor_position` (other branch) serve complementary roles:
   - `DVec2` (double-precision) for physical coordinates (high-precision device input)
   - `Vec2` (single-precision) for logical coordinates (typically used in UI logic)
2. `raw_window_handle` is orthogonal to cursor positioning and was added in the other branch without any semantic conflict
3. All three fields appear to be non-overlapping in functionality and can coexist without ambiguity
