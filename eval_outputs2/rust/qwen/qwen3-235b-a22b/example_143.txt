The merge conflict centers around the line `pub mod window;`, where one branch preserves it as active and public, whereas the other branch has commented it out, likely temporarily disabling the module. 

From a semantic standpoint:

- Keeping `pub mod window;` indicates the `window` module is intended as part of the visible and public API of the crate or parent module.
- Commenting out `// pub mod window;` suggests either an intent to disable the module temporarily or an alternative development path that has opted not to expose or compile this module at this time.

There is no additional context given about the motivations of each branch or other affected areas, which would be needed to resolve confidently based on intent. Since the core behavior and visibility of the `window` module is in question and no guiding rationale is provided to prioritize one change over the other, the resolution remains ambiguous.

Therefore, the correct resolution — as per the instruction — is to return the code snippet exactly as provided, with the unresolved merge conflict intact.
