This is a simple refactoring merge conflict where both sides have the same code, but the order of the generic lifetime parameters has been changed. In Rust, the order of generic parameters is a convention, and the change from `'w, 's, 'a` to `'s, 'w, 'a` was likely done to improve consistency across the codebase. We will resolve this by accepting the reordered version, as it represents the intended refactoring.

```rust
            }
        }
    }
}

impl<'s, 'w, 'a> ChildBuilder<'s, 'w, 'a> {
    pub fn spawn_bundle(&mut self, bundle: impl Bundle) -> EntityCommands<'s, 'w, '_> {
        let e = self.commands.spawn_bundle(bundle);
        self.push_children.children.push(e.id());
        e
    }
