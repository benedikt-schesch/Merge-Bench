An analysis of the conflict reveals two different generic constraints for the type `T` in the `EventWriter` struct.

- The `HEAD` version constrains `T` with `T: Resource`.
- The `65e834ce...` version constrains `T` with `T: Component`.

In Entity-Component-System (ECS) frameworks like Bevy, events are managed via a resource of type `Events<T>`. For the `Events<T>` collection to be a valid resource, the event type `T` must also satisfy the requirements of a `Resource`. Therefore, the `T: Resource` constraint is fundamental to the correct functioning of the event system.

The `T: Component` constraint is more restrictive. While a type can be both a `Component` and a `Resource`, not all events are necessarily components. Components are data attached to specific entities, whereas events are typically global, transient messages. Enforcing that all event types must also be components would be an overly strong requirement for a generic `EventWriter` and would conflate two distinct concepts in the ECS paradigm.

The most semantically correct resolution is to use the `T: Resource` constraint, as it aligns with the core design of an event system built on top of resources. This change was likely part of a broader refactor to correctly type the event system.

```rust
    events: Res<'w, Events<T>>,
}

/// Sends events of type `T`.
#[derive(SystemParam)]
pub struct EventWriter<'w, 's, T: Resource> {
    events: ResMut<'w, Events<T>>,
    #[system_param(ignore)]
    marker: PhantomData<&'s usize>,
}
