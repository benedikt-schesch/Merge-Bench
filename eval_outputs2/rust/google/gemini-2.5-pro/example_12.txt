As a semantic merge conflict resolution expert, my goal is to understand the intent behind the conflicting changes and merge them in a way that preserves both, if possible, or chooses the most logical path forward if they are contradictory.

### Analysis of the Conflict

1.  **`HEAD` Branch Intent:** This side attempts to add a new logical step. It transforms a plan, extracts the resulting data (`.map(|t| t.data)`), and then passes it to a `check_integrity` function. However, the implementation has several issues:
    *   It uses a variable `pipeline` which is not defined; the function argument is `plan`.
    *   It assigns the result to a variable named `state`, but the subsequent code requires a variable named `new_plan`.
    *   This logic effectively discards the transformed plan, which is needed for the rest of the function.

2.  **`e1ca74e7c68e4949504e902f91d2e2b152cfc910` Branch Intent:** This side appears to be refactoring or simplifying the code. It correctly uses the input `plan` and assigns the result to `new_plan`, which is what the code following the conflict expects. However, its handling of the `transform_up` result is likely incorrect. `transform_up` typically returns a `Result<Transformed<T>>`, and this code uses `?` which would yield a `Transformed<T>`, not the plan `T` itself. It seems to be missing a step to extract the actual plan data.

### Resolution Strategy

The intent of the `e1ca74e7...` branch (to transform `plan` into `new_plan`) is more aligned with the surrounding code's requirements. The `HEAD` branch's attempt to add an integrity check is fundamentally broken as written and was likely removed or moved during the refactoring that `e1ca74e7...` represents. The `TODO` comment `// TODO: End state payloads will be checked here.` further suggests that any checking logic is intended to be handled later.

The most logical resolution is to adopt the intent of the `e1ca74e7...` branch but correct its implementation. The standard pattern for this operation in DataFusion is to unwrap the `Result` and then access the `.data` field of the `Transformed` struct. This combines the correct variable naming from one branch with a corrected, functional implementation.

### Resolved Code

```rust
    pub(crate) fn crosscheck_plans(plan: Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>) -> Result<()> {
        let subrules: Vec<Box<PipelineFixerSubrule>> = vec![
            Box::new(hash_join_convert_symmetric_subrule),
            Box::new(hash_join_swap_subrule),
        ];
        let new_plan =
            plan.transform_up(&|p| apply_subrules(p, &subrules, &ConfigOptions::new()))?
                .data;
        // TODO: End state payloads will be checked here.
        let config = ConfigOptions::new().optimizer;
        let collect_left_threshold = config.hash_join_single_partition_threshold;
        let collect_threshold_num_rows = config.hash_join_single_partition_threshold_rows;
        let _ = new_plan.transform_up(&|plan| {
