Resolving this merge conflict requires combining the arguments added from both branches into the function call. The `HEAD` branch adds `is_already_polyfilled` and `options`, while the other branch adds `&mut is_patch_esm_flag`. These appear to be independent features added to the function's capabilities. The semantic intent is most likely to have all three new arguments present in the final function call.

```rust
      export,
      bundle_variable,
      module_analyzer_manager,
      polyfill,
      is_already_polyfilled,
      options,
      &mut is_patch_esm_flag
    )?);
  }

  Ok(patch_export_to_module)
}
