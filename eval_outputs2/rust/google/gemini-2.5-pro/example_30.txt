Resolving this conflict requires understanding the change in the `PubGrubPackage::Package` struct.

1.  **The `fab8d858b636fce9e841e0228a9ebd6b3ddcbe04` side:**
    `let PubGrubPackage::Package(package_name, None, None) = package else { ... }`
    This line handles a 3-element tuple struct. It only proceeds if the second and third elements are `None`, meaning it will skip packages that have an `extra` or are `dev` packages.

2.  **The `HEAD` side:**
    `let PubGrubPackage::Package(package_name, _extra, None, _source) = package else { ... }`
    This line handles a 4-element tuple struct, indicating that the struct definition for `PubGrubPackage::Package` has been updated to include a fourth element, `_source`. It also changes the condition on the second element from `None` to `_extra`, meaning it now processes packages even if they have an `extra`, but still skips `dev` packages (the third element must be `None`).

**Resolution:**
The `HEAD` version reflects a more recent and expanded definition of the `PubGrubPackage::Package` struct, which now includes a `_source`. The change from `None` to `_extra` is also intentional; it broadens the prefetching logic to include packages with extras. The prefetch request uses only the `package_name`, so it makes sense to fetch the base package metadata regardless of any specific extra.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the `HEAD` version, as it contains the updated struct definition and more comprehensive logic.

```rust
        request_sink: &tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender<Request>,
    ) -> Result<(), ResolveError> {
        // Iterate over the potential packages, and fetch file metadata for any of them. These
        // represent our current best guesses for the versions that we _might_ select.
        for (package, range) in packages {
            let PubGrubPackage::Package(package_name, _extra, None, _source) = package else {
                continue;
            };
            request_sink
                .send(Request::Prefetch(package_name.clone(), range.clone()))
                .await?;

```
