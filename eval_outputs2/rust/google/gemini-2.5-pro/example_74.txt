I have analyzed the merge conflict. The two sides of the conflict define the generic trait bound for `T` in `LocalState<T>` differently. One side requires `T: Resource`, while the other requires `T: Component`.

By examining the surrounding code, specifically the `SystemParam` implementation for `Local<'a, T>`, we can determine the correct intent. The implementation is `impl<'a, T: Resource + FromWorld> SystemParam for Local<'a, T>`. This implementation constrains `T` to be a `Resource`. For the associated type `type Fetch = LocalState<T>;` to be valid within this implementation, the `T` passed to `LocalState` must satisfy `LocalState`'s own trait bounds.

Therefore, `LocalState` must require `T: Resource` to be consistent with the `SystemParam` implementation. The change to `T: Component` would cause a compilation error as the implementation only guarantees that `T` is a `Resource`, not a `Component`.

Based on this semantic analysis, the correct resolution is to use the version that requires `T: Resource`.

```rust
        self.0
    }
}

/// The [`SystemParamState`] of [`Local<T>`].
pub struct LocalState<T: Resource>(T);

impl<'a, T: Resource + FromWorld> SystemParam for Local<'a, T> {
    type Fetch = LocalState<T>;
}
