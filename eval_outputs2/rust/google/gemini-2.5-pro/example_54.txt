An expert in semantic merge conflict resolution would recognize that the two branches are attempting to change the trait bound on the event type `T`.

*   **HEAD** (`T: Resource`): This side's intent is to constrain event types to be `Resource`s. In an ECS context like Bevy, a `Resource` is typically a global, singleton data structure. This is semantically odd for an event type, as you usually have many instances of an event, not one global instance. The collection of events, `Events<T>`, is the resource, but the event `T` itself is usually not.
*   **Branch** (`T: Component`): This side's intent is to constrain event types to be `Component`s. In many ECS frameworks, `Component` is the trait for data that can be attached to entities. While events are not typically attached to entities, `Component` was in some versions of Bevy a more general-purpose trait for plain-old-data that the ECS `World` is aware of.

**Resolution:**

Comparing the two intents, making an event type a `Component` is a more plausible design choice than making it a `Resource`. Events are individual pieces of data, much like components, whereas resources are singletons. The change to `T: Component` was part of a larger, known refactor in the Bevy engine's history to unify data types under a common trait. Therefore, the `Component` trait bound is the more semantically correct resolution.

```rust
    events: ResMut<'w, Events<T>>,
    #[system_param(ignore)]
    marker: PhantomData<&'s usize>,
}

impl<'w, 's, T: Component> EventWriter<'w, 's, T> {
    pub fn send(&mut self, event: T) {
        self.events.send(event);
    }

    pub fn send_batch(&mut self, events: impl Iterator<Item = T>) {
