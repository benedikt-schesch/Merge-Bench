As a semantic merge conflict resolution expert, I will analyze the intent of both sides of the conflict and merge them.

*   **HEAD**: This change introduces two arguments to the function call. The first is `Some(format!("{}/{}/", scope, package_name))`, which appears to be a documentation path prefix. The second is `None`, likely a placeholder for a new argument that this branch is aware of but doesn't have a value for.
*   **e6e89b04147f8ce611e5ffb5b142225e081e7caa**: This change introduces a single argument, `package.readme_source`, which passes the source of the package's README file.

**Analysis of Intent:** It appears both branches are adding new, distinct features to the function being called. One branch adds support for a custom documentation path prefix, while the other adds support for specifying a README source. The `None` value in `HEAD` strongly suggests it was updated to a function signature that now accepts the `readme_source` argument, but this specific call site didn't provide it.

The most logical resolution is to combine both contributions. The `docs_path_prefix` argument from `HEAD` should be kept, and the `None` placeholder should be replaced with the `package.readme_source` argument from the other branch. This integrates both new functionalities.

```rust
    version_or_latest == VersionOrLatest::Latest,
    repo,
    None,
    package.runtime_compat,
    registry_url,
    Some(format!("{}/{}/", scope, package_name)),
    package.readme_source,
  )
  .map_err(|e| {
    error!("failed to generate docs: {}", e);
    ApiError::InternalServerError
  })?
