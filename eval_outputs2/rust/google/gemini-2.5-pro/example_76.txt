The conflict arises from two different sets of `use` statements being added at the beginning of a test module.

The `HEAD` branch adds a more comprehensive set of testing utilities:
-   An alias for the crate root (`use crate as bevy_ecs;`), a common pattern in crate-internal tests.
-   The `Component` trait and a generic test `Component` struct `W<T>`, which are typical for testing component-related functionality.
-   An import for `Storages`.

The other branch adds a smaller, subset of imports which are also present in `HEAD`.

The most logical semantic resolution is to combine these changes by keeping the `HEAD` version, as it is a superset that includes all necessary imports from both branches. This ensures that any tests relying on the more comprehensive setup from the `HEAD` branch will not break.

The second conflict marker `<<<<<<< HEAD` at the end of the snippet appears to be incomplete and is likely a copy-paste artifact. It has been removed as part of the resolution.

```rust
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate as bevy_ecs;
    use crate::component::Component;
    use crate::storage::Storages;
    use crate::{component::Components, entity::Entity, storage::Table};
    #[derive(Component)]
    struct W<T>(T);

    #[test]
    fn table() {
        let mut components = Components::default();
