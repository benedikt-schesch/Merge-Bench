The conflict arises from a likely dependency upgrade of the `tokio` crate.

-   The `HEAD` branch includes `use tokio::prelude::Future;` and `use tokio::runtime::TaskExecutor;`. These are imports from an older version of `tokio` (v0.1).
-   The other branch removes these imports.
-   The context already includes `use std::future::Future;`, which is the standard library's `Future` trait used by modern `tokio` versions (v0.2 and later).

The most probable intent is to upgrade `tokio` and use the standard library's `Future`, making the old `tokio` imports obsolete. Therefore, the correct resolution is to remove the conflicting lines.

```rust
use glfw::Context;
use parking_lot::Mutex;
use std::ffi::c_void;
use std::future::Future;
use std::sync::Arc;

pub(crate) struct GlfwFlutterEngineHandler {
    pub(crate) glfw: glfw::Glfw,
    pub(crate) window: Arc<Mutex<glfw::Window>>,
    pub(crate) resource_window: Arc<Mutex<glfw::Window>>,
