The conflict arises from two different ways of returning a value from a closure in Rust.

- The `HEAD` version uses the more idiomatic Rust approach where the last expression in a block (the `match` statement) is implicitly returned.
- The other version (`4673a4d...`) seems to be part of a refactor to explicitly assign the result of the `match` to a variable `msg` and then return `msg`. However, the `let msg =` part is missing from the conflict, making this side syntactically incorrect as-is.

Both branches intend to return the `Msg` produced by the `match` statement from the closure. The `HEAD` version achieves this cleanly and idiomatically. We will resolve the conflict by choosing the `HEAD` version.

```rust
                Ok(v) => match serde_json::from_str(&v) {
                    Ok(data1) => Msg::ReceivedData(data1),
                    Err(err) => Msg::JsonError(err),
                },
                Err(e) => Msg::RequestError(e),
            }
        })
    }
}
