Resolving this merge conflict requires understanding the semantic intent of both branches.

- **HEAD:** This branch introduces a new boolean parameter `should_reexport_raw`. It passes the original `source` variable as the next argument.
- **Branch `24a95b48172836d31c55697037d5dada7d9c1ef7`:** This branch refactors how the `source` is passed. Instead of passing it directly, it calls `source.to_module_id()` to convert it to a `ModuleId`. This implies a structural refactoring in the codebase.

The most logical resolution is to combine both intents: the new feature flag from `HEAD` and the structural refactoring from the other branch. This assumes the function signature was updated to accept both the new boolean and the refactored `ModuleId` type.

The resolved code combines these changes.

```rust

  for source in ordered_external_export {
    let export = &bundle_reference.external_export_map[source];

    patch_export_to_module.extend(generate_export_as_module_export(
      should_reexport_raw,
      Some(&source.to_module_id()),
      export,
      bundle_variable,
      module_analyzer_manager,
      polyfill,
