The conflict arises from a refactoring of how file system entries are handled and a formatting change. The `HEAD` branch uses a custom `DirEntry` and `ReadDir` from within `gleam_core`, while the other branch replaces this with the `DirEntry` from the popular `ignore` crate, which is specialized for this task. The second branch also formats the `use` statements according to Rust conventions.

The semantic intent of the second branch is to replace the custom implementation with a standard, robust library (`ignore`). This is a clear improvement. The `HEAD` branch's `DirEntry` and `ReadDir` are now superseded. The commented-out `flate2` import appears to be a remnant of a previous implementation attempt and can be safely removed.

The resolution is to adopt the changes from the second branch, which uses `ignore::DirEntry` and has cleaner formatting.

```rust
use gleam_core::{
    error::{Error, FileIoAction, FileKind},
    io::{
        CommandExecutor, FileSystemIO, FileSystemWriter, OutputFile, WrappedReader, WrappedWriter,
    },
    Result,
};
use ignore::DirEntry;
use lazy_static::lazy_static;
use std::{
    ffi::OsStr,
    fmt::Debug,
    fs::File,

```
