Resolving this conflict requires understanding the semantic intent of both branches.

*   **HEAD branch intent**: The `Client` is constructed with a `session` and a `spotify` object, and it uses an asynchronous `reqwest` client.
*   **Incoming branch (`d291d45...`) intent**: This branch appears to be a significant refactoring. It switches the authentication mechanism from a `session` object to an `oauth` object, creates a default `Spotify` instance instead of taking one as an argument, and, most importantly, switches from an asynchronous `reqwest` client to a `reqwest::blocking` client. This suggests a move to a synchronous API.

A direct combination of both versions is not possible as they represent two different architectural approaches (asynchronous vs. synchronous) and different authentication methods. The incoming branch's changes are incompatible with the existing function signature `new(session: Session, spotify: Spotify)` because it introduces an `oauth` parameter and removes the `session` and `spotify` parameters.

However, a valid semantic merge can be achieved by combining the intents. The most coherent resolution is to adopt the switch to a blocking client from the incoming branch while retaining the existing API signature and authentication method from HEAD. This assumes the desire is to change the internal HTTP handling to be blocking, without yet changing the public-facing API for client creation. This produces valid, compilable code that incorporates a key change from the incoming branch.

```rust

impl Client {
    /// creates the new `Client` given a spotify authorization
    pub fn new(session: Session, spotify: Spotify) -> Self {
        Self {
            session,
            spotify,
            http: reqwest::blocking::Client::new(),
        }
    }

    /// handles a client event
    pub fn handle_event(
