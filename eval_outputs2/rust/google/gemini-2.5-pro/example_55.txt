Resolving this merge conflict requires understanding the evolution of the Bevy Engine's event system.

*   **The `HEAD` side:** `impl<'w, 's, T: Resource> EventReader<'w, 's, T>` treats events as `Resource` types. This was the design in older versions of Bevy.
*   **The incoming side:** `impl<'w, 's, T: Component> EventReader<'w, 's, T>` treats events as `Component` types. This is part of a larger architectural shift in Bevy to unify concepts and allow events to be attached to specific entities.

Keeping both `impl` blocks would lead to a "conflicting implementation" error from the Rust compiler if a type implemented both `Resource` and `Component`. The clear semantic intent is to migrate the event system from being resource-based to component-based. Therefore, the incoming change, which uses the `Component` trait bound, should be adopted as it reflects the more modern and intended architecture.

```rust
                    .map(map_instance_event_with_id),
            ),
    }
}

impl<'w, 's, T: Component> EventReader<'w, 's, T> {
    /// Iterates over the events this EventReader has not seen yet. This updates the EventReader's
    /// event counter, which means subsequent event reads will not include events that happened
    /// before now.
    pub fn iter(&mut self) -> impl DoubleEndedIterator<Item = &T> {
        self.iter_with_id().map(|(event, _id)| event)
```
