Resolving this conflict requires combining the intents of both branches.

-   The `HEAD` branch introduces a new module `dict_codegen` and makes its contents public.
-   The other branch adds a crate-level attribute to allow `non_snake_case` linting (as a temporary measure) and adds a standard Rust pattern to include the `README.md` file for documentation and doctests.

Both of these changes are semantically independent and can be merged. The standard convention is to place all crate-level attributes (`#![...]`) at the top of the file, followed by module declarations and other items.

The resolved code combines the crate-level attributes from both branches, then includes the module declaration from `HEAD`, and finally adds the documentation testing structure from the other branch.

```rust
#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_auto_cfg))]
#![warn(clippy::print_stderr)]
#![warn(clippy::print_stdout)]
#![allow(non_snake_case)] // TODO: Delete me

mod dict_codegen;

pub use crate::dict_codegen::*;

#[doc = include_str!("../README.md")]
#[cfg(doctest)]
pub struct ReadmeDoctests;

```
