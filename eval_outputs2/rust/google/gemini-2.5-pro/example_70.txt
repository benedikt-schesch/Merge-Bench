This conflict is about the trait bound for a generic type `T` on an implementation of `SystemParamFetch` for a type named `ResState<T>`.

*   The `HEAD` branch constrains `T` with `T: Resource`.
*   The other branch constrains `T` with `T: Component`.

Given the names `ResState` and the associated item type `Res<'w, T>`, the intent is almost certainly to work with "Resources". In ECS patterns like the one used in Bevy (which this code resembles), `Res` is the system parameter to access a shared resource. Therefore, the correct trait bound for `T` should be `Resource`. The `Component` trait bound is likely a mistake, as components are typically associated with entities, not global resources.

The resolution is to use the `T: Resource` trait bound from the `HEAD` branch.

```rust
    }

    fn default_config() {}
}

impl<'w, 's, T: Resource> SystemParamFetch<'w, 's> for ResState<T> {
    type Item = Res<'w, T>;

    #[inline]
    unsafe fn get_param(
        state: &'s mut Self,
