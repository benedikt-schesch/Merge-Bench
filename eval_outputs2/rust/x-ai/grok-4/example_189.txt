```rust
/// In addition to `lhs <- rhs;` performing the monadic bind, there
/// is `lhs !<- rhs;` which is equivalent to `lhs <- no_backtracking(rhs);`.
/// The final expression given is wrapped in an `Ok((input, expr, location))`
///
/// for example:
/// ```txt
/// parser!(basic_definition loc =
///     name <- variable;
///     _ <- expect(Token::Equal);
///     value !<- expression;
///     Expr::definition(name, value, loc, ())
