```rust

  fn run(&self, event_callback: UIEventCallback) -> Result<()> {
    // Make sure the run() method is called in the same thread as initialize()
    if let Some(init_id) = self.init_thread_id.borrow() {
      assert!(
        init_id == &std::thread::current().id(),
        "Win32EventLoop run() and initialize() methods should be called in the same thread"
      );
    }

    let window_handle = self.handle.load(Ordering::Acquire);
