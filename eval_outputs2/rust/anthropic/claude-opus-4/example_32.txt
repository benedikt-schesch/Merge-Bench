Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the `PubGrubPackage::Package` variant, but with different signatures:

- HEAD has: `PubGrubPackage::Package(package_name, _extra, Some(url), _source)`
- The incoming change has: `PubGrubPackage::Package(package_name, _extra, Some(url))`

The key differences are:
1. The incoming change adds a new `PubGrubPackage::Extra` variant
2. HEAD includes a `_source` parameter in the `Package` variant that the incoming change doesn't have

Both sides want to handle the case where there's a URL (`Some(url)`), and HEAD also has a second match arm for when there's no URL (`None`).

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to report progress with a URL when available
- HEAD wants to handle both URL and non-URL cases with the additional `_source` parameter
- The incoming change wants to add handling for the `Extra` variant

Here's the resolved conflict that preserves both intents:

```rust
    fn on_progress(&self, package: &PubGrubPackage, version: &Version) {
        if let Some(reporter) = self.reporter.as_ref() {
            match package {
                PubGrubPackage::Root(_) => {}
                PubGrubPackage::Python(_) => {}
                PubGrubPackage::Extra(_, _, _) => {}
                PubGrubPackage::Package(package_name, _extra, Some(url), _source) => {
                    reporter.on_progress(package_name, &VersionOrUrl::Url(url));
                }
                PubGrubPackage::Package(package_name, _extra, None, _source) => {
                    reporter.on_progress(package_name, &VersionOrUrl::Version(version));
                }

```
