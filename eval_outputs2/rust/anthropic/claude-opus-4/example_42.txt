Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Uses `.add_system(hello_world_system)` - a more direct, simpler syntax
- **Incoming change**: Uses `.add_system(hello_world_system.system())` - explicitly calling `.system()` method

This appears to be a common pattern in Bevy (a Rust game engine) where the API evolved over time. The `.system()` method was required in older versions of Bevy but became unnecessary in newer versions as the API was simplified to automatically convert functions into systems.

Given that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal (adding a system to the App), and the HEAD version represents the more modern, cleaner API, I'll resolve in favor of HEAD:

```rust
/// # use bevy_app::prelude::*;
/// # use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
///
/// fn main() {
///    App::new()
///        .add_system(hello_world_system)
///        .run();
/// }
///
/// fn hello_world_system() {
///    println!("hello world");
```
