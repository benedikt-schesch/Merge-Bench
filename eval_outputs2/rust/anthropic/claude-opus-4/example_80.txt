Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to initialize fields in what appears to be a window-related struct. The conflict shows:

- HEAD wants to add `physical_cursor_position: None,`
- The other branch wants to add `cursor_position: None,` and `raw_window_handle: RawWindowHandleWrapper::new(raw_window_handle),`

Based on the semantic intent:
1. Both sides want to track cursor position, but with slightly different field names (`physical_cursor_position` vs `cursor_position`)
2. The incoming branch also adds a `raw_window_handle` field which seems to be an additional feature

The most likely resolution is to include both the cursor position field (using the more specific `physical_cursor_position` name from HEAD) and the `raw_window_handle` from the incoming branch, as they serve different purposes.

```rust
            vsync: window_descriptor.vsync,
            resizable: window_descriptor.resizable,
            decorations: window_descriptor.decorations,
            cursor_visible: window_descriptor.cursor_visible,
            cursor_locked: window_descriptor.cursor_locked,
            physical_cursor_position: None,
            raw_window_handle: RawWindowHandleWrapper::new(raw_window_handle),
            focused: true,
            mode: window_descriptor.mode,
            #[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
            canvas: window_descriptor.canvas.clone(),
            command_queue: Vec::new(),
```
