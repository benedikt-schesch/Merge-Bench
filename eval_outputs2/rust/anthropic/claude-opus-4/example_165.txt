Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add fields to the `WasmiModule` struct, but with different approaches:

- The HEAD side is adding `host_exports` (with a lifetime parameter `'a`) and a `ctx` of type `MappingContext`
- The other side is adding a `ctx` of type `EventHandlerContext` and a `valid_module` field

Both sides want a `ctx` field but with different types (`MappingContext` vs `EventHandlerContext`). Without more context about the broader refactoring goals, I cannot determine which context type should be used or if both are needed.

Since the intent is ambiguous and would require understanding the broader architectural changes being made, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
/// A WASM module based on wasmi that powers a subgraph runtime.
pub(crate) struct WasmiModule<T, L, S, U> {
    pub logger: Logger,
    pub module: ModuleRef,
    memory: MemoryRef,
<<<<<<< HEAD
    host_exports: &'a HostExports<T, L, S, U>,
    ctx: MappingContext,
=======
    pub ctx: EventHandlerContext,
    pub valid_module: Arc<ValidModule<T, L, S, U>>,
>>>>>>> f9b24f804955b0c5983d2c16d3dd293354f7b59c

    // Time when the current handler began processing.
    start_time: Instant,

    // True if `run_start` has not yet been called on the module.
```
