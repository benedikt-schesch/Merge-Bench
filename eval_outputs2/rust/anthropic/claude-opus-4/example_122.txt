Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - ensuring that the `run()` method is called in the same thread as `initialize()`. 

The HEAD version uses a direct equality check:
```rust
init_id == &std::thread::current().id()
```

The incoming change uses a double negative:
```rust
!(init_id != &std::thread::current().id())
```

Both expressions are logically equivalent, but the HEAD version is clearer and more idiomatic. The double negative in the incoming change is unnecessarily complex.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust

  fn run(&self, event_callback: UIEventCallback) -> Result<()> {
    // Make sure the run() method is called in the same thread as initialize()
    if let Some(init_id) = self.init_thread_id.borrow() {
      assert!(
        init_id == &std::thread::current().id(),
        "Win32EventLoop run() and initialize() methods should be called in the same thread"
      );
    }

    let window_handle = self.handle.load(Ordering::Acquire);

```
