Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD version has an empty implementation for the `RefreshToken` event (just returning `false`)
2. The incoming change adds token refresh logic that checks if the token has expired and refreshes it if needed
3. Below the conflict, there's commented-out code that appears to be an async version of similar logic

The semantic intent seems to be adding token refresh functionality. The incoming change implements this synchronously while the commented code suggests there might have been plans for an async implementation.

Since the incoming change provides the actual implementation while HEAD is empty, and the commented code below suggests this functionality was intended, I'll resolve by accepting the incoming change:

```rust
            event::Event::GetCurrentPlayback => {
                self.update_current_playback_state(state)?;
                false
            }
            event::Event::RefreshToken => {
                let expires_at = state.player.read().unwrap().auth_token_expires_at;
                if SystemTime::now() > expires_at {
                    state.player.write().unwrap().auth_token_expires_at = self.refresh_token()?;
                }
                false
                // let expires_at = state.player.read().unwrap().auth_token_expires_at;
                // if SystemTime::now() > expires_at {
                //     state.player.write().unwrap().auth_token_expires_at =
                //         self.refresh_token().await?;

```
