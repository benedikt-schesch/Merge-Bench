Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import constants from the same module. The conflict appears to be in the list of imported constants.

The HEAD branch has:
- `TRACE_PARENT_HEADER, USER_ROLE,`

The incoming branch (c7c0553427d4e00b0254838d1a7fc0e9567645a4) has:
- `TRACE_PARENT_HEADER, USER_ROLE, X_ARCH_API_RESPONSE, X_ARCH_FC_MODEL_RESPONSE,`
- `X_ARCH_STATE_HEADER, X_ARCH_TOOL_CALL,`

The semantic intent appears to be that the incoming branch is adding new constants (`X_ARCH_API_RESPONSE`, `X_ARCH_FC_MODEL_RESPONSE`, `X_ARCH_STATE_HEADER`, `X_ARCH_TOOL_CALL`) while keeping all the existing ones. Both sides agree on having `TRACE_PARENT_HEADER` and `USER_ROLE`.

The resolution should include all constants from both sides:

```rust
    },
    consts::{
        ARCH_FC_MODEL_NAME, ARCH_INTERNAL_CLUSTER_NAME, ARCH_ROUTING_HEADER,
        ARCH_UPSTREAM_HOST_HEADER, ASSISTANT_ROLE, CHAT_COMPLETIONS_PATH, HEALTHZ_PATH,
        MODEL_SERVER_NAME, MODEL_SERVER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS, REQUEST_ID_HEADER, TOOL_ROLE,
        TRACE_PARENT_HEADER, USER_ROLE, X_ARCH_API_RESPONSE, X_ARCH_FC_MODEL_RESPONSE,
        X_ARCH_STATE_HEADER, X_ARCH_TOOL_CALL,
    },
    errors::ServerError,
    http::{CallArgs, Client},
    pii::obfuscate_auth_header,
};

```
