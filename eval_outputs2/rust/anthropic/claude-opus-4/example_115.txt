Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that HEAD is trying to add two new public module declarations (`array_buffer` and `array_buffer_view`), while the other branch has these lines removed or never added them.

Without more context about the intent of both branches, I cannot definitively determine whether these modules should be included or not. The conflict represents a fundamental disagreement about whether these array buffer modules should be part of the public API.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
mod string;
mod support;
mod try_catch;
mod value;

<<<<<<< HEAD

// This module is intentionally named "V8" rather than "v8" to match the
