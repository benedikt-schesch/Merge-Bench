Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version has a `path` field in the `Requirement` struct that was removed in the other branch (7d41e7d260b0681eea5c310f288ac43f331b4c8d).

Without more context about the intent behind these changes, I cannot determine whether the `path` field should be kept or removed. The conflict appears to be a structural change where one branch added/kept a field while another removed it.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
        let Requirement {
            name,
            extras,
            version_or_url,
            marker,
<<<<<<< HEAD
            path,
=======
>>>>>>> 7d41e7d260b0681eea5c310f288ac43f331b4c8d
        } = self;
        Requirement {
            name,
            extras,
            version_or_url: match version_or_url {
```
