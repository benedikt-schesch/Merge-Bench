Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add new module declarations to what appears to be a module listing file. The HEAD branch wants to add `pub(crate) mod random;` while the other branch wants to add `pub(crate) mod where_cond;`. 

Since these are just module declarations and there's no semantic conflict between having both modules, the resolution should include both additions to preserve the intent of both branches.

```rust
pub(crate) mod affine;
pub(crate) mod matmul;
pub(crate) mod random;
pub(crate) mod where_cond;

use candle_core::{Device, Result};

pub(crate) trait BenchDevice {
    fn sync(&self) -> Result<()>;

```
