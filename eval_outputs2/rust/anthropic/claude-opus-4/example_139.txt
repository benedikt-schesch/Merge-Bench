Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD branch is using a more complex testing setup with `HashMap`, `assert_compiler_result_with_config`, `create_compiler_with_args`, `try_merge_config_file`, and `AssertCompilerResultConfig`
2. The incoming branch (24a95b4) is using a simpler testing approach with `test_builder` and `TestBuilderOptions`

Since both sides are trying to set up testing infrastructure but with different approaches, and without more context about which testing framework should be used, I cannot determine the correct resolution. The intent is ambiguous as both appear to be valid testing setups.

Here is the same snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
<<<<<<< HEAD
use farmfe_core::HashMap;
use std::path::PathBuf;

use common::{
  assert_compiler_result_with_config, create_compiler_with_args, try_merge_config_file,
  AssertCompilerResultConfig,
};
=======
use std::path::PathBuf;

use common::{test_builder, TestBuilderOptions};
>>>>>>> 24a95b48172836d31c55697037d5dada7d9c1ef7

mod common;

fn script_test(file: String, crate_path: String) {
  let file_path_buf = PathBuf::from(file.clone());

```
