Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - initializing a thread-local `TIME_SPENT` variable. The only difference is formatting:

- HEAD version: `const {RefCell::new(vec![])}`
- Other version: `const { RefCell::new(vec![]) }` (with spaces inside the braces)

Since this is purely a formatting difference with no semantic change, I'll resolve by choosing the version with spaces inside the braces, as this tends to be more common in Rust formatting conventions.

```rust
        }
    }
}

#[cfg(feature = "with-debug")]
thread_local!(pub static TIME_SPENT: RefCell<Vec<Section>> = const { RefCell::new(vec![]) });

#[cfg(feature = "with-debug")]
pub fn add_time_trace(section: Section) {
    TIME_SPENT.with_borrow_mut(|v| {
        v.push(section);

```
