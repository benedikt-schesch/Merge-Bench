Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import items from `datafusion::common::tree_node`, but with different sets of types:

- HEAD wants: `Transformed`, `TreeNode`, `VisitRecursion`
- The other branch wants: `TreeNode`, `TreeNodeRecursion`

Both sides agree on importing `TreeNode`, but differ on the other imports. This appears to be a case where the API has changed between versions - `VisitRecursion` seems to have been renamed to `TreeNodeRecursion`, and `Transformed` is only needed in HEAD.

Since both sides need their respective imports to work with their code, the semantic resolution is to include all the imports that either side needs:

```rust

use datafusion::common::tree_node::{Transformed, TreeNode, TreeNodeRecursion, VisitRecursion};
use datafusion::datasource::listing::{ListingTable, ListingTableUrl};
use datafusion::datasource::source_as_provider;
use datafusion::error::DataFusionError;
use std::any::type_name;
use std::collections::HashMap;
```
