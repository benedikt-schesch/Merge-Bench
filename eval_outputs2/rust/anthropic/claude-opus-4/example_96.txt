Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different imports to the `use` statements section. The HEAD branch is adding imports for hooks and file removal functionality, while the other branch is adding an import for interactive prompting functionality. These appear to be complementary features rather than conflicting ones.

Since both sets of imports seem to serve different purposes and don't conflict with each other semantically, the resolution should include both sets of imports.

```rust

use anyhow::{anyhow, bail, Context, Result};
use config::{locate_template_configs, Config, CONFIG_FILE_NAME};
use console::style;
use favorites::{list_favorites, resolve_favorite_args_and_default_values};
use hooks::{execute_post_hooks, execute_pre_hooks};
use ignore_me::remove_dir_files;
use interactive::prompt_for_variable;
use liquid::ValueView;
use project_variables::{StringEntry, TemplateSlots, VarInfo};
use std::{
    borrow::Borrow,
    collections::HashMap,
