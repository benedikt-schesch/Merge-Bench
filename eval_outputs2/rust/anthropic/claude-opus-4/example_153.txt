Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different imports to the same file. The HEAD branch is importing `EngineView` and `EngineViewMut`, while the other branch is importing `AudioPlayer`, `Document`, and `EngineTaskSender`.

Since both sets of imports appear to be needed (they're importing different items from different modules), the semantic intent is to include all of these imports. The conflict arose simply because both branches added imports at the same location.

Here's the resolved version:

```rust
use super::penbehaviour::{PenBehaviour, PenProgress};
use super::AudioPlayer;
use crate::document::Document;
use crate::engine::{EngineView, EngineViewMut, EngineTaskSender};
use crate::store::StrokeKey;
use crate::{Camera, DrawOnDocBehaviour, WidgetFlags};
use kurbo::Shape;
use p2d::query::PointQuery;
use piet::RenderContext;

```
