Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import different modules. The HEAD branch is importing `EngineView`, `EngineViewMut`, and `WidgetFlags`, while the other branch is importing `Document`, `EngineTaskSender`, `Camera`, `StrokeStore`, `SurfaceFlags`, and `AudioPlayer`.

Both sides share `DrawOnDocBehaviour` in common, and both appear to be setting up imports needed for the `PenBehaviour` trait below. Without more context about which imports are actually needed by the code that follows, the safest resolution is to include all imports from both sides:

```rust
use rnote_compose::penhelpers::PenEvent;

use crate::document::Document;
use crate::engine::{EngineTaskSender, EngineView, EngineViewMut};
use crate::{Camera, DrawOnDocBehaviour, StrokeStore, SurfaceFlags, WidgetFlags};

use super::AudioPlayer;

/// types that are pens and can handle pen events
pub trait PenBehaviour: DrawOnDocBehaviour {
    /// Handles a pen event
    fn handle_event(

```
