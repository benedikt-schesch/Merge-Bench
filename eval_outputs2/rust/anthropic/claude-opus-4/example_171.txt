Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is adding configuration for a `missing_format` and creating a `widget`, while the other branch appears to have removed or not included these lines.

Based on the semantic intent:
- The HEAD branch seems to be adding functionality to handle cases where backlight devices are missing (with a `missing_format` configuration)
- The creation of the `widget` appears to be part of the same feature addition
- The other branch either removed these or represents an earlier state without this functionality

Since the HEAD branch is adding useful functionality (handling missing backlight devices) that doesn't conflict with the surrounding code, I'll resolve by keeping the HEAD changes:

```rust
        (MouseButton::WheelDown, None, "brightness_down"),
    ])
    .await?;

    let format = config.format.with_default(" $icon $brightness ")?;
    let missing_format = config
        .missing_format
        .with_default(" no backlight devices ")?;
    let mut widget = Widget::new();

    let mut cycle = config
        .cycle
        .unwrap_or_else(|| vec![config.minimum, config.maximum])
        .into_iter()

```
