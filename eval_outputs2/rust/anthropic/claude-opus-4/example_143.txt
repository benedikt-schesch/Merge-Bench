Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD (current branch) has `pub mod window;` uncommented
- The incoming branch (2cc67a0957b29b57e65c0234c31703b3868e29f7) has `//pub mod window;` commented out

Since I cannot determine the intent behind why one side wants the module active while the other wants it commented out, I should preserve the conflict as is. This requires a human decision about whether the window module should be included or not in the codebase.

```rust
pub mod platform;
pub mod prelude;
pub mod settings;
pub mod system;
pub mod textinput;
<<<<<<< HEAD
pub mod window;
=======
//pub mod window;
>>>>>>> 2cc67a0957b29b57e65c0234c31703b3868e29f7
