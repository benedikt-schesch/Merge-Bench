Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the conflict is between:
- HEAD: No debug statement
- Incoming change: Adding a debug statement `debug!("End of get process name.");`

Based on the context, this appears to be at the end of a function that gets a process name. The incoming change is simply adding a debug log statement before the return statement. This is a non-conflicting semantic change - one side made no changes while the other added debugging information.

The appropriate resolution is to accept the incoming change since it adds useful debugging information without affecting the logic:

```rust
            .filter(|x| !x.is_empty() && x.first().unwrap().process.pid == pid);
        let process = result.next().unwrap();
        if result.next().is_some() {
            panic!("Found two vectors of processes with the same id, maintainers should fix this.");
        }
        debug!("End of get process name.");
        process.first().unwrap().process.comm.clone()
    }

    /// Returns the cmdline string associated to a PID
    pub fn get_process_cmdline(&self, pid: Pid) -> Option<String> {

```
