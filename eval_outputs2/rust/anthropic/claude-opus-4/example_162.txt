Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add new module declarations to what appears to be a list of system monitoring modules. The HEAD branch is adding `mod focused_window;` while the other branch is adding `mod disk;`. These are both independent modules that serve different purposes, so the semantic intent is to include both modules in the codebase.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```rust
#[cfg(windows)]
mod audio;
mod battery;
mod cpu;
mod disk;
mod focused_window;
mod host;
mod ip;
#[cfg(windows)]
mod keyboard;
#[cfg(windows)]
```
