Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - they both want to return the `msg` value that was created from the match expression. The only difference is stylistic:

- HEAD version: Uses implicit return (the match expression is the last expression in the block)
- The other branch: Explicitly assigns to `msg` and then returns it

Since both achieve the same result, I'll resolve this by choosing the more concise and idiomatic Rust style (implicit return):

```rust
                Ok(v) => match serde_json::from_str(&v) {
                    Ok(data1) => Msg::ReceivedData(data1),
                    Err(err) => Msg::JsonError(err),
                },
                Err(e) => Msg::RequestError(e),
            }
        })
    }
}
