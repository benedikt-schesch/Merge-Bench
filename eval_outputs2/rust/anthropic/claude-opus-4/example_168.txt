Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they want to use the `Debug` trait in the generic constraint. The only difference is:

- HEAD uses the fully qualified path: `fmt::Debug`
- The other branch uses just `Debug`

Since `Debug` is being used without the `fmt::` prefix in the merged branch, this suggests that `Debug` is likely imported at the top of the file (e.g., `use std::fmt::Debug;`). This would make the shorter form valid and more idiomatic.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
pub enum Scope<'a> {
    Operation(Option<&'a str>),
    Fragment(&'a str),
}

pub fn factory<'a, S: Debug>() -> VariableInAllowedPosition<'a, S> {
    VariableInAllowedPosition {
        spreads: HashMap::new(),
        variable_usages: HashMap::new(),
        variable_defs: HashMap::new(),
        current_scope: None,

```
