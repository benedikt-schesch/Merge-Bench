Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Does not include `storage_type` in the `Clone` implementation
- **Incoming change**: Adds `storage_type: self.storage_type,` to the clone method

This appears to be a case where the incoming branch added a new field `storage_type` to the `ChangeTrackersFetch<T>` struct, and the `Clone` implementation needs to be updated to include this field.

Since this is a `Clone` implementation, it should clone all fields of the struct. The semantic intent is clear: if `storage_type` is a field of the struct, it must be included in the `Clone` implementation to maintain correctness.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
}

impl<T> Clone for ChangeTrackersFetch<T> {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        Self {
            storage_type: self.storage_type,
            table_ticks: self.table_ticks,
            entity_table_rows: self.entity_table_rows,
            entities: self.entities,
            sparse_set: self.sparse_set,
            marker: self.marker,
```
