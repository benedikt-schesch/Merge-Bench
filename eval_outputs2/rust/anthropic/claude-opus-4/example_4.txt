Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to initialize a `Client` struct, but with some differences:

**HEAD side:**
- Uses `session` and `spotify` parameters passed to the function
- Uses async `reqwest::Client::new()`

**Other side:**
- Uses `Spotify::default()` instead of the passed `spotify` parameter
- Uses blocking `reqwest::blocking::Client::new()`
- References an `oauth` field instead of `session`

The function signature shows it expects `session: Session` and `spotify: Spotify` parameters. The HEAD side respects these parameters while the other side ignores the `spotify` parameter and uses a different field name (`oauth` vs `session`).

Since the function signature dictates what should be used, and without more context about whether this should be async or blocking, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The semantic intent is ambiguous - one side wants async with provided parameters, the other wants blocking with different field names.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust

impl Client {
    /// creates the new `Client` given a spotify authorization
    pub fn new(session: Session, spotify: Spotify) -> Self {
        Self {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            session,
            spotify,
            http: reqwest::Client::new(),
=======
            spotify: Spotify::default(),
            http: reqwest::blocking::Client::new(),
            oauth,
>>>>>>> d291d456a6ab54e316adf9ce40bdd6f2fa529f7a
        }
    }

    /// handles a client event
    pub fn handle_event(
