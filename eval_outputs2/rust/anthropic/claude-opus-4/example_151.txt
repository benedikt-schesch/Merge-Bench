Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to document the `shortcut_keys` field, but with slightly different descriptions:

- HEAD: "pressed shortcut keys during the proximity event"
- Incoming: "whether a shortcut key is pressed during the down event"

The key differences are:
1. HEAD mentions "proximity event" while the incoming change correctly refers to "down event" (which matches the context of the `Down` variant)
2. HEAD uses plural form suggesting multiple keys can be pressed
3. Incoming uses singular form but the field type is `Vec<ShortcutKey>` which supports multiple keys

Given that:
- This is documenting the `Down` variant, not a proximity event
- The field type is `Vec<ShortcutKey>` which can hold multiple shortcut keys
- Both sides want to document which shortcut keys are pressed

The semantic intent is to document the shortcut keys that are pressed during the down event. Here's the resolved version:

```rust
pub enum PenEvent {
    /// A pen down event. Is repeatedly emitted while the pen is pressed and moved
    Down {
        /// The element for the down event
        element: Element,
        /// Shortcut keys pressed during the down event
        shortcut_keys: Vec<ShortcutKey>,
    },
    /// A pen up event.
    Up {
        /// The element for the down event

```
