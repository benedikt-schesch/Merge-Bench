Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD wants: `use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};`
- The other branch (7d41e7d260b0681eea5c310f288ac43f331b4c8d) wants: `use std::path::Path;`

The conflict is about whether to import both `Path` and `PathBuf` or just `Path`. Since HEAD is including `PathBuf` in addition to `Path`, it likely means that somewhere in the code below (not shown in this snippet), `PathBuf` is being used. The other branch only needs `Path`.

Following the principle of preserving functionality from both sides, and since including `PathBuf` doesn't hurt if it's not used (and likely is needed by HEAD's changes), the semantically correct resolution is to keep both imports.

```rust
use std::fmt::{Debug, Display, Formatter};
#[cfg(feature = "pyo3")]
use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};
#[cfg(feature = "pyo3")]
use std::ops::Deref;
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
use std::str::FromStr;

#[cfg(feature = "pyo3")]
use pyo3::{
    create_exception, exceptions::PyNotImplementedError, pyclass, pyclass::CompareOp, pymethods,

```
