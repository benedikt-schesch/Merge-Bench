Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same `ChildBuilder` struct, but with different lifetime parameter ordering:

- HEAD version: `<'w, 's, 'a>`
- Incoming version: `<'s, 'w, 'a>`

The key observation is that both versions use the same lifetimes for the `Commands` type reference, just in different orders:
- HEAD: `Commands<'w, 's>`
- Incoming: `Commands<'s, 'w>`

Since lifetime parameter order in the struct definition should match their usage, and the incoming change appears to be making the struct definition consistent with how `Commands` is actually parameterized, I'll resolve this by accepting the incoming change:

```rust
pub struct PushChildren {
    parent: Entity,
    children: SmallVec<[Entity; 8]>,
}

pub struct ChildBuilder<'s, 'w, 'a> {
    commands: &'a mut Commands<'s, 'w>,
    push_children: PushChildren,
}

impl Command for PushChildren {
    fn write(self, world: &mut World) {

```
