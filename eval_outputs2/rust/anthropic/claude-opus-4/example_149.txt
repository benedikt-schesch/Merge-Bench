Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

**HEAD side**: Imports specific modules from `super::penbehaviour` and uses `EngineView`, `EngineViewMut` from the engine module, plus some other imports.

**Other side**: Imports `EngineTaskSender` from the engine module and several other types like `Camera`, `Document`, `StrokeStore`, `SurfaceFlags`.

Both sides want to import from the `crate::engine` module but with different items, and both want to import `DrawOnDocBehaviour` from the crate root. The HEAD side also wants `WidgetFlags` while the other side wants additional types.

Since both sides have legitimate imports that appear to be needed, the semantic resolution is to merge all the imports together, combining what both sides need:

```rust
use super::penbehaviour::{PenBehaviour, PenProgress};
use crate::engine::{EngineTaskSender, EngineView, EngineViewMut};
use crate::{Camera, Document, DrawOnDocBehaviour, StrokeStore, SurfaceFlags, WidgetFlags};
use piet::RenderContext;
use rnote_compose::color;
use rnote_compose::helpers::AABBHelpers;
use rnote_compose::penhelpers::PenEvent;
use rnote_compose::penpath::Element;
```
