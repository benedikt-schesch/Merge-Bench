Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import modules from `gleam_core`, but with some differences:

**HEAD (left side):**
- Has a commented out `flate2` import
- Imports `DirEntry` and `ReadDir` from `gleam_core::io`
- Uses a single-line import style

**Right side:**
- Does not have the `flate2` import
- Imports `DirEntry` from the `ignore` crate instead of `gleam_core::io`
- Does not import `ReadDir`
- Uses a multi-line formatted import style

The semantic intent appears to be that the right side has refactored to use `ignore::DirEntry` instead of `gleam_core::io::DirEntry`, and has removed the `ReadDir` import (possibly because it's no longer needed). The right side also has better formatting.

Here's the resolved version that preserves the right side's intent while keeping the formatting:

```rust
// use flate2::{write::GzEncoder, Compression};
use gleam_core::{
    error::{Error, FileIoAction, FileKind},
    io::{
        CommandExecutor, FileSystemIO, FileSystemWriter, OutputFile, WrappedReader, WrappedWriter,
    },
    Result,
};
use ignore::DirEntry;
use lazy_static::lazy_static;
use std::{
    ffi::OsStr,
    fmt::Debug,
    fs::File,
```
