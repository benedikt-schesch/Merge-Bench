Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to document the same content about plugin groups available by default. The only difference is:

- HEAD version: Uses plain text with backticks for inline code formatting: `DefaultPlugins` and `MinimalPlugins`
- Other version: Uses Rust doc link syntax with square brackets: [`DefaultPlugins`] and [`MinimalPlugins`]

The semantic intent is the same - both want to reference these two plugin groups. The conflict is purely about formatting style. In Rust documentation, the `[`...`]` syntax creates clickable links to other items in the documentation, which is generally preferred for better navigation and discoverability.

Since the doc link syntax provides better functionality (clickable links) while maintaining the same semantic meaning, I'll resolve in favor of the version with square brackets:

```rust
    /// Adds a group of plugins
    ///
    /// Bevy plugins can be grouped into a set of plugins. Bevy provides
    /// built-in PluginGroups that provide core engine functionality.
    ///
    /// The plugin groups available by default are [`DefaultPlugins`] and [`MinimalPlugins`].
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// ```
    /// # use bevy_app::{prelude::*, PluginGroupBuilder};
    /// #
```
