Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add parameters to what appears to be a function call or struct initialization. The HEAD branch adds `is_already_polyfilled` and `ctx`, while the other branch adds `is_patch_esm_flag`. 

Since both sides seem to be adding different parameters that likely serve different purposes (polyfill-related flag vs ESM patching flag), and there's no indication that these are mutually exclusive, the semantic intent appears to be to include all three parameters.

```rust
      source,
      export,
      bundle_variable,
      module_analyzer_manager,
      polyfill,
      is_already_polyfilled,
      ctx,
      is_patch_esm_flag
    ),
  }
}

/// generate bundle import

```
