Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same component definition, but with slightly different approaches:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Uses `#[derive(Component, Reflect, Default)]` - explicitly deriving the `Component` trait
- **Incoming change**: Uses `#[derive(Reflect, Default)]` without the `Component` derive, but relies on `#[reflect(Component)]` to handle component behavior

Both sides also updated the comment from "FromResources" to "FromWorld", showing they're both working towards the same API update.

The semantic intent of both changes is the same: to create a component that implements reflection and has default construction. The incoming change appears to be using a newer pattern where the `Component` trait is handled through the reflection system rather than being explicitly derived.

Since the `#[reflect(Component)]` attribute is present in both versions and serves to make the reflection system aware of component behaviors, the incoming change's approach (without explicitly deriving `Component`) appears to be the more modern/correct pattern.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
// Registered components must implement the `Reflect` and `FromWorld` traits.
// The `Reflect` trait enables serialization, deserialization, and dynamic property access.
// `Reflect` enable a bunch of cool behaviors, so its worth checking out the dedicated `reflect.rs`
// example. The `FromWorld` trait determines how your component is constructed when it loads.
// For simple use cases you can just implement the `Default` trait (which automatically implements
// FromWorld). The simplest registered component just needs these two derives:
#[derive(Reflect, Default)]
#[reflect(Component)] // this tells the reflect derive to also reflect component behaviors
struct ComponentA {
    pub x: f32,
    pub y: f32,
}

```
