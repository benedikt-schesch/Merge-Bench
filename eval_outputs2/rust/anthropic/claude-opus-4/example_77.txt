No reasoning found</think>
Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to initialize a component ID, but using different approaches:

- **HEAD** (left side): Creates a `storages` variable and uses `components.init_component::<W<usize>>(&mut storages)`
- **Right side**: Uses `components.get_or_insert_id::<usize>()` without needing the `storages` variable

The key difference is:
- HEAD wraps the type in `W<...>` and requires a mutable reference to `storages`
- The right side uses the type directly and doesn't need `storages`

Since the right side's approach is simpler and doesn't require the additional `storages` variable that isn't used elsewhere in the visible code, and both achieve the same goal of getting a component ID, I'll resolve in favor of the simpler approach:

```rust

    #[test]
    fn table() {
        let mut components = Components::default();
        let component_id = components.get_or_insert_id::<usize>();
        let columns = &[component_id];
        let mut table = Table::with_capacity(0, columns.len());
        table.add_column(components.get_info(component_id).unwrap());
        let entities = (0..200).map(Entity::new).collect::<Vec<_>>();
        for entity in entities.iter() {

```
