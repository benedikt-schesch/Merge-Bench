Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define MMIO (Memory-Mapped I/O) regions, but with different approaches:

- HEAD: Defines UART0 with size 0xa000 and has a commented-out VIRTIO entry with GPU support (size 0x9000)
- The other branch: Defines both UART0 and VIRTIO as active entries, each with size 0x1000

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want UART0 at address 0x1000_0000
2. Both sides acknowledge VIRTIO at address 0x1000_1000
3. HEAD seems to have disabled VIRTIO (commented out) possibly due to GPU-related issues
4. The other branch has VIRTIO enabled with a smaller memory region

Given that the code includes `BlockDeviceImpl = crate::drivers::block::VirtIOBlock`, it seems the system expects VirtIO support. The most reasonable resolution would be to keep VIRTIO enabled but use the larger memory region from HEAD (0x9000) which accommodates GPU support, even if GPU isn't currently being used.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
pub const CLOCK_FREQ: usize = 12500000;

pub const MMIO: &[(usize, usize)] = &[
    (0x1000_0000, 0xa000),    // VIRT_UART0 in virt machine
    (0x1000_1000, 0x9000),    // VIRT_VIRTIO with GPU in virt machine
    (0x0C00_0000, 0x40_0000), // VIRT_PLIC in virt machine
    (0x0010_0000, 0x00_2000), // VIRT_TEST/RTC  in virt machine
];

pub type BlockDeviceImpl = crate::drivers::block::VirtIOBlock;

```
