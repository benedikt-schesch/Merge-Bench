Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to transform a plan/pipeline using the same subrules, but with different approaches:

- HEAD: Uses `pipeline.transform_up()` and chains `.map()` and `.and_then(check_integrity)` to get a `state`
- The other branch: Uses `plan.transform_up()` and stores the result in `new_plan`

The key difference is that HEAD performs an integrity check and extracts data into `state`, while the other branch just stores the transformed plan as `new_plan`. 

Looking at the context after the conflict, I can see that `new_plan` is used later with another `transform_up` call. This suggests the other branch's approach is what's needed for the subsequent code to work.

However, HEAD's integrity check seems important to preserve. The best resolution would be to apply the transformation to get `new_plan` (as needed by subsequent code) while also performing the integrity check from HEAD.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
    pub(crate) fn crosscheck_plans(plan: Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>) -> Result<()> {
        let subrules: Vec<Box<PipelineFixerSubrule>> = vec![
            Box::new(hash_join_convert_symmetric_subrule),
            Box::new(hash_join_swap_subrule),
        ];
        let new_plan =
            plan.transform_up(&|p| apply_subrules(p, &subrules, &ConfigOptions::new()))?;
        let state = check_integrity(new_plan.data.clone())?;
        // TODO: End state payloads will be checked here.
        let config = ConfigOptions::new().optimizer;
        let collect_left_threshold = config.hash_join_single_partition_threshold;
        let collect_threshold_num_rows = config.hash_join_single_partition_threshold_rows;
        let _ = new_plan.transform_up(&|plan| {

```
