Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import items from `crate::colors`, but they differ in what they're importing:

- HEAD (current branch): imports `ResultsListColors` and `BORDER_COLOR`
- Incoming branch: imports `ResultsListColors`, `BORDER_COLOR`, and `DEFAULT_RESULTS_LIST_MATCH_FOREGROUND_COLOR`

The semantic intent appears to be that the incoming branch is adding an additional import (`DEFAULT_RESULTS_LIST_MATCH_FOREGROUND_COLOR`) to the existing imports. This is a common pattern where one branch adds functionality that requires additional imports.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
use crate::colors::{
    ResultsListColors, BORDER_COLOR,
    DEFAULT_RESULTS_LIST_MATCH_FOREGROUND_COLOR,
};
use crate::layout::InputPosition;
use color_eyre::eyre::Result;
use ratatui::layout::{Alignment, Rect};
use ratatui::prelude::{Color, Line, Span, Style};
use ratatui::widgets::{
```
