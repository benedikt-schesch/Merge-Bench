Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD side: Has `Permissions { flags, .. }` and `Interpreter { flags }`
- Other side: Has `Boundaries { flags }`, `Stepper { flags, .. }`, and `Interpreter { flags, .. }`

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to handle `Interpreter`, though with different destructuring patterns
2. HEAD introduces `Permissions` 
3. The other side introduces `Boundaries` and `Stepper`

Since this is a pattern match that extracts `flags` from different command variants, and both sides are adding new variants, the resolution should include all variants from both sides. For `Interpreter`, I'll use the more flexible pattern with `..` from the other side.

```rust
      }
      _ => {}
    };

    let flags = match &args.command {
      Permissions { flags, .. } => flags,
      Boundaries { flags } => flags,
      Stepper { flags, .. } => flags,
      Interpreter { flags, .. } => flags,
      _ => unreachable!(),
    };

    RustcPluginArgs {
      flags: Some(flags.clone()),

```
