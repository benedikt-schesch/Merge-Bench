Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch includes `ComponentStorage` in the imports while the other branch does not. Without more context about how `ComponentStorage` is used in the rest of the file, I cannot determine whether it should be included or not.

Since the intent is ambiguous and I don't have enough information to resolve this conflict semantically, I'm returning the snippet unchanged:

```rust
use crate::{
    archetype::{Archetype, ArchetypeComponentId},
<<<<<<< HEAD
    component::{Component, ComponentId, ComponentStorage, ComponentTicks, StorageType},
=======
    component::{Component, ComponentId, ComponentTicks, StorageType},
>>>>>>> 65e834ce8d5142f1a01d06c2a9e4e7ef4a1238a9
    entity::Entity,
    query::{Access, Fetch, FetchState, FilteredAccess, WorldQuery},
    storage::{ComponentSparseSet, Table, Tables},
    world::World,
};
```
