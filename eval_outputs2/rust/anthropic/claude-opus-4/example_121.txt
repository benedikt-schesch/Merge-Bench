Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

1. The HEAD branch adds an early return optimization: if `qt` and `st` are equal, there's no need to overwrite type parameters, so it returns `Ok(None)`.

2. The other branch (b84bd19237cd84a89ca508bc4f415dabaff8da77) removes this optimization entirely.

The semantic intent seems to be about whether to include this equality check optimization. Since the rest of the function proceeds to check `qt.qual_name() == st.qual_name()` and handles specific type cases (union and intersection types), it appears the optimization might have been removed because:
- It could be premature (the equality check might be expensive)
- It might interfere with cases where equal types still need processing
- The subsequent logic already handles the necessary cases

Given that one branch explicitly removed this check while the other added it, and without more context about why it was removed, I'll preserve the conflict as the intent is ambiguous:

```rust
    pub(crate) fn overwrite_typarams(
        ctx: &'c Context,
        qt: &Type,
        st: &Type,
    ) -> EvalResult<Option<Self>> {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        if qt == st {
            return Ok(None);
        }

        let mut qtps = qt.typarams();
        let mut stps = st.typarams();
        if qt.qual_name() == st.qual_name() {
            if st.is_union_type() || st.is_intersection_type() {
                let mut q_indices = vec![];
