Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- The `HEAD` version uses `T: StateData` as the trait bound
- The incoming change uses `T: Component + Debug + Clone + Eq + Hash` as the trait bounds

This appears to be a refactoring where `StateData` trait is being replaced with a more explicit set of trait bounds. The semantic intent is to define what requirements a type `T` must satisfy to be used as a state.

Since `StateData` is likely a trait that encompasses all or most of these individual traits (`Component + Debug + Clone + Eq + Hash`), and the incoming change appears to be making these requirements more explicit (possibly as part of removing the `StateData` trait), I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change.

```rust
    /// Each stage that uses `State<T>` for system run criteria needs a driver. If you need to use
    /// your state in a different stage, consider using [Self::add_state_to_stage] or manually
    /// adding [State::get_driver] to additional stages you need it in.
    pub fn add_state<T>(&mut self, initial: T) -> &mut Self
    where
        T: Component + Debug + Clone + Eq + Hash,
    {
        self.add_state_to_stage(CoreStage::Update, initial)
    }

    /// Adds a new [State] with the given `initial` value.

```
