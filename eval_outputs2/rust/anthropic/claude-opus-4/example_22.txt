Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD branch is implementing `PartialEq<ConflictKind> for ConflictKindRef<'a>`
2. The other branch is implementing `PartialEq<ConflictPackage> for ConflictPackageRef<'_>`

These appear to be two different trait implementations for different types that were added in parallel. The conflict seems to be a result of both branches adding implementations in the same location, but they're for different types entirely (`ConflictKind`/`ConflictKindRef` vs `ConflictPackage`/`ConflictPackageRef`).

Since these are implementations for different types and both seem intentional, the semantic resolution would be to keep both implementations. Here's the resolved code:

```rust
    fn from(group: &'a GroupName) -> ConflictKindRef<'a> {
        ConflictKindRef::Group(group)
    }
}

impl<'a> PartialEq<ConflictKind> for ConflictKindRef<'a> {
    fn eq(&self, other: &ConflictKind) -> bool {
        other.as_ref() == *self
    }
}

impl PartialEq<ConflictPackage> for ConflictPackageRef<'_> {
    fn eq(&self, other: &ConflictPackage) -> bool {
        other.as_ref() == *self
    }
}

impl<'a> PartialEq<ConflictKindRef<'a>> for ConflictKind {

```
