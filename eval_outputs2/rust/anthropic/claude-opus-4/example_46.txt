Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD wants the type constraint to be `T: Resource`
- The incoming change wants the type constraint to be `T: Component`

Given that this is an `insert_resource` method that is inserting resources into the app, and the method explicitly calls `self.world.insert_resource(resource)`, the semantic intent is clearly to work with resources, not components. 

The `Resource` constraint makes more semantic sense here as:
1. The method name is `insert_resource`
2. The documentation comment shows inserting a resource
3. The implementation calls `insert_resource` on the world

Therefore, HEAD's version with `T: Resource` is the semantically correct choice:

```rust
    /// App::new()
    ///    .insert_resource(MyCounter { counter: 0 });
    /// ```
    pub fn insert_resource<T>(&mut self, resource: T) -> &mut Self
    where
        T: Resource,
    {
        self.world.insert_resource(resource);
        self
    }
