Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar goals but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Uses a macro `deserialize_chat_template!` to get both `chat_template` and `gen_conf` in one call
- **Other branch**: Explicitly gets the tokenizer first, then manually deserializes `gen_conf` from JSON, and finally gets the chat_template

The key difference is that the other branch explicitly needs the `tokenizer` variable (which HEAD doesn't seem to require), while HEAD uses a more concise macro approach.

Since both sides need `chat_template` and `gen_conf`, and the other branch additionally needs `tokenizer`, the semantic intent appears to be to initialize all necessary components. The best resolution would incorporate getting the tokenizer (from the other branch) while potentially using the macro for the other components if it's compatible.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
                }
            }
            _ => unreachable!(),
        };

        let tokenizer = get_tokenizer(paths.get_tokenizer_filename())?;

        let gen_conf: Option<GenerationConfig> = paths
            .get_gen_conf_filename()
            .map(|f| serde_json::from_str(&fs::read_to_string(f).unwrap()).unwrap());
        let chat_template = get_chat_template(paths, &self.chat_template);

        let max_seq_len = match model {
            Model::Llama(ref l) => l.max_seq_len,
            Model::Phi2(ref p) => p.max_seq_len,
            Model::XLoraLlama(ref xl) => xl.max_seq_len,
