Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they're both implementing an empty function body for the `build` method. The only difference is formatting:

- HEAD version: `{;}` (empty block with semicolon)
- Other version: `{ }` (empty block with space)

The idiomatic Rust way to write an empty function body is `{ }` (with a space), which matches the other version. This is also more consistent with typical Rust formatting conventions.

```rust
    /// #     }
    /// # }
    /// #
    /// # struct MyOwnPlugin;
    /// # impl Plugin for MyOwnPlugin {
    /// #     fn build(&self, app: &mut App) { }
    /// # }
    /// #
    /// App::new()
    ///      .add_plugins_with(DefaultPlugins, |group| {
    ///             group.add_before::<bevy_log::LogPlugin, _>(MyOwnPlugin)
```
