Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different content to what appears to be a library file (`lib.rs`).

The HEAD side is:
- Adding a module declaration for `dict_codegen`
- Re-exporting everything from that module

The incoming side is:
- Adding an attribute to allow non-snake_case naming (with a TODO to remove it)
- Adding a struct for README doctests with documentation

These changes appear to be addressing different concerns and both can coexist. The HEAD side is setting up the actual library functionality (dict_codegen module), while the incoming side is adding documentation testing infrastructure.

Here's the resolved version:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_auto_cfg))]
#![warn(clippy::print_stderr)]
#![warn(clippy::print_stdout)]
#![allow(non_snake_case)] // TODO: Delete me

mod dict_codegen;

pub use crate::dict_codegen::*;

#[doc = include_str!("../README.md")]
#[cfg(doctest)]
pub struct ReadmeDoctests;

```
