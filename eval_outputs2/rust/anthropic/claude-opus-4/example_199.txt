Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has the imports without the `log::trace` import, while the other side adds `use log::trace;`. 

Since this is just an import statement addition with no conflicting changes, the semantic intent is clear: the branch `28ee14a75cbb06310e0da03b61eba7789b71a7ed` added logging functionality that requires the `trace` macro from the `log` crate. This is a non-conflicting addition that should be included.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
use crate::metrics::Metrics;
use crate::stream_context::StreamContext;
use common::configuration::{Configuration, Overrides, PromptGuards, PromptTarget, Tracing};
use common::http::Client;
use common::stats::Gauge;
use log::trace;
use proxy_wasm::traits::*;
use proxy_wasm::types::*;
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::rc::Rc;

```
