Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to modify the same line that calls `simpl_log`. 

The HEAD version:
- Returns `Transformed::yes()` wrapping the result of `simpl_log`
- Clones `info` using `<&S>::clone(&info)`

The incoming change (767760b84c71b9af8b2d8cdee9cd5c099b57b462):
- Calls `simpl_log` directly without wrapping in `Transformed::yes()`
- Passes `info` directly without cloning

Based on the pattern and the fact that the incoming change appears to be a simplification (removing unnecessary cloning and wrapping), the semantic intent seems to be to streamline the code. The incoming version is likely the correct resolution as it removes what appears to be unnecessary complexity.

```rust

            // log
            Expr::ScalarFunction(ScalarFunction {
                func_def: ScalarFunctionDefinition::BuiltIn(BuiltinScalarFunction::Log),
                args,
            }) => simpl_log(args, info)?,

            // power
            Expr::ScalarFunction(ScalarFunction {
                func_def: ScalarFunctionDefinition::BuiltIn(BuiltinScalarFunction::Power),
                args,
