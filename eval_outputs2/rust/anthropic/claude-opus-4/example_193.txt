Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add new fields to what appears to be a function parameter list. The HEAD side wants to add `id_prefix` and `all_symbols_section_prefix` (both `Option<String>`), while the other branch wants to add `readme_source` of type `ReadmeSource`.

Since these are independent additions that don't conflict semantically - they're just adding different parameters - the resolution should include all three new parameters. Here's the resolved code:

```rust
  version_is_latest: bool,
  github_repository: Option<GithubRepository>,
  readme: Option<String>,
  runtime_compat: RuntimeCompat,
  registry_url: String,
  id_prefix: Option<String>,
  all_symbols_section_prefix: Option<String>,
  readme_source: ReadmeSource,
) -> Result<Option<GeneratedDocsOutput>, anyhow::Error> {
  let ctx = get_generate_ctx(
    doc_nodes_by_url,
    main_entrypoint,
    rewrite_map,
```
