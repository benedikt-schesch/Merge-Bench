Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD has just the `use std::{` import statement
- The other branch (24a95b4) adds a clippy allow attribute `#![allow(clippy::needless_update)]` before the imports and also adds `collections::HashMap,` to the import list

Since both changes appear to be intentional additions that don't conflict semantically:
1. The clippy attribute is a lint configuration that should be preserved
2. The HashMap import is likely needed for code elsewhere in the file

The resolution should include both changes:

```rust
#![allow(clippy::needless_update)]

use std::{
  collections::HashMap,
  fs,
  path::{Path, PathBuf},
  sync::Arc,
};
