Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to create an expression with window function parameters. The conflict appears to be about:

- HEAD: Wrapping the expression in an additional layer (extra parentheses with `))))`
- The incoming change: Adding a `null_treatment` parameter and explicitly returning with `Ok(expr)`

Based on the semantic intent, it seems both changes should be incorporated - the incoming change adds the `null_treatment` parameter (which is likely a new feature), and both sides want to return an Ok result. The HEAD's extra parentheses suggest it's wrapping the entire expression construction.

Here's the resolved version:

```rust
                    fun,
                    args,
                    partition_by,
                    order_by,
                    window_frame,
                    null_treatment,
                ))))
            }
            Expr::Alias(_)
            | Expr::Column(_)
            | Expr::ScalarVariable(_, _)
            | Expr::Literal(_)
```
