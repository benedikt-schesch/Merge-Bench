Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import different items from the crate:

- HEAD wants: `EngineView` and `EngineViewMut` from `crate::engine`
- The incoming branch wants: `AudioPlayer` from `super`, `Document` from `crate::document`, and `EngineTaskSender` from `crate::engine`

Since both sides are adding imports that serve different purposes and don't appear to be mutually exclusive, the semantic intent is to include all the imports. The resolution should combine both sets of imports.

```rust
use super::penbehaviour::{PenBehaviour, PenProgress};
use super::AudioPlayer;
use crate::document::Document;
use crate::engine::{EngineTaskSender, EngineView, EngineViewMut};
use crate::strokes::ShapeStroke;
use crate::strokes::Stroke;
use crate::{DrawOnDocBehaviour, WidgetFlags};

use p2d::bounding_volume::AABB;

```
