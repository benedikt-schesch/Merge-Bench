Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to construct what appears to be a struct (likely related to window or aggregate functions), but they have different endings:

- HEAD side: ends with `}))`
- Other side: adds a `null_treatment` field and ends with `})`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wanted to close the struct and wrap it in something (extra parenthesis)
- The other branch added a new `null_treatment` field to the struct

To properly merge these changes, we need to include the new `null_treatment` field AND maintain the correct closing syntax from HEAD:

```rust
                        ),
                        args: vec![lit(COUNT_STAR_EXPANSION)],
                        partition_by,
                        order_by,
                        window_frame,
                        null_treatment,
                    }))
                }

                _ => Transformed::no(old_expr),
            },
            Expr::AggregateFunction(AggregateFunction {
```
