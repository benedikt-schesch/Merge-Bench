Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add new module declarations to what appears to be a list of container-related operations in Rust.

The HEAD branch is adding two modules:
- `center_cursor_on_container` 
- `exec_process`

The incoming branch is adding one module:
- `detach_container`

Since these are just module declarations and all three modules represent different functionality (centering cursor, executing process, and detaching container), the semantic intent is to include all three modules. They don't conflict with each other functionally.

Here's the resolved version:

```rust
mod attach_container;
mod center_cursor_on_container;
mod detach_container;
mod exec_process;
mod flatten_split_container;
mod redraw;
mod resize_tiling_container;
mod set_active_window_border;
mod set_focused_descendant;
```
