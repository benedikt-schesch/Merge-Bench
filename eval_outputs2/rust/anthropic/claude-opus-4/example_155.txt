Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import different items from `crate::engine`:

- HEAD wants to import `EngineView` and `EngineViewMut`
- The other branch wants to import `EngineTaskSender` (plus `Document` from a different module)

Since both sides are importing from the same `engine` module but different items, and there's no apparent semantic conflict between these imports, the resolution should include all of them. Here's the resolved version:

```rust
use crate::document::Document;
use crate::engine::{EngineTaskSender, EngineView, EngineViewMut};
use crate::store::StrokeKey;
use crate::{DrawOnDocBehaviour, WidgetFlags};
use piet::RenderContext;
use rnote_compose::color;
use rnote_compose::helpers::{AABBHelpers, Vector2Helpers};

```
