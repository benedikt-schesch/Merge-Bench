Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Has just the `WorldQuery` trait definition
- **Incoming change**: Adds a type alias `QueryItem` that provides a convenient way to access the `Item` type from a `WorldQuery`'s associated `Fetch` type

The semantic intent appears to be:
- The `WorldQuery` trait defines a query with associated `Fetch` and `State` types
- The incoming change wants to add a utility type alias that makes it easier to refer to the item type that a query yields
- Both changes are complementary - the type alias depends on the `WorldQuery` trait and provides additional functionality

Since these changes don't conflict semantically and the type alias is a useful addition that builds on top of the `WorldQuery` trait, I'll resolve by keeping both:

```rust
pub trait WorldQuery {
    type Fetch: for<'world, 'state> Fetch<'world, 'state, State = Self::State>;
    type State: FetchState;
}

pub type QueryItem<'w, 's, Q> = <<Q as WorldQuery>::Fetch as Fetch<'w, 's>>::Item;

pub trait Fetch<'world, 'state>: Sized {
    type Item;
    type State: FetchState;

    /// Creates a new instance of this fetch.

```
