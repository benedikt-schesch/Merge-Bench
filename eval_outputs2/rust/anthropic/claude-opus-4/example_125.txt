Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to initialize data structures at the beginning of the `write_cache` function:

- HEAD: Only initializes `packages` using `HashMap::default()`
- The other branch: Initializes the same `packages` using `HashMap::new()` (functionally equivalent) AND adds two additional HashSet initializations

Since this is a semantic merge where both sides appear to have valid intentions:
- Both want to initialize `packages` (just using different but equivalent methods)
- The other branch additionally needs `pending_remove_modules` and `maybe_remove_package` HashSets

The resolution should include all three data structure initializations, using a consistent initialization style:

```rust

    None
  }

  fn write_cache(&self) {
    let mut packages = HashMap::new();
    let mut pending_remove_modules = HashSet::new();
    let mut maybe_remove_package = HashSet::new();

    for item in self.cached_modules.iter() {
      let module = item.value();

      let package_key =

```
