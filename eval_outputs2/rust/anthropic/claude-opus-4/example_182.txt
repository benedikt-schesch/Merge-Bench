Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they both want to call `listener.retain(|event, _| *event != attr.name)`. The only difference is that HEAD has a semicolon at the end of the statement, while the other branch doesn't.

In Rust, statements inside blocks should end with semicolons, so the HEAD version is correct. The semantic intent is identical in both versions.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
                                let DomInner::Element { listeners, .. } = &target_element.inner
                                else {
                                    unreachable!("must be an element");
                                };
                                if let Some(listener) = listeners.borrow_mut().as_mut() {
                                    listener.retain(|event, _| *event != attr.name);
                                }
                            }
                            DomAttrValue::Style(_) => {
                                target_element.remove_dom_attr(attr)?;
                            }

```
