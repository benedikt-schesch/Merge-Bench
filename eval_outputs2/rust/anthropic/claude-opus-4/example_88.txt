Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import the same modules, just with different organization:

- HEAD: imports `serde::Deserialize` first, then `crate::{app::AppExit, App}`
- The other branch: imports `crate::app::{App, AppExit}` first, then `bevy_ecs::system::IntoSystem`, then `serde::Deserialize`

The semantic intent is clear - both sides need these imports. The other branch additionally needs `bevy_ecs::system::IntoSystem`. The best resolution is to include all imports in a clean, organized way:

```rust
use crate::app::{App, AppExit};
use bevy_ecs::system::IntoSystem;
use serde::Deserialize;

/// Configuration for automated testing on CI
#[derive(Deserialize)]
pub struct CiTestingConfig {
    /// Number of frames after wich Bevy should exit

```
