Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add a parameter to what appears to be a function call. The HEAD branch is adding two parameters (`is_already_polyfilled` and `options`), while the other branch is adding a mutable reference parameter (`&mut is_patch_esm_flag`).

Without more context about the function signature and the intent of both changes, I cannot determine which parameters should be kept or if all of them should be included. The conflict appears to be a case where both branches modified the same location to add different parameters.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
      None,
      export,
      bundle_variable,
      module_analyzer_manager,
      polyfill,
<<<<<<< HEAD
      is_already_polyfilled,
      options,
=======
      &mut is_patch_esm_flag,
>>>>>>> 24a95b48172836d31c55697037d5dada7d9c1ef7
    )?);
  }

  let ordered_external_export = bundle_reference
    .external_export_map
```
