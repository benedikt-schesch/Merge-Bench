Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - setting up a logging mechanism with verbosity control - but they're implementing it in different ways:

- **HEAD**: Uses a Rust closure (`Box<Fn(&str) + Send>`) stored in a `spin::Mutex`, with a direct `Verbosity` type
- **Branch**: Uses a C-style function pointer (`unsafe extern "C" fn(*const c_char)`) for FFI compatibility, with verbosity as `u32` that gets converted to `Verbosity`

The semantic intent appears to be to support both Rust-native logging and C FFI logging. Without more context about the project's requirements, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict as it represents a fundamental architectural decision about the logging interface.

Here is the code snippet unchanged:

```rust
        };

        Ok(Box::new(tunn))
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    pub fn set_logger(&mut self, logger: Box<Fn(&str) + Send>, verbosity: Verbosity) {
        self.logger = Some(spin::Mutex::new(logger));
        self.verbosity = verbosity;
=======
    /// Set the external forfunction pointer for the logging function.
    pub fn set_log(&mut self, log: Option<unsafe extern "C" fn(*const c_char)>, verbosity: u32) {
        self.log = log;
        self.verbosity = Verbosity::from(verbosity);

    }

    /// Receives an IP packet from the tunnel interface and encapsulates it.
    /// Returns wireguard_result.
    /// # Panics
