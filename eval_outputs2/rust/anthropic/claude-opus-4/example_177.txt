Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD side has a comment about this being a Rust-GPU port of `motion_blur.hlsl` by Viktor Zoutman
2. The incoming change has `use` statements importing `FrameConstants` and utility functions
3. Below the conflict, there's already an import of `FrameConstants` from `rust_shaders_shared`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants to preserve the attribution comment
- The incoming change wants to add imports, but `FrameConstants` is already being imported from a different module below

Since `FrameConstants` is already imported from `rust_shaders_shared::frame_constants`, we should keep the comment and only add the utility imports that aren't duplicated.

```rust
// Rust-GPU port of `motion_blur.hlsl` by Viktor Zoutman

use crate::util::{depth_to_view_z, get_uv_u};
use macaw::{
    uvec2, vec2, IVec2, IVec3, UVec2, UVec3, Vec2, Vec3, Vec3Swizzles, Vec4, Vec4Swizzles,
};
use rust_shaders_shared::{
    frame_constants::FrameConstants,
