Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD**: Imports `binary::TAsyncBinaryProtocol` along with other imports
- **The other branch (513f8a4...)**: Has the same imports but without `binary::TAsyncBinaryProtocol`

Since this is an import statement conflict, the semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants to use `TAsyncBinaryProtocol` from the `binary` module
- The other branch has reorganized imports but doesn't include this specific import

The most likely resolution is to keep all imports, including the `TAsyncBinaryProtocol` that HEAD added, while maintaining the cleaner organization style from the other branch.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
use std::fmt::{self, Display, Formatter};

use pilota::thrift::{
    binary::TAsyncBinaryProtocol, Error as PilotaError, Message, ProtocolError,
    TAsyncInputProtocol, TFieldIdentifier, TInputProtocol, TLengthProtocol, TOutputProtocol,
    TStructIdentifier, TType, TransportError,
};
use volo::loadbalance::error::{LoadBalanceError, Retryable};

use crate::AnyhowError;
