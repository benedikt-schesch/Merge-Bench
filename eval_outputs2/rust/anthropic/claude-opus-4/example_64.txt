Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add the same system (`hello_world_system`) to a Bevy application, but with different syntax:

- HEAD version: `.add_system(hello_world_system)`
- Other version: `.add_system(hello_world_system.system())`

The `.system()` method was used in older versions of Bevy (prior to 0.6) to convert functions into systems, but it has been deprecated and removed in newer versions. The modern Bevy API accepts functions directly as systems without needing the `.system()` call.

Since the HEAD version uses the current, simpler syntax that is compatible with modern Bevy versions, that's the semantically correct resolution:

```rust
//! ```
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!    App::new()
//!        .add_system(hello_world_system)
//!        .run();
//! }
//!
//! fn hello_world_system() {
//!    println!("hello world");
```
