Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add benchmark suites to the `criterion_main!` macro:

- HEAD has: `matmul` and `random` benchmarks
- The incoming change has: `matmul`, `affine`, and `where_cond` benchmarks

Both sides share `matmul` benchmarks, but each has unique additions. The semantic intent appears to be adding various benchmark suites to the project. Since there's no apparent conflict in intent (just different sets of benchmarks being added), the resolution should include all unique benchmarks from both sides.

```rust
mod benchmarks;

use criterion::criterion_main;
criterion_main!(
    benchmarks::matmul::benches,
    benchmarks::random::benches,
    benchmarks::affine::benches,
    benchmarks::where_cond::benches
);
```
