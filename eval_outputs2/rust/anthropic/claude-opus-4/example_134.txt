Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to pass arguments to a function call. The conflict appears to be about which parameters to include:

- HEAD wants to pass `is_already_polyfilled` and `options`
- The incoming change wants to pass `&mut is_patch_esm_flag`

Without more context about the function signature and the intent of both changes, I cannot determine which parameters are correct or if all of them should be included. The semantic intent is ambiguous.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
>>>>>>> 24a95b48172836d31c55697037d5dada7d9c1ef7
      export,
      bundle_variable,
      module_analyzer_manager,
      polyfill,
<<<<<<< HEAD
      is_already_polyfilled,
      options,
=======
      &mut is_patch_esm_flag
>>>>>>> 24a95b48172836d31c55697037d5dada7d9c1ef7
    )?);
  }

  Ok(patch_export_to_module)
}

```
