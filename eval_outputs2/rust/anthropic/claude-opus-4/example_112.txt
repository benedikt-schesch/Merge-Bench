Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. HEAD is trying to mark MacOS 64 bit as completed/supported with `[x]`
2. The incoming change is trying to add both MacOS 32 bit and 64 bit as unsupported with `[ ]`, and also adds a new section about creating a "nightly" feature with a `use` statement

The semantic conflict here is about the MacOS 64 bit support status. Since HEAD marks it as supported `[x]` while the incoming change marks it as unsupported `[ ]`, and HEAD's change is more recent (marking something as complete), the most likely resolution is to keep MacOS 64 bit as supported while adding the MacOS 32 bit line and the nightly feature documentation.

Here's the resolved version:

```rust
//!
//! - [x] Windows 32 bit
//! - [x] Windows 64 bit
//! - [x] Linux 32 bit
//! - [x] Linux 64 bit
//! - [ ] MacOS 32 bit
//! - [x] MacOS 64 bit
//!
//! This script also creates a "nightly" feature if the crate is compiled on a nightly branch
