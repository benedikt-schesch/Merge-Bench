Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve with the pattern matching on `PubGrubPackage::Package`.

The HEAD version expects 4 fields in the enum variant:
- `package_name`
- `_extra` (unused)
- `None`
- `_source` (unused)

The incoming change expects 3 fields:
- `package_name`
- `None`
- `None`

This appears to be a case where the enum definition has changed between the two branches. The HEAD version has added additional fields (`_extra` and `_source`) that aren't present in the incoming change.

Since both sides still only use `package_name` and the rest of the fields are either ignored (with `_`) or explicitly matched as `None`, the semantic intent is the same: extract the package name from a specific variant of `PubGrubPackage::Package` and continue processing.

The correct resolution would be to use the HEAD version since it appears to be the more recent structure of the enum with additional fields. Here's the resolved code:

```rust
        request_sink: &tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender<Request>,
    ) -> Result<(), ResolveError> {
        // Iterate over the potential packages, and fetch file metadata for any of them. These
        // represent our current best guesses for the versions that we _might_ select.
        for (package, range) in packages {
            let PubGrubPackage::Package(package_name, _extra, None, _source) = package else {
                continue;
            };
            request_sink
                .send(Request::Prefetch(package_name.clone(), range.clone()))
                .await?;

```
