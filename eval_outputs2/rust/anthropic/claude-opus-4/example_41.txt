Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has no comment while the other side adds a comment explaining why `NonSend` is used in the function parameter.

The comment `// we have to use `NonSend` here` appears to be a helpful documentation comment that explains a non-obvious design decision. Since both sides have the same function signature with `NonSend<WinitWindows>`, the comment is purely additive and doesn't conflict with the intent of either side.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
use bevy::window::WindowId;
use bevy::winit::WinitWindows;
use winit::window::Icon;

fn set_window_icon(
    // we have to use `NonSend` here
    windows: NonSend<WinitWindows>,
) {
    let primary = windows.get_window(WindowId::primary()).unwrap();

    // here we use the `image` crate to load our icon data from a png file

```
