Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different parameters to what appears to be a function call. The HEAD branch is adding two parameters (`Some(format!("{}/{}/", scope, package_name))` and `None`), while the other branch is adding `package.readme_source`.

Based on the semantic intent, it seems like:
- HEAD wants to add a formatted path parameter and a None value
- The other branch wants to add the readme source from the package

Since these appear to be different parameters serving different purposes, the resolution should likely include both additions in the correct order. Here's the resolved version:

```rust
    version_or_latest == VersionOrLatest::Latest,
    repo,
    None,
    package.runtime_compat,
    registry_url,
    Some(format!("{}/{}/", scope, package_name)),
    None,
    package.readme_source,
  )
  .map_err(|e| {
    error!("failed to generate docs: {}", e);
    ApiError::InternalServerError
  })?
```
