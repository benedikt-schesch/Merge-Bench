Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- The HEAD (current branch) has a list of constants imported that ends with `USER_ROLE,`
- The incoming change (c7c0553...) wants to add `X_ARCH_FC_MODEL_RESPONSE,` to the imports

Since this is an import statement where both sides likely want to include all necessary constants, the semantic intent appears to be to include both sets of imports. The conflict arose because both sides modified the same line (adding a comma after `USER_ROLE` and adding a new constant).

Here's the resolved version that includes both intents:

```rust
use common::configuration::{Endpoint, Overrides, PromptTarget, Tracing};
use common::consts::{
    API_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS, ARCH_FC_MODEL_NAME, ARCH_INTERNAL_CLUSTER_NAME,
    ARCH_UPSTREAM_HOST_HEADER, ASSISTANT_ROLE, DEFAULT_TARGET_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS, MESSAGES_KEY,
    REQUEST_ID_HEADER, SYSTEM_ROLE, TOOL_ROLE, TRACE_PARENT_HEADER, USER_ROLE,
    X_ARCH_FC_MODEL_RESPONSE,
};
use common::errors::ServerError;
use common::http::{CallArgs, Client};
use common::stats::Gauge;
use derivative::Derivative;

```
