Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to access a directory path for LocalStorage, but they're using different type names:

- HEAD uses `OriginStorageDir`
- The other branch uses `LocationDataDir`

Without more context about the codebase's naming conventions and which type is the correct one to use, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. Both changes appear to have the same intent (getting a storage directory path for LocalStorage), but they disagree on the type name.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
  state: &mut OpState,
  persistent: bool,
) -> Result<&Connection, AnyError> {
  let conn = if persistent {
    if state.try_borrow::<LocalStorage>().is_none() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      let path = state.try_borrow::<OriginStorageDir>().ok_or_else(|| {
=======
      let path = state.try_borrow::<LocationDataDir>().ok_or_else(|| {
>>>>>>> 1567c1013cc8ff12cf039137792da66a1d0015b5
        DomExceptionNotSupportedError::new(
          "LocalStorage is not supported in this context.",
        )
      })?;
      std::fs::create_dir_all(&path.0)?;

```
