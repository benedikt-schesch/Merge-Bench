Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Adds a conditional block that checks if `f` exists and then calls it as a mutable function on `config`
- **Other branch (24a95b4)**: Removes this conditional block entirely

Without more context about what `f` represents and the broader purpose of this code, I cannot determine which side's intent is correct. The conflict represents a fundamental disagreement about whether this optional function call should exist or not.

Since the intent is ambiguous, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
          test: vec![ConfigRegex::new(".+")],
          name: "index".to_string(),
        }];

        config = try_merge_config_file(config, config_entry);
<<<<<<< HEAD

        if let Some(f) = f.as_ref() {
          f(&mut config);
        }
=======
>>>>>>> 24a95b48172836d31c55697037d5dada7d9c1ef7

        (config, plugins)
      },
    );
