Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are adding different imports to the same section of code. The HEAD branch is importing `AudioPlayer` and `WidgetFlags`, while the other branch is importing `Camera`, `Document`, `StrokeStore`, and `SurfaceFlags`. Both sides also include `DrawOnDocBehaviour` in their imports.

Since both sets of imports appear to be additive and there's no semantic conflict between them (they're just different features being added), the resolution should include all the imports from both sides, avoiding duplication of `DrawOnDocBehaviour`.

```rust
use super::penbehaviour::{PenBehaviour, PenProgress};
use crate::engine::{EngineView, EngineViewMut};
use crate::store::StrokeKey;
use crate::strokes::BrushStroke;
use crate::strokes::Stroke;
use crate::AudioPlayer;
use crate::{Camera, Document, DrawOnDocBehaviour, StrokeStore, SurfaceFlags, WidgetFlags};
use piet::RenderContext;
use rnote_compose::builders::shapebuilderbehaviour::{BuilderProgress, ShapeBuilderCreator};
use rnote_compose::builders::Constraints;
use rnote_compose::builders::{PenPathBuilder, ShapeBuilderBehaviour};
use rnote_compose::penhelpers::PenEvent;
use rnote_compose::penpath::Segment;
