Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (the branch being merged in) wants to add a debug log statement that logs the `api_call_body` variable before proceeding with the HTTP request setup. The HEAD version doesn't have this logging.

Since this is just adding a debug log statement that provides useful debugging information without changing any logic, and both sides continue with the same code after this point (setting up the timeout and HTTP method), it makes sense to include the debug statement.

Here's the resolved version:

```rust
                    Some(StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST),
                );
            }
        };

        debug!("on_http_call_response: api call body {:?}", api_call_body);

        let timeout_str = API_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS.to_string();

        let http_method_str = http_method.to_string();
        let mut headers: HashMap<_, _> = [
            (ARCH_UPSTREAM_HOST_HEADER, endpoint_details.name.as_str()),

```
