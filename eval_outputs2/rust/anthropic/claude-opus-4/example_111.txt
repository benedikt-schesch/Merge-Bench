Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to organize the exports, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Exports `ProgressStyle` from the `progress` module and conditionally exports rayon-related items
- **Other branch**: Moves `ProgressBarIter` to the `progress` module exports and separates `ProgressStyle` into its own `style` module export

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to export `ProgressStyle` (just from different modules)
2. The HEAD side wants to keep `ProgressBarIter` in the `iter` module (as seen in the earlier `use iter::{ProgressBarIter, ProgressIterator}` line)
3. The other branch wants to move `ProgressBarIter` to the `progress` module
4. The HEAD side adds conditional rayon exports

Since `ProgressBarIter` is already imported from the `iter` module at the top, it makes more semantic sense to keep it there rather than duplicate it in the `progress` module. The resolution should:
- Keep `ProgressBarIter` in the `iter` module only
- Use the `style::ProgressStyle` approach from the other branch (seems like a refactoring to better organize the code)
- Preserve the conditional rayon exports from HEAD

```rust
mod utils;

pub use format::{BinaryBytes, DecimalBytes, FormattedDuration, HumanBytes, HumanDuration};
pub use iter::{ProgressBarIter, ProgressIterator};
pub use progress::{
    MultiProgress, ProgressBar, ProgressBarRead, ProgressDrawTarget,
};
pub use style::ProgressStyle;

#[cfg(feature = "with_rayon")]
pub use iter::rayon::{ParProgressBarIter, ParallelProgressIterator};

```
