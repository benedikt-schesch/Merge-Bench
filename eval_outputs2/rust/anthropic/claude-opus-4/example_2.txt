Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- The HEAD branch adds a new method `as_text()` that converts the context to textual format
- The other branch (84a17829ad8fd425591d9f0cfd2ed89463bd757b) doesn't have this method

Since this appears to be a simple addition of a new method with no conflicting changes, the semantic intent is to add the `as_text()` method to the implementation. The conflict likely arose because both branches modified the same area of the file, but there's no actual semantic conflict here.

Here's the resolved version:

```rust

    #[allow(dead_code)]
    pub(crate) fn insert_summary(&self, _summary: &str) -> Context {
        todo!()
    }

    /// Converts the context to textual format
    pub fn as_text(&self) -> String {
        todo!()
    }
}

#[async_trait]
pub trait ContextRepository {
    /// Get the context for the current path

```
