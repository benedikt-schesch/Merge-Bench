Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to specify a trait bound for the generic type `S`, but they're using different ways to refer to the `Debug` trait:

- HEAD uses `fmt::Debug`
- The other branch uses just `Debug`

Both are referring to the same trait (`std::fmt::Debug`), just with different levels of qualification. The intent is the same - to require that `S` implements the `Debug` trait.

Since both achieve the same goal and this is just a stylistic difference, I'll resolve by keeping the more explicit `fmt::Debug` from HEAD as it's clearer about which module the trait comes from:

```rust
        variable_defs: HashMap::new(),
        current_scope: None,
    }
}

pub struct VariableInAllowedPosition<'a, S: fmt::Debug + 'a> {
    spreads: HashMap<Scope<'a>, HashSet<&'a str>>,
    variable_usages: HashMap<Scope<'a>, Vec<(Spanning<&'a String>, Type<'a>)>>,
    #[allow(clippy::type_complexity)]
    variable_defs: HashMap<Scope<'a>, Vec<&'a (Spanning<&'a str>, VariableDefinition<'a, S>)>>,
    current_scope: Option<Scope<'a>>,

```
