Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to add imports for `tokio::prelude::Future` and `tokio::runtime::TaskExecutor`, while the other branch (2cc67a0957b29b57e65c0234c31703b3868e29f7) has removed these imports.

The key observation is that there's already a `use std::future::Future;` import present in both versions. The `tokio::prelude::Future` import would conflict with this as it would import the same trait name `Future` from a different module.

Given that:
1. The more recent branch has removed the tokio imports
2. There's already a `std::future::Future` import that serves the same purpose
3. Modern Rust code typically uses `std::future::Future` rather than the older tokio-specific Future trait

The semantic intent appears to be moving away from tokio-specific imports to standard library imports. Therefore, the conflict should be resolved by accepting the version without the tokio imports.

```rust
use glfw::Context;
use parking_lot::Mutex;
use std::ffi::c_void;
use std::future::Future;
use std::sync::Arc;

pub(crate) struct GlfwFlutterEngineHandler {
    pub(crate) glfw: glfw::Glfw,
    pub(crate) window: Arc<Mutex<glfw::Window>>,
    pub(crate) resource_window: Arc<Mutex<glfw::Window>>,
