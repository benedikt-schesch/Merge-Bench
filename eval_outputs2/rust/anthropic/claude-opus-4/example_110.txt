Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to document the same struct `MultiProgress`. The only difference is:

- HEAD version: Has a period at the end of the doc comment and includes `#[derive(Debug)]`
- Other version: No period at the end of the doc comment and no `#[derive(Debug)]`

Since the HEAD version includes the `#[derive(Debug)]` attribute which is a functional addition (allowing the struct to be printed for debugging), and documentation style typically includes periods at the end of sentences, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```rust
    pub fn elapsed(&self) -> Duration {
        self.state.lock().unwrap().started.elapsed()
    }
}

/// Manages multiple progress bars from different threads.
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct MultiProgress {
    state: Arc<RwLock<MultiProgressState>>,
}

impl Default for MultiProgress {
```
