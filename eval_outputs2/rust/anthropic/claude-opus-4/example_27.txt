Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import items from the `std` library, but with different formatting and different imports:

- HEAD wants to import `path::Path` and `str::FromStr` in a single line
- The other branch wants to import `borrow::Cow` and `str::FromStr` on separate lines

Since both sides need `str::FromStr` and each side has unique imports that don't conflict with each other, the semantic intent is to have all three imports available. The best resolution is to combine them, following the multi-line style from the second branch for consistency:

```rust
use std::borrow::Cow;
use std::path::Path;
use std::str::FromStr;

use once_cell::sync::Lazy;
use regex::Regex;
use serde::{de, Deserialize, Deserializer, Serialize};
use tracing::warn;

```
