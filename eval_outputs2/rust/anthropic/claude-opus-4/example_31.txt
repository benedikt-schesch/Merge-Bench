Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle pattern matching on `PubGrubPackage` variants, but they have different approaches:

- HEAD: Only matches `PubGrubPackage::Package` with 4 parameters
- The incoming change: Matches both `PubGrubPackage::Extra` and `PubGrubPackage::Package` variants, each with 3 parameters

The semantic intent appears to be that the incoming change is expanding the pattern matching to handle both `Extra` and `Package` variants when the third parameter is `None`. Since both variants seem to need the same handling (they both proceed to wait for metadata), the incoming change makes sense semantically.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```rust
                }

                Ok(Some(ResolverVersion::Available(version.clone())))
            }

            PubGrubPackage::Extra(package_name, _, None)
            | PubGrubPackage::Package(package_name, _, None) => {
                // Wait for the metadata to be available.
                let versions_response = self
                    .index
                    .packages
                    .wait(package_name)

```
