Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch): Expects `T` to be a `Resource`
- Incoming change: Expects `T` to be a `Component`

This appears to be a conflict about what trait bound `T` should have for the `EventWriter` implementation. Without more context about the broader codebase changes, I cannot determine which constraint is semantically correct or if perhaps both traits should be required.

Since the intent is ambiguous and I cannot determine which trait bound is correct for this implementation, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
    events: ResMut<'w, Events<T>>,
    #[system_param(ignore)]
    marker: PhantomData<&'s usize>,
}

<<<<<<< HEAD

    pub fn send(&mut self, event: T) {
        self.events.send(event);
    }

    pub fn send_batch(&mut self, events: impl Iterator<Item = T>) {
