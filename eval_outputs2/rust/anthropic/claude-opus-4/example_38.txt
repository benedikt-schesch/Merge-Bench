Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to show the output of a `uv pip compile` command, but they have different results:

- HEAD side: Shows `jinja2==3.1.3` as the resolved package
- Other side: Shows `anyio==3.5.0` as the resolved package, and includes an additional `--exclude-newer` flag in the command

The conflict appears to be about which package should be shown in the test output. Since both sides agree that "Resolved 1 package" (as shown in stderr), and the semantic intent seems to be testing the `--no-deps` functionality rather than a specific package, I cannot determine which package is the correct one to use without more context about what `requirements.in` contains or what the test is specifically trying to verify.

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unresolved:

```rust
        .arg("--no-deps"), @r###"
    success: true
    exit_code: 0
