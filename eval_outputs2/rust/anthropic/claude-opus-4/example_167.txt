Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add methods to what appears to be a struct implementation. The conflict shows:

1. **HEAD** wants to add a method called `handle_ethereum_log`
2. **The other branch** wants to add two methods: `host_exports` and `handle_ethereum_event`

From the method signatures and parameters, it seems that `handle_ethereum_log` and `handle_ethereum_event` are likely referring to the same functionality - handling Ethereum logs/events (these terms are often used interchangeably in Ethereum contexts). The incoming branch also adds an additional `host_exports` getter method.

The semantic resolution should include both the `host_exports` method (which provides additional functionality) and use the more descriptive name `handle_ethereum_event` (which better reflects Ethereum's terminology).

```rust
        this.running_start = false;

        Ok(this)
    }

    pub(crate) fn host_exports(&self) -> &HostExports<T, L, S, U> {
        &self.valid_module.host_exports
    }

    pub(crate) fn handle_ethereum_event(
        mut self,
        handler_name: &str,
        transaction: Arc<Transaction>,
        log: Arc<Log>,
        params: Vec<LogParam>,
