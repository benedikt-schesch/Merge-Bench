Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to include necessary external crates and imports. The conflict appears to be about the order and inclusion of `extern crate` statements.

Let me analyze the intent:
- HEAD side: Has `extern crate user_lib;` followed by `extern crate alloc;` and another `extern crate user_lib;` (duplicate), then uses imports from `user_lib`
- Other side: Removes the first `extern crate user_lib;` but keeps `extern crate alloc;` and `extern crate user_lib;` in that order

The semantic intent seems to be:
1. Both sides want `extern crate alloc;` and `extern crate user_lib;`
2. The duplication of `extern crate user_lib;` in HEAD appears to be unintentional
3. Both sides want the `use` statement for imports from `user_lib`

The resolved version should have each `extern crate` declaration only once, in a logical order:

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

extern crate alloc;
extern crate user_lib;

use user_lib::{VIRTGPU_XRES, VIRTGPU_YRES, Display};

```
