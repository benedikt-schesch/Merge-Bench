Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle different variants of the `PubGrubPackage` enum in a match statement.

The key differences are:
1. The HEAD version has a `Package` variant with 4 parameters: `(name, _extra, None, _)`
2. The incoming change adds handling for an `Extra` variant and has a `Package` variant with only 3 parameters: `(name, _extra, None)`

Based on the pattern, it appears that:
- The incoming change added support for handling the `Extra` variant (which makes semantic sense as it follows the pattern of handling different package types)
- There's a discrepancy in the number of parameters for the `Package` variant

Since the HEAD version has 4 parameters and the incoming has 3, and both sides seem to want to handle the case where the third parameter is `None`, I'll preserve the HEAD's 4-parameter version while adding the `Extra` variant handling from the incoming change.

```rust
        request_sink: &tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender<Request>,
    ) -> Result<(), ResolveError> {
        match package {
            PubGrubPackage::Root(_) => {}
            PubGrubPackage::Python(_) => {}
            PubGrubPackage::Extra(_, _, _) => {}
            PubGrubPackage::Package(name, _extra, None, _) => {
                // Verify that the package is allowed under the hash-checking policy.
                if !self.hasher.allows_package(name) {
                    return Err(ResolveError::UnhashedPackage(name.clone()));
                }
