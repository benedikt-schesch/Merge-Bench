Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the method call to `draw_on_doc`, but with different parameters:

- HEAD version: `draw_on_doc(cx, engine_view)?`
- Incoming version: `draw_on_doc(cx, doc_bounds, camera)?`

To understand the intent, I can see that:
1. The HEAD version appears to be refactoring to use `engine_view` as a consolidated parameter
2. The incoming version is using `doc_bounds` and `camera` as separate parameters

Looking at the context, the `dragproximity_tool` in the HEAD version is already using the `engine_view` parameter pattern, suggesting this is the intended API change throughout the codebase.

The semantic intent appears to be standardizing the `draw_on_doc` method signature to use `engine_view` instead of separate `doc_bounds` and `camera` parameters.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
            }
            ToolsStyle::DragProximity => {
                self.dragproximity_tool.draw_on_doc(cx, engine_view)?;
            }
            ToolsStyle::OffsetCamera => {
                self.offsetcamera_tool.draw_on_doc(cx, engine_view)?;
            }
        }

        cx.restore().map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!("{}", e))?;
        Ok(())

```
