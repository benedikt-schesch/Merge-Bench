Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- The HEAD (current branch) wants to include two fields: `parent: None,` and `specifier: None,`
- The incoming branch (02345a5a7d7d86c96820e2c1a3d9dbf91d1ec538) wants to remove these two fields

Without more context about the broader changes in each branch, it's difficult to determine which approach is correct. The conflict could be due to:
1. The incoming branch intentionally removing these fields (perhaps they're no longer needed)
2. The HEAD branch adding these fields for new functionality
3. A refactoring where these fields were moved elsewhere

Since I cannot determine the correct intent without understanding the broader context of these changes, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
                                        extra: extra.cloned(),
                                        dev: None,
                                        marker,
                                    }),
                                    version: Range::singleton(version.clone()),
<<<<<<< HEAD
                                    parent: None,
                                    specifier: None,

                        })
                        .collect(),
                ));
