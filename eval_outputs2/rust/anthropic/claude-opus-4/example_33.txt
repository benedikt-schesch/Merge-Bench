No reasoning found</think>
Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch) includes a comment `# via -r requirements.in` after `jinja2==3.1.2`
- The incoming change (fab8d858b636fce9e841e0228a9ebd6b3ddcbe04) removes this comment

Given the context:
1. This is an autogenerated file by `uv pip compile`
2. The `markupsafe==2.1.5` entry below has a similar comment `# via jinja2`
3. These comments typically indicate the source/reason for including a package

The intent appears to be that the incoming change wants to remove the source comment for jinja2. Since this is an autogenerated file, the incoming change likely reflects the current output format of the `uv` tool, which may have changed to not include source comments for direct dependencies from requirements.in.

I'll resolve this by accepting the incoming change (removing the comment):

```rust
    exit_code: 0
    ----- stdout -----
    # This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
    #    uv pip compile requirements.in --cache-dir [CACHE_DIR]
    jinja2==3.1.2
    markupsafe==2.1.5
        # via jinja2

    ----- stderr -----
    Resolved 2 packages in [TIME]
