Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the documentation reference to the `add_plugins` method. The conflict is about how to format this reference:

- HEAD version: `[`add_plugins`](Self::add_plugins)`
- Other version: `[`App::add_plugins`]`

The HEAD version uses the more explicit link syntax with `(Self::add_plugins)` which creates a proper rustdoc link to the method on the current type. The other version uses just square brackets which is less explicit.

Since this is Rust documentation and the HEAD version provides a more complete and proper rustdoc link format, I'll resolve in favor of HEAD:

```rust
    /// Adds a single plugin
    ///
    /// One of Bevy's core principles is modularity. All Bevy engine features are implemented
    /// as plugins. This includes internal features like the renderer.
    ///
    /// Bevy also provides a few sets of default plugins. See [`add_plugins`](Self::add_plugins).
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// ```
    /// # use bevy_app::prelude::*;
    /// #
```
