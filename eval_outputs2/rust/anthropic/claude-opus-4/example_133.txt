Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to pass a source-related argument to the `generate_export_as_module_export` function, but with different approaches:

- HEAD is adding a new parameter `should_reexport_raw` and passing `Some(&source)`
- The other branch is passing `Some(&source.to_module_id()))`

Without more context about the function signature and the intent of both changes, I cannot determine which approach is correct or if both changes need to be combined. The conflict appears to involve both a potential API change (adding a new parameter) and a different way of handling the source parameter.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust

  for source in ordered_external_export {
    let export = &bundle_reference.external_export_map[source];

    patch_export_to_module.extend(generate_export_as_module_export(
<<<<<<< HEAD
      should_reexport_raw,
      Some(&source),
=======
      Some(&source.to_module_id()),
>>>>>>> 24a95b48172836d31c55697037d5dada7d9c1ef7
      export,
      bundle_variable,
      module_analyzer_manager,
      polyfill,
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
