Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import items from `gleam_core`, but with slightly different structures:

- **HEAD**: Imports `Result`, `build::Package`, `build::ProjectCompiler`, and `build::Target`
- **Other branch**: Imports `build::Options`, `build::Package`, `build::ProjectCompiler`, and `Result`

The key differences are:
1. HEAD includes `Target` but not `Options`
2. The other branch includes `Options` but not `Target`
3. The formatting style differs (single line vs multi-line)

Given that the function `main` takes `options: &Options` as a parameter, it's clear that `Options` is needed. Looking at the semantics, it appears both sides want to import the necessary types, and we should include all of them. I'll use the multi-line format from the other branch as it's more readable when there are multiple imports.

```rust
use std::time::Instant;

use gleam_core::{
    build::{Options, Package, ProjectCompiler, Target},
    Result,
};

use crate::{cli, fs};

pub fn main(options: &Options) -> Result<Package> {
    let manifest = crate::dependencies::download(None)?;

```
