Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch): Checks if `success_count + fail_count > 1`
- Incoming change: Checks if `success_count + fail_count > 0`

The conflict is about when to display the message about loaded/skipped paths. The HEAD version only shows the message when there are more than 1 total paths processed, while the incoming change shows the message when there is at least 1 path processed.

From a semantic perspective, the incoming change (`> 0`) makes more sense because:
1. It provides feedback even when processing a single path
2. Users would likely want to know the outcome even for a single file operation
3. The message format "X path(s) loaded, Y skipped" works grammatically for any value including 1

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
                    self.unimplemented();
                }

                match self.edit(paths) {
                    Ok((success_count, fail_count)) => {
                        if success_count + fail_count > 0 {
                            self.message(
                                format!(
                                    "{} path(s) loaded, {} skipped",
                                    success_count, fail_count
                                ),
```
