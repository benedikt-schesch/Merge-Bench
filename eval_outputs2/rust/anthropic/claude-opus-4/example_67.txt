Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD version: `init_info` is being called with 3 parameters - `&mut world.components` and `&mut world.storages`
- Other version: `init_info` is being called with 2 parameters - only `&mut world.components`

This appears to be a case where the API for `init_info` has changed. The HEAD version seems to be adding an additional parameter (`&mut world.storages`) to the method call.

Since the HEAD version includes the additional parameter that the other branch doesn't have, and given that this looks like an API evolution where `init_info` now requires access to `world.storages`, the correct resolution would be to use the HEAD version which includes all necessary parameters.

```rust
        world.flush();

        let (lower, upper) = iter.size_hint();
        let length = upper.unwrap_or(lower);

        let bundle_info = world
            .bundles
            .init_info::<I::Item>(&mut world.components, &mut world.storages);
        world.entities.reserve(length as u32);
        let mut spawner = bundle_info.get_bundle_spawner(
            &mut world.entities,
            &mut world.archetypes,
            &mut world.components,

```
