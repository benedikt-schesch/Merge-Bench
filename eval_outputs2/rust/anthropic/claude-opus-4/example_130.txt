Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to set the `output_file` field, but there's a duplication issue.

In the HEAD version:
- `output_file: Some(format_output_name(name))` is already set on line 4
- It uses `..Default::default()` to fill in any remaining fields

In the incoming change:
- It tries to add `output_file: Some(format_output_name(name))` again, which would be a duplicate

Since both sides want the same `output_file` value and it's already present before the conflict, the resolution should keep the HEAD version which avoids duplication and uses the spread operator for remaining fields.

```rust
      &compiler,
      AssertCompilerResultConfig {
        entry_name: Some(entry_name.clone()),
        output_file: Some(format_output_name(name)),
        ignore_emitted_field: false,
        ..Default::default()
      },
    );
  }
}
