Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to pass arguments to what appears to be a function call. The conflict shows:

- HEAD (current branch) is passing two `None` values
- The incoming branch (e6e89b04147f8ce611e5ffb5b142225e081e7caa) is passing `package.readme_source`

Based on the context and the semantic intent, it appears that:
1. The function signature was likely modified to accept additional parameters
2. The incoming branch has `package.readme_source` which seems to be a meaningful value that should be preserved
3. The HEAD branch might have been using `None` as placeholders or defaults

The most sensible resolution would be to keep the `package.readme_source` from the incoming branch and add `None` for any additional parameter that HEAD was trying to add. This preserves the meaningful data while accommodating the function signature change.

```rust
    version_or_latest == VersionOrLatest::Latest,
    repo,
    readme,
    package.runtime_compat,
    registry_url,
    package.readme_source,
    None,
  )
  .map_err(|e| {
    error!("failed to generate docs: {}", e);
    ApiError::InternalServerError
  })?
```
