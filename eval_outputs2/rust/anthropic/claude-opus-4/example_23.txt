Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to implement the `hashbrown::Equivalent` trait, but for different types:

- HEAD: Implements `Equivalent<ConflictKind>` for `ConflictKindRef<'a>`
- Other branch: Implements `Equivalent<ConflictPackage>` for `ConflictPackageRef<'_>`

The conflict appears to be caused by a refactoring where `ConflictKind` was renamed to `ConflictPackage` (and correspondingly `ConflictKindRef` to `ConflictPackageRef`).

Looking at the context, the `eq` method above the conflict is still using the old naming (`ConflictKindRef`), which suggests the refactoring on the other branch is incomplete or this is a different part of the codebase.

Since I cannot determine with certainty which naming is correct or if both implementations should exist, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
    fn eq(&self, other: &ConflictKindRef<'a>) -> bool {
        self.as_ref() == *other
    }
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
impl<'a> hashbrown::Equivalent<ConflictKind> for ConflictKindRef<'a> {
    fn equivalent(&self, key: &ConflictKind) -> bool {
=======
impl hashbrown::Equivalent<ConflictPackage> for ConflictPackageRef<'_> {
    fn equivalent(&self, key: &ConflictPackage) -> bool {
>>>>>>> 02345a5a7d7d86c96820e2c1a3d9dbf91d1ec538
        key.as_ref() == *self
    }
}

/// An error that occurs when the given conflicting set is invalid somehow.
