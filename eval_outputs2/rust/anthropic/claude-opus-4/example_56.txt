Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

1. **HEAD** (current branch): `world.spawn().insert(Foo(0.0f32));`
   - Spawns an entity with a `Foo` component containing a `0.0f32` value
   - The `removal` system appears to be removing `<Foo>` components

2. **Incoming changes**: `world.spawn().insert(0.0f32);`
   - Spawns an entity with just a raw `f32` value
   - This would not match the `Foo` type being removed in the system

Given that:
- The removal system specifically removes `<Foo>` components
- The test appears to be testing the removal functionality
- The HEAD version uses `Foo(0.0f32)` which matches the type being removed

The semantic intent appears to be testing the removal of `Foo` components. The HEAD version is correct because it inserts the proper `Foo` type that the removal system expects.

```rust
                commands.entity(entity).remove::<Foo>();
            }
        }

        let mut stage = SystemStage::parallel().with_system(removal);
        world.spawn().insert(Foo(0.0f32));
        world.insert_resource(0usize);
        stage.run(&mut world);
        stage.run(&mut world);
        assert_eq!(*world.get_resource::<usize>().unwrap(), 1);
