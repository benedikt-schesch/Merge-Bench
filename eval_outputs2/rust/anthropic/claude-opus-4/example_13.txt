Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

**HEAD (left side)**: 
- Creates a `PipelineStatePropagator` with the plan
- Calls `transform_up` on the pipeline object
- Extracts the plan from the resulting state data
- Returns the processed plan

**Incoming changes (right side)**:
- Directly calls `transform_up` on the plan
- Returns the result directly

The semantic intent appears to be that HEAD introduced a new abstraction layer (`PipelineStatePropagator`) for handling the transformation, while the incoming changes use the direct approach. Since HEAD seems to be a more recent refactoring that wraps the transformation in a pipeline state propagator (likely for additional state management capabilities), I'll resolve in favor of HEAD's approach as it appears to be the intended architecture moving forward.

```rust
    fn optimize(
        &self,
        plan: Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>,
        config: &ConfigOptions,
    ) -> Result<Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>> {
        let pipeline = PipelineStatePropagator::new_default(plan);
        let state = pipeline
            .transform_up(&|p| check_finiteness_requirements(p, &config.optimizer))?
            .data;
        Ok(state.plan)
    }

    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "PipelineChecker"
    }

```
