Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD version is setting all fields to their default values using `::default()`
- The incoming change (2b8248e60f) is using the `smooth_options` and `rough_options` variables that were defined above the struct initialization

Since the code above the conflict shows that `rough_options.stroke_width` was being modified before the struct initialization, it appears the intent of the incoming change is to use these pre-configured option objects rather than just using defaults.

The HEAD version adds a `constraint` field that isn't present in the incoming change, which suggests this field was added in a separate development branch.

To resolve this semantically, we should:
1. Use the pre-configured `smooth_options` and `rough_options` from the incoming change (since they may have been modified)
2. Keep the `constraint` field from HEAD (since it's a new addition)

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
        rough_options.stroke_width = Self::STROKE_WIDTH_DEFAULT;

        Self {
            builder_type: ShapeBuilderType::default(),
            style: ShaperStyle::default(),
            smooth_options,
            rough_options,
            constraint: Constraint::default(),
            state: ShaperState::Idle,
        }
    }
}
