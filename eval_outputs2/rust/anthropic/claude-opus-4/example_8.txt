Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import items from `datafusion_common`. The HEAD branch is importing `tree_node::{Transformed, TransformedResult}` while the other branch removed that import but kept other imports from `datafusion_common`.

Since both branches have another `use datafusion_common` statement below that imports from `cast` and `tree_node`, it appears the intent is to consolidate the imports. The conflict seems to be about whether to include `Transformed` and `TransformedResult` in the imports.

Given that the second `use datafusion_common` statement already imports from `tree_node` (specifically `TreeNode` and `TreeNodeRewriter`), it would make sense to consolidate all `tree_node` imports together and remove the duplicate `use datafusion_common` statement.

Here's the resolved version:

```rust
use arrow::{
    array::{new_null_array, AsArray},
    datatypes::{DataType, Field, Schema},
    record_batch::RecordBatch,
};
use datafusion_common::{
    cast::{as_large_list_array, as_list_array},
    tree_node::{Transformed, TransformedResult, TreeNode, TreeNodeRewriter},
};
use datafusion_common::{

```
