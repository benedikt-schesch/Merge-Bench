Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - they're both constraining the generic type `S` to implement the `Debug` trait. The only difference is:

- HEAD uses `fmt::Debug` (fully qualified path)
- The incoming change uses just `Debug` (assuming `Debug` is in scope)

Since both refer to the same trait (`std::fmt::Debug`), and the shorter form `Debug` appears to be the preferred style in this codebase (as evidenced by the incoming change), I'll resolve this by using the simpler `Debug` bound.

```rust
    #[allow(clippy::type_complexity)]
    variable_defs: HashMap<Scope<'a>, Vec<&'a (Spanning<&'a str>, VariableDefinition<'a, S>)>>,
    current_scope: Option<Scope<'a>>,
}

impl<'a, S: Debug> VariableInAllowedPosition<'a, S> {
    fn collect_incorrect_usages<'me>(
        &'me self,
        from: &Scope<'a>,
        var_defs: &[&'a (Spanning<&'a str>, VariableDefinition<S>)],
        ctx: &mut ValidatorContext<'a, S>,
```
