Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call `simpl_power` but with slightly different approaches:

- HEAD: Uses `Transformed::yes(simpl_power(args, <&S>::clone(&info))?)` - explicitly wrapping the result in `Transformed::yes()` and cloning the info reference
- The other branch: Uses `simpl_power(args, info)?` - directly returning the result from `simpl_power`

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both want to simplify the power function. The difference is in the return type handling. Based on the pattern and the fact that the other branch's approach is simpler and likely means `simpl_power` already returns a `Transformed` type, I'll resolve this by using the cleaner approach:

```rust

            // power
            Expr::ScalarFunction(ScalarFunction {
                func_def: ScalarFunctionDefinition::BuiltIn(BuiltinScalarFunction::Power),
                args,
            }) => simpl_power(args, info)?,

            // concat
            Expr::ScalarFunction(ScalarFunction {
                func_def: ScalarFunctionDefinition::BuiltIn(BuiltinScalarFunction::Concat),
                args,

```
