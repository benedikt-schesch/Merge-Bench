Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import items from `datafusion_common::tree_node` and `datafusion_common`, but with some differences:

- HEAD imports: `TreeNode`, `TreeNodeRecursion` from `tree_node` and `plan_err`, `DataFusionError`, `Result` from `datafusion_common`
- The other branch imports: `TreeNode`, `VisitRecursion` from `tree_node` and `plan_err`, `Result` from `datafusion_common`

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want `TreeNode`, `plan_err`, and `Result`
- HEAD wants `TreeNodeRecursion` and `DataFusionError`
- The other branch wants `VisitRecursion` instead of `TreeNodeRecursion`

Based on typical refactoring patterns, it seems like `TreeNodeRecursion` might have been renamed to `VisitRecursion` in the other branch. The safe resolution would be to include all the imports that either side needs, which means including both recursion types (in case they're actually different) and keeping `DataFusionError` since HEAD needs it.
