Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is adding imports and a component struct definition that the other branch doesn't have. The conflict appears to be about what imports and definitions should be included in the test module.

Based on the semantic intent:
- HEAD wants to add more imports (including `bevy_ecs`, `Component`, and `Storages`) and define a generic component struct `W<T>`
- The other branch has a minimal set of imports

Since this is a test module and HEAD appears to be adding test infrastructure (the `W<T>` component), I'll resolve by keeping HEAD's additions as they seem necessary for the tests:

```rust
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate as bevy_ecs;
    use crate::component::Component;
    use crate::storage::Storages;
    use crate::{component::Components, entity::Entity, storage::Table};
    #[derive(Component)]
    struct W<T>(T);

    #[test]
    fn table() {
        let mut components = Components::default();

```
