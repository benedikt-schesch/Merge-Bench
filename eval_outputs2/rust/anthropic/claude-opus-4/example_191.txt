Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different imports to the existing `use` statements:

- HEAD wants to import `fs::File` and `path` from `std`
- The other branch wants to import `thread` and `time` from `std`

Since these are non-conflicting imports that likely serve different purposes in the test, and both are probably needed for the complete functionality, I'll merge them together:

```rust
use assert_cmd::Command;
use std::io::Write;
use std::{fs::File, path, thread, time};
use tempfile::tempdir;

#[test]
fn test_killport() {
    // Create a temporary directory for testing.

```
