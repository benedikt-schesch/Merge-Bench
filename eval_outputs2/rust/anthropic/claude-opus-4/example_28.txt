Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import similar items but with some differences:

- HEAD includes `parse_pep508_requirement`, `TrackedFromStr`, and `UnnamedRequirement` in the main import
- The other branch separates `UnnamedRequirement` into its own import from `crate::unnamed`

Both sides keep the same items except for `TrackedFromStr` (only in HEAD) and the location of `UnnamedRequirement`. Since the function `parse_pepe508_err` uses `parse_pep508_requirement`, that import is definitely needed.

The semantic intent appears to be reorganizing imports, with the other branch moving `UnnamedRequirement` to a separate module. I'll resolve by keeping the separate import structure from the other branch while including all necessary items:

```rust

    use crate::marker::{
        parse_markers_impl, MarkerExpression, MarkerOperator, MarkerTree, MarkerValue,
        MarkerValueString, MarkerValueVersion,
    };
    use crate::unnamed::UnnamedRequirement;
    use crate::{
        parse_pep508_requirement, Cursor, Pep508Error, Requirement, TrackedFromStr, VerbatimUrl,
        VersionOrUrl,
    };

    fn parse_pepe508_err(input: &str) -> String {
        parse_pep508_requirement(&mut Cursor::new(&input), None, None)
            .unwrap_err()
            .to_string()

```
