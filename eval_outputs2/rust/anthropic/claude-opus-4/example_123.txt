Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to set virtual terminal settings, but with different approaches:

- HEAD (current branch): Uses conditional compilation to only run this on Windows with `#[cfg(windows)]`
- The incoming branch: Runs the code unconditionally on all platforms

Based on the semantics and the fact that this appears to be setting up virtual terminal support (which is typically a Windows-specific concern for enabling ANSI escape codes), the HEAD version with the `#[cfg(windows)]` conditional compilation is likely the correct approach. This prevents unnecessary operations on non-Windows platforms where virtual terminal support is typically already available.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
    });
}

impl Repl {
    fn new(ide_mode: bool) -> Result<Repl, Error> {
        #[cfg(windows)]
        let _ret = control::set_virtual_terminal(true);

        let (command_context, outputs) = CommandContext::new()?;
        send_output(outputs.stdout, io::stdout(), None);
        send_output(outputs.stderr, io::stderr(), Some(Color::BrightRed));
        let mut repl = Repl {
            command_context,

```
