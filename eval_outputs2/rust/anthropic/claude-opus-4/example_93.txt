Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call `init_info::<T>()` but with different parameters:

- HEAD version: passes both `&mut self.world.components` and `&mut self.world.storages`
- Other version: only passes `&mut self.world.components`

Given that the code after the conflict shows `bundle_info.get_bundle_inserter()` is called with both `components` and `storages` as parameters, and considering that the HEAD version includes `storages` in the `init_info` call, it appears the HEAD version is more complete and aligned with the overall pattern of the code.

The semantic intent seems to be initializing bundle information with all necessary world state, including both components and storages.

```rust
    pub fn insert_bundle<T: Bundle>(&mut self, bundle: T) -> &mut Self {
        let change_tick = self.world.change_tick();
        let bundle_info = self
            .world
            .bundles
            .init_info::<T>(&mut self.world.components, &mut self.world.storages);
        let mut bundle_inserter = bundle_info.get_bundle_inserter(
            &mut self.world.entities,
            &mut self.world.archetypes,
            &mut self.world.components,
            &mut self.world.storages,
