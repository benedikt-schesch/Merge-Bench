Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call `get_or_download_idl` but with different parameters:

- HEAD version: Added an `ignore_unused` field to the `LocalIdl` struct and calls `get_or_download_idl(idl)?`
- The other branch: Calls `get_or_download_idl(idl, &*DEFAULT_DIR)?` without the `ignore_unused` field

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. HEAD wants to support an `ignore_unused` field in the `LocalIdl` struct
2. The other branch wants to pass a default directory parameter to `get_or_download_idl`

The proper resolution should include both changes - the `ignore_unused` field from HEAD and the additional `&*DEFAULT_DIR` parameter from the other branch:

```rust
            for idl in entry.idls {
                let LocalIdl {
                    path,
                    includes,
                    touch,
                    ignore_unused,
                } = get_or_download_idl(idl, &*DEFAULT_DIR)?;

                builder = builder
                    .add_service(path.clone())
                    .includes(includes)
                    .touch([(path, touch)])

```
