Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same `spawn` method, but with different lifetime parameter orderings in the return type `EntityCommands`.

- HEAD version: `EntityCommands<'w, 's, '_>`
- Other version: `EntityCommands<'s, 'w, '_>`

The only difference is the order of lifetime parameters `'w` and `'s`. Without additional context about which ordering is correct or what these lifetimes represent, I cannot determine which version should be kept. This appears to be a case where the correct resolution depends on the broader codebase conventions or API requirements.

Since I cannot determine the correct intent, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
        let e = self.commands.spawn_bundle(bundle);
        self.push_children.children.push(e.id());
        e
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
    pub fn spawn(&mut self) -> EntityCommands<'w, 's, '_> {
=======
    pub fn spawn(&mut self) -> EntityCommands<'s, 'w, '_> {
>>>>>>> 65e834ce8d5142f1a01d06c2a9e4e7ef4a1238a9
        let e = self.commands.spawn();
        self.push_children.children.push(e.id());
        e
    }
