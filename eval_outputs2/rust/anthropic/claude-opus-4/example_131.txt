Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the `FARM_CACHE_VERSION` constant, but with different version numbers:
- HEAD (current branch): "0.6.0"
- Incoming change: "0.4.10"

Since version "0.6.0" is higher than "0.4.10", and in typical version update scenarios we want to keep the higher/newer version, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version.

```rust

use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

use crate::config::Mode;

const FARM_CACHE_VERSION: &str = "0.6.0";
const FARM_CACHE_MANIFEST_FILE: &str = "farm-cache.json";

// TODO make CacheStore a trait and implement DiskCacheStore or RemoteCacheStore or more.
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct CacheStore {

```
