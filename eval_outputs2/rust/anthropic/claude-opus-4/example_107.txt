Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to log information about dropping a table, but with slightly different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Uses `vnode_id` variable and calculates the number of fields as `column_ids.len() * series_ids.len()`
- **Other branch**: Uses `self.id` for the vnode ID and uses `field_ids.len()` for the field count

The semantic intent appears to be logging the vnode ID and the number of fields being deleted. The key differences are:
1. How the vnode ID is referenced (`vnode_id` vs `self.id`)
2. How the field count is calculated (`column_ids.len() * series_ids.len()` vs `field_ids.len()`)

Without more context about which variable names are correct in the current codebase, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The calculation method for fields also differs significantly, which could indicate different semantic meanings.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
                .write()
                .await
                .delete_series(&series_ids, &TimeRange::all());

            info!(
<<<<<<< HEAD
                "Drop table: vnode {vnode_id} deleting {} fields in table: {db_owner}.{table}",
                column_ids.len() * series_ids.len()
=======
                "Drop table: vnode {} deleting {} fields in table: {db_owner}.{table}",
                self.id,
                field_ids.len()
>>>>>>> 2f331dd42f24346ec0a861efbef3fcaed9e440f7
            );

            let version = self.ts_family.read().await.super_version();
            version
                .add_tombstone(&series_ids, &column_ids, &TimeRange::all())
```
