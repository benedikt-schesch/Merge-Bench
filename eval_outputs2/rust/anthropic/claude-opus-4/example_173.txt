Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD is adding `Random` to what appears to be an enum of operations
- The other branch (403680f17) is adding `Quantized` to the same enum

Both changes seem to be adding new operation types to the enum, and there's no semantic conflict between having both a `Random` operation and a `Quantized` operation. They appear to be independent additions that can coexist.

The resolution is to include both additions:

```rust
    Ternary,
    Cast,
    Reduce,
    Mfa,
    Conv,
    Random,
    Quantized,
}

macro_rules! ops{
    ($($name:ident),+) => {


```
