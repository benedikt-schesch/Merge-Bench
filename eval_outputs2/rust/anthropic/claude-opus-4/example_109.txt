Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- The HEAD side is adding `use anyhow::Result;`
- The other side (f5ff96f927ab1d6309becbbf27f62c2a15eb8cae) is removing or not including this import

Since this is a semantic merge conflict resolution, I need to consider whether the `Result` type from `anyhow` is actually being used in this file. Without seeing the rest of the file, I cannot determine if this import is necessary or not. The conflict appears to be about whether to include this dependency.

Given the ambiguity about whether `Result` is actually used in the code and the lack of context to make an informed decision about the intent, I should return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
//! Analysis for finding expected vs actual permission on path usage.
mod path_visitor;

<<<<<<< HEAD
use anyhow::Result;
=======
>>>>>>> f5ff96f927ab1d6309becbbf27f62c2a15eb8cae
use either::Either;
use flowistry::mir::utils::{OperandExt, SpanExt};
use path_visitor::get_path_boundaries;
use rustc_hir::HirId;
use rustc_middle::mir::{Rvalue, Statement, StatementKind};

```
