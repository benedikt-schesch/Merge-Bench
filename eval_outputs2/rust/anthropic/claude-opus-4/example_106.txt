Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import items from the same modules but with different selections:

- **HEAD** wants: `ColumnId, SeriesId, SeriesKey, TagKey, TagValue` from models, and `raft_write_command, WritePointsResponse` from protos::kv_service, plus `protos::models as fb_models`
- **Branch 2f331dd** wants: `ColumnId, SeriesId, SeriesKey` from models (subset of HEAD), `models::utils::unite_id`, and everything (`*`) from protos::kv_service

The semantic intent seems to be:
1. Both sides need the core types (ColumnId, SeriesId, SeriesKey)
2. HEAD needs additional specific types (TagKey, TagValue) and specific imports from kv_service
3. The branch needs unite_id utility and wants all kv_service imports

Since HEAD is more specific about what it needs from kv_service and the branch uses a wildcard import (which would include everything HEAD needs), and both sides seem to have valid requirements, the resolution should include all the specific imports needed:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

use models::meta_data::VnodeId;
use models::predicate::domain::{ResolvedPredicate, TimeRange, TimeRanges};
use models::schema::Precision;
use models::utils::unite_id;
use models::{ColumnId, SeriesId, SeriesKey, TagKey, TagValue};
use protos::kv_service::{raft_write_command, WritePointsResponse};
use protos::models as fb_models;
use snafu::ResultExt;
use tokio::sync::RwLock;
use trace::{debug, error, info, warn, SpanContext, SpanExt, SpanRecorder};

use crate::database::Database;

```
