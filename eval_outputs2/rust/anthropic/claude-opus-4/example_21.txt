Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

**HEAD (current branch):**
- Names the enum `ConflictKind`
- Includes three variants: `Extra`, `Group`, and `Project`
- Has `schemars::JsonSchema` derive
- Comment mentions "either an extra or a group name, or the entire project itself"

**Incoming change:**
- Names the enum `ConflictPackage`
- Only includes two variants: `Extra` and `Group`
- No `schemars::JsonSchema` derive
- Comment mentions only "either an extra or a group name"

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants to expand the concept to include the project itself as a conflict type
- HEAD also needs JSON schema support
- The incoming change has a different name preference

Given that HEAD has a superset of functionality (includes all variants from the incoming change plus `Project`, and has the additional derive), and both sides are trying to represent types of conflicts, I'll resolve by keeping HEAD's implementation but considering if the name `ConflictPackage` might be more descriptive. However, since `ConflictKind` accurately describes that this is the "kind" of conflict and the comment in HEAD matches the implementation, I'll keep the HEAD version entirely.

```rust
    }
}

/// The actual conflicting data for a package.
///
/// That is, either an extra or a group name, or the entire project itself.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Eq, Hash, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Ord, schemars::JsonSchema)]
pub enum ConflictKind {
    Extra(ExtraName),
    Group(GroupName),
    Project,
}
