Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import items from `datafusion_common::tree_node`, but with different types:

- HEAD wants: `TreeNode, TreeNodeRecursion`
- The incoming change wants: `TreeNode, VisitRecursion`

Additionally, the incoming change adds an import for `datafusion_common::instant::Instant`.

Based on the semantic intent, it appears that `TreeNodeRecursion` and `VisitRecursion` might be related types (possibly one was renamed to the other). Since both sides want `TreeNode` and only differ on the recursion type, and the incoming change also adds the `Instant` import, the most likely resolution is to keep both the `Instant` import and figure out which recursion type is correct.

Without more context about which is the correct recursion type to use, I'll preserve the conflict as requested:

```rust

use crate::analyzer::subquery::check_subquery_expr;
use crate::analyzer::type_coercion::TypeCoercion;
use crate::utils::log_plan;
use datafusion_common::config::ConfigOptions;
<<<<<<< HEAD
