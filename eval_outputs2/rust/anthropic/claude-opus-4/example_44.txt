Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- The HEAD version uses `T: StateData` as the trait bound
- The incoming change uses `T: Component + Debug + Clone + Eq + Hash` as the trait bounds

This appears to be a refactoring where `StateData` trait is being replaced with a combination of more granular trait bounds. The semantic intent is the same - to constrain the type `T` to have the necessary properties for use as state data. The incoming change is likely breaking down the `StateData` trait into its constituent required traits.

Since both sides have the same intent but the incoming change represents a more explicit/granular approach (possibly removing the `StateData` trait altogether from the codebase), I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```rust
    /// Each stage that uses `State<T>` for system run criteria needs a driver. If you need to use
    /// your state in more than one stage, consider manually adding [State::get_driver] to the
    /// stages you need it in.
    pub fn add_state_to_stage<T>(&mut self, stage: impl StageLabel, initial: T) -> &mut Self
    where
        T: Component + Debug + Clone + Eq + Hash,
    {
        self.insert_resource(State::new(initial))
            .add_system_set_to_stage(stage, State::<T>::get_driver())
    }


```
