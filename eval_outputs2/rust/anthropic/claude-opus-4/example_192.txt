Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import modules, with some overlap:

- HEAD imports: `log::{debug, info, warn}`
- The other branch imports: `crate::KillPortSignalOptions`, `bollard` modules, and `log::{debug, info}`

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides need logging functionality (`debug` and `info` from `log`)
2. HEAD additionally needs `warn` from `log`
3. The other branch needs additional imports for Docker-related functionality

Since both sides have valid imports that serve different purposes, the resolution should include all unique imports:

```rust
use crate::KillPortSignalOptions;

use bollard::container::{KillContainerOptions, ListContainersOptions};
use bollard::Docker;
use log::{debug, info, warn};
use nix::sys::signal::{kill, Signal};
use nix::unistd::Pid;
use procfs::process::FDTarget;
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::io;
```
