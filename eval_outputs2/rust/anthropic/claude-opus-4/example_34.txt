Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch) wants to include a comment `# via -r requirements.in` after `jinja2==3.1.3`
- The incoming branch (fab8d858...) wants to remove that comment entirely

This appears to be a conflict about whether to include source attribution comments in the pip requirements output. Since this is an autogenerated file (as noted in the header comment), and the comment provides useful information about where the requirement comes from, it makes sense to keep it.

The HEAD version preserves traceability by showing that jinja2 was specified in requirements.in, which is valuable for understanding the dependency tree.

```rust
    exit_code: 0
    ----- stdout -----

        # via -r requirements.in
