Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar goals with some differences:

1. **HEAD**: Adds a comment explaining that the code will "Pass incoming triggers to the WASM module and return entity changes; Stop when cancelled."

2. **Incoming change**: 
   - Wraps `valid_module` in an `Arc` (for shared ownership across threads)
   - Adds a similar but slightly different comment: "Pass incoming events to the WASM module and send entity changes back; stop when cancelled from the outside."

The semantic intent is the same - both are documenting what the subsequent code does. The incoming change also adds the Arc wrapper which seems important for thread safety.

Here's the resolved conflict that combines both intents:

```rust
                link_resolver: link_resolver.clone(),
                store: store.clone(),
            };
            let valid_module = ValidModule::new(&module_logger, wasmi_config, task_sender)
                .expect("Failed to validate module");
            let valid_module = Arc::new(valid_module);

            // Pass incoming triggers to the WASM module and return entity changes;
            // stop when cancelled from the outside.
            let canceler = cancel_receiver.into_stream();
            mapping_request_receiver
                .select(canceler.map(|_| panic!("WASM module thread cancelled")).map_err(|_| ()))
                .map_err(|()| err_msg("Cancelled"))
                .for_each(move |request: MappingRequest| -> Result<(), Error> {

```
