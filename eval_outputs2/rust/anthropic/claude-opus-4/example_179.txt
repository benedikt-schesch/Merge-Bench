Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to fix what appears to be a typo in the documentation comment. 

The conflict is between:
- HEAD: `/// Cnd is a way to tell the Runtime that something needs to be executed`
- Incoming: `/// Cmd is a way to tell the Runtime that something needs to be executed`

Given that the struct is named `Cmd<MSG>`, the incoming change (`Cmd`) is semantically correct - it's fixing the typo from "Cnd" to "Cmd" to match the actual struct name.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
use std::future::Future;
use std::pin::Pin;
#[cfg(feature = "with-dom")]
use wasm_bindgen::closure::Closure;

/// Cmd is a way to tell the Runtime that something needs to be executed
pub struct Cmd<MSG> {
    /// commands
    pub(crate) commands: Vec<Command<MSG>>,
}


```
