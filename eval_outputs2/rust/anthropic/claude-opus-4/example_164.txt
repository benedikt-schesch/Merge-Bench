Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same environment variable constant but with different names:

- HEAD wants: `GRAPH_MAPPING_HANDLER_TIMEOUT`
- The incoming change wants: `GRAPH_EVENT_HANDLER_TIMEOUT` and also adds an import for `WasmiModule`

Without more context about the project's architecture and naming conventions, I cannot definitively determine which name is correct or if both should coexist. The semantic intent appears to be defining a timeout environment variable for some kind of handler, but the specific handler type (mapping vs event) is ambiguous.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```rust
use std::fmt;
use std::ops::Deref;
use std::str::FromStr;
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

<<<<<<< HEAD
pub(crate) const TIMEOUT_ENV_VAR: &str = "GRAPH_MAPPING_HANDLER_TIMEOUT";
=======
use crate::module::WasmiModule;
