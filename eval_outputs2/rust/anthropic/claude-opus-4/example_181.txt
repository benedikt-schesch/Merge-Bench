Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they both want to have the same `if let` statement that destructures the tuple of `(patch_tag, target_tag)`.

The only difference between the two versions is:
- HEAD: Has no empty line before the `if let` statement and has a space after `=` but before `(`
- The other branch: Has an empty line before the `if let` statement and has proper spacing around the `=`

Since both sides have the same semantic intent and the second version has better formatting (proper spacing around the `=` operator and includes a blank line for readability), I'll resolve this by choosing the better-formatted version:

```rust
        let dom_patches:Vec<DomPatch> = patches.iter().map(|patch|{
            let patch_path = patch.path();
            let patch_tag = patch.tag();
            if let Some(target_node) = nodes_lookup.get(patch_path) {
                let target_tag = target_node.tag();

                if let (Some(patch_tag), Some(target_tag)) = (patch_tag, target_tag) {
                    if **patch_tag != target_tag{
                        panic!(
                            "expecting a tag: {patch_tag:?}, but found: {target_tag:?}"
                        );
                    }

```
