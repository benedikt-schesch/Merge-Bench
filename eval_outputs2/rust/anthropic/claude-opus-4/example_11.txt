Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - applying subrules to transform a plan. The key difference is:

- HEAD: Uses `pipeline` as the variable name and extracts `.data` from the result
- The other branch: Uses `plan` as the variable name and stores the full result as `new_plan`

Based on the context and the fact that the HEAD version extracts `.data`, it appears the correct resolution should use the `pipeline` variable name (to be consistent with the comment above mentioning "pipeline") and extract the data field from the transformation result.

Here's the resolved code:

```rust
        // of the current [`ExecutionPlan`] as we traverse the plan tree.
        let subrules: Vec<Box<PipelineFixerSubrule>> = vec![
            Box::new(hash_join_convert_symmetric_subrule),
            Box::new(hash_join_swap_subrule),
        ];
        let state = pipeline
            .transform_up(&|p| apply_subrules(p, &subrules, config))?
            .data;
        // Next, we apply another subrule that tries to optimize joins using any
        // statistics their inputs might have.
        // - For a hash join with partition mode [`PartitionMode::Auto`], we will
        //   make a cost-based decision to select which `PartitionMode` mode
        //   (`Partitioned`/`CollectLeft`) is optimal. If the statistics information
