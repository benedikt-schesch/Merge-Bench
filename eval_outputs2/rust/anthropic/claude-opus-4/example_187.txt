Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import similar modules but with slightly different selections:

- HEAD imports: `calculate_eos_tokens`, `convert_ggml_to_hf_tokenizer`, and `Cache`
- The other branch imports: `calculate_eos_tokens`, `GenerationConfig`, `get_chat_template`, and `Cache`

Both sides want `calculate_eos_tokens` and `Cache`, but they differ on the other imports. Since this appears to be a semantic merge where both sides are adding necessary imports for their respective features, the resolution should include all unique imports from both sides.

```rust
    ModelKind, ModelPaths, Pipeline, TokenSource, XLoraPaths,
};
use crate::aici::bintokens::build_tok_trie;
use crate::aici::toktree::TokTrie;
use crate::lora::Ordering;
use crate::pipeline::chat_template::{calculate_eos_tokens, GenerationConfig};
use crate::pipeline::gguf_tokenizer::convert_ggml_to_hf_tokenizer;
use crate::pipeline::{get_chat_template, Cache};
use crate::pipeline::{ChatTemplate, LocalModelPaths};
use crate::prefix_cacher::PrefixCacheManager;
use crate::sequence::Sequence;
use crate::utils::varbuilder_utils::{from_mmaped_safetensors, load_preload_adapters};
use crate::xlora_models::NonGranularState;

```
