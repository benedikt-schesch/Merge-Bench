Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to pass `task_identity` to the `TaskContext::new` constructor, but with different approaches:

- HEAD: passes `task_identity.to_string()` - converting to String
- The other branch: passes `Some(task_identity.clone())` - wrapping in Option

The semantic intent appears to be that the API changed to accept an `Option<String>` instead of just a `String`. The resolution should combine both changes: convert to String AND wrap in Option.

```rust
        }

        let session_id = task.session_id;
        let runtime = self.executor.runtime.clone();
        let task_context = Arc::new(TaskContext::new(
            Some(task_identity.to_string()),
            session_id,
            session_config,
            task_scalar_functions,
            task_aggregate_functions,
            runtime.clone(),

```
