Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the `update_current_playback_state` method, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD** (left side): Makes the function `async` and uses `await` for the asynchronous call to `get_current_playback()`, and uses `std::time::Instant::now()`
- **Right side**: Keeps the function synchronous (no `async`), calls `get_current_playback()` without `await`, and uses `std::time::SystemTime::now()`

The semantic intent appears to be that HEAD is converting the codebase to use async/await patterns, while the right side made a change to use `SystemTime` instead of `Instant`. 

Since the HEAD version is making the function async (which is likely a broader architectural change), and `Instant` is typically preferred for measuring elapsed time (which seems to be the purpose given the field name `playback_last_updated`), the HEAD version should be kept:

```rust
            None => Err(anyhow!("failed to get the current playback context")),
        }
    }

    /// updates the current playback state by fetching data from the spotify client
    async fn update_current_playback_state(&self, state: &state::SharedState) -> Result<()> {
        state.player.write().unwrap().playback = self.get_current_playback().await?;
        state.player.write().unwrap().playback_last_updated = Some(std::time::Instant::now());
        Ok(())
    }

    /// cleans up a list of albums (sort by date, remove duplicated entries, etc)
    fn clean_up_artist_albums(

```
