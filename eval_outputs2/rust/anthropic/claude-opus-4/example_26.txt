Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- The HEAD version includes fields `parent: _` and `specifier: _` in the destructuring pattern
- The other branch (02345a5a7d7d86c96820e2c1a3d9dbf91d1ec538) doesn't have these fields

This appears to be a case where the `PubGrubDependency` struct was modified in one branch to include additional fields (`parent` and `specifier`), while the other branch doesn't have these changes.

Since both sides are ignoring these fields with `_` anyway (they're not being used), and the code is only extracting `package` and `version` to return as a tuple, the semantic intent of both sides is the same: extract only the `package` and `version` fields while ignoring everything else.

The resolution should include the additional fields from HEAD to match the updated struct definition, as removing them would likely cause a compilation error if the struct actually has these fields.

```rust
            for_version.clone(),
            dependencies.into_iter().map(|dependency| {
                let PubGrubDependency {
                    package,
                    version,
                    parent: _,
                    specifier: _,
                    url: _,
                } = dependency;
                (package, version)
            }),
        );

```
