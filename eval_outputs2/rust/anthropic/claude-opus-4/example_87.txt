Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to define the same `impl` block for `BuildChildren` on `EntityCommands`, but with different lifetime parameter orderings:

- HEAD has: `<'w, 's, 'a>`
- The other branch has: `<'s, 'w, 'a>`

This appears to be a simple ordering difference of lifetime parameters. Since both versions are semantically equivalent (the order of lifetime parameters doesn't affect functionality), I should pick one consistent ordering. Looking at Rust conventions and the fact that `'w` typically represents "world" and `'s` typically represents "system" in game engines like Bevy, either ordering would work.

I'll resolve by keeping the HEAD version since it's already in the codebase:

```rust
    fn with_children(&mut self, f: impl FnOnce(&mut ChildBuilder)) -> &mut Self;
    fn push_children(&mut self, children: &[Entity]) -> &mut Self;
    fn insert_children(&mut self, index: usize, children: &[Entity]) -> &mut Self;
}

impl<'w, 's, 'a> BuildChildren for EntityCommands<'w, 's, 'a> {
    fn with_children(&mut self, spawn_children: impl FnOnce(&mut ChildBuilder)) -> &mut Self {
        let parent = self.id();
        let push_children = {
            let mut builder = ChildBuilder {
                commands: self.commands(),
```
