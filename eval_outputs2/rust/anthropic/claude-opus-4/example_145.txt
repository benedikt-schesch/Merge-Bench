Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD** (left side): Uses `ref mut shapestroke` - explicitly taking a mutable reference to the shapestroke
- **Right side** (commit ed50227...): Uses just `shapestroke` - relying on pattern matching to automatically handle the reference

The key observation is that in the code block, `shapestroke.update_geometry()` is called, which requires a mutable reference to work. 

In modern Rust, when pattern matching on a mutable reference (like `&mut Stroke`), the pattern `Stroke::ShapeStroke(shapestroke)` automatically gives you a mutable reference to the inner value when needed. The explicit `ref mut` is unnecessary and more verbose.

Since both versions achieve the same semantic intent (getting a mutable reference to call `update_geometry()`), and the right side uses the more idiomatic modern Rust syntax, I'll resolve in favor of the cleaner approach:

```rust
                    brushstroke.update_geometry();
                    self.key_tree.update_with_key(key, stroke.bounds());

                    self.set_rendering_dirty(key);
                }
                Stroke::ShapeStroke(shapestroke) => {
                    shapestroke.update_geometry();
                    self.key_tree.update_with_key(key, stroke.bounds());

                    self.set_rendering_dirty(key);
                }

```
