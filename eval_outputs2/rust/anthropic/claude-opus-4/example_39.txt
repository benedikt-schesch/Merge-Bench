Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has added `IndexResponse` and `ChangePasswordRequest` to the imports, while the other branch has a cleaner import list without these additions.

Since both sides are trying to import API-related types and the HEAD branch appears to have additional functionality (index and change password features), I'll resolve this by keeping all the imports from HEAD while maintaining the formatting style of the shorter branch.

```rust
    Response, StatusCode, Url,
};

use atuin_common::{
    api::{
        AddHistoryRequest, CountResponse, DeleteHistoryRequest, ErrorResponse, IndexResponse,
        LoginRequest, LoginResponse, RegisterResponse, StatusResponse, SyncHistoryResponse, ChangePasswordRequest,
    },
    record::RecordStatus,
};
use atuin_common::{
    api::{ATUIN_CARGO_VERSION, ATUIN_HEADER_VERSION, ATUIN_VERSION},

```
