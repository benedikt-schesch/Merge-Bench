Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD version: `ret = c.newInstance(args.toArray());`
- Incoming version: `ret = c.newInstance((Object[])args);`

The key difference is how the `args` variable is being passed to `newInstance()`. The HEAD version calls `toArray()` on `args`, suggesting `args` is likely a Collection (like List or Set). The incoming version casts `args` directly to `Object[]`, suggesting `args` might already be an array.

Without seeing the declaration of `args`, both approaches seem to be trying to pass the arguments as an array to the constructor. The `newInstance()` method expects an `Object[]` parameter.

Since both versions are semantically trying to achieve the same thing (pass arguments as an array), and `toArray()` is the more flexible approach that works whether `args` is already an array or a Collection, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```java

                for (int i = 0; i < paramTypes.length; i++) {
                    paramTypes[i] = String.class;
                }
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(paramTypes);
                ret =  c.newInstance(args.toArray());
            } else {
                ret = objClass.newInstance();
            }
        }
        catch(NoSuchMethodException nme) {

```
