Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - creating an ArrayList to copy the players collection. The only difference is stylistic:

- HEAD uses explicit type parameter: `new ArrayList<Player>(players.size())`
- The other branch uses diamond operator: `new ArrayList<>(players.size())`

Since Java 7, the diamond operator (`<>`) is the preferred modern syntax as it reduces redundancy and the compiler can infer the type from the context. Both achieve exactly the same result.

I'll resolve this by using the more modern diamond operator syntax:

```java
    }
    return info;
  }

  public final List<Player> getPlayers() {
    final List<Player> copy = new ArrayList<>(players.size());
    copy.addAll(players);
    return copy;
  }
