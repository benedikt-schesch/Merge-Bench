Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to import the same three static imports, just in different orders:

1. `someInfo` from `org.fest.assertions.test.TestData`
2. `failBecauseExpectedAssertionErrorWasNotThrown` from `org.fest.test.TestFailures`
3. `emptyArray` from `org.fest.util.LongArrayFactory`

Since both sides have the same imports and the only difference is the ordering, I can resolve this by keeping all three imports in a consistent order. Following common Java conventions, I'll order them alphabetically by package name:

```java
 * Copyright @2010-2011 the original author or authors.
 */
package org.fest.assertions.internal.longarrays;

import static org.fest.assertions.error.ShouldBeNullOrEmpty.shouldBeNullOrEmpty;
import static org.fest.assertions.test.TestData.someInfo;
import static org.fest.test.TestFailures.failBecauseExpectedAssertionErrorWasNotThrown;
import static org.fest.util.LongArrayFactory.emptyArray;

import static org.mockito.Mockito.verify;

import org.junit.Test;
