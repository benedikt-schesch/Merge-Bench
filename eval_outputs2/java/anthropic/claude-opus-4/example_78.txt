Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Adds a new error code `CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND` related to custom decks with ID/URL/JSON
- **Incoming branch**: Adds two new error codes `CARDCAST_CANNOT_FIND` and `CARDCAST_INVALID_ID` related to Cardcast decks

Both sides are adding new error codes to what appears to be an enum or similar structure. There's no semantic conflict here - they're adding different error codes for different features. The conflict is purely positional because both sides are adding entries at the same location in the file.

The resolution should include all three new error codes in the proper order:

```java
    BAD_REQUEST("br", "Bad request."),
    @DuplicationAllowed
    BANNED(DisconnectReason.BANNED, "Banned."),
    CANNOT_JOIN_ANOTHER_GAME("cjag", "You cannot join another game."),
    CAPSLOCK("CL", "Try turning caps lock off."),
    CARDCAST_CANNOT_FIND("ccf", "Cannot find Cardcast deck with given ID. If you just added this"
            + " deck to Cardcast, wait a few minutes and try again."),
    CARDCAST_INVALID_ID("cii", "Invalid Cardcast ID. Must be exactly 5 characters."),
    CUSTOM_SET_CANNOT_FIND("cscf", "Cannot find custom deck with the given ID or URL or invalid JSON "
        + "was provided."),
    DO_NOT_HAVE_CARD("dnhc", "You don't have that card."),
    GAME_FULL("gf", "That game is full. Join another."),
    INVALID_CARD("ic", "Invalid card specified."),
    INVALID_GAME("ig", "Invalid game specified."),
    INVALID_ID_CODE("iid", "Identification code, if provided, must be between 8 and 100 characters,"
```
