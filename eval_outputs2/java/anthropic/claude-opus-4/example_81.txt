Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same method `getString2()` in what appears to be an interface (based on the context and the fact that this is inside what seems to be an interface definition).

The conflict is simply about whether to include the `public` modifier or not:
- HEAD version: `public String getString2();`
- Incoming version: `String getString2();`

In Java interfaces, methods are `public` by default, so both versions are semantically identical. The more modern Java style guide recommends omitting redundant modifiers in interfaces. Since the incoming change appears to be cleaning up the code by removing the redundant `public` modifier, I'll resolve in favor of the cleaner version without the `public` keyword.

    String getString2();
  }
