Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they both want to define the `isNotEqualTo` method. The only difference is formatting: one side (HEAD) has no space before the opening brace `{`, while the other side has a space before it `{`.

The second conflict marker at the bottom appears to be incomplete in the provided snippet, but based on the pattern and the fact that both sides seem to be implementing the same functionality with only formatting differences, I'll resolve this by choosing the version with the space before the brace (which is more consistent with Java coding conventions).

```java
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

  public LongAssert isNotEqualTo(long expected) {
    longs.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
