Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import Vector3, but from different packages:

- HEAD wants: `import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;`
- The other branch wants: `import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;` (and also adds `import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region;`)

Based on the context and the fact that all other imports are from `org.spout.api.*` packages, it appears the intent is to use the API version of Vector3. The HEAD version seems to be using a different package structure (`org.spout.math.vector`) which might be from a refactoring or different version.

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Import Vector3 (both sides want this)
2. The incoming branch also wants to import Region

Since the other imports are all from `org.spout.api.*`, I'll resolve this by using the API version of Vector3 and including the Region import:

```java
import org.spout.api.geo.LoadOption;
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.WorldSource;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Block;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Region;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.util.StringUtil;

/**
 * Represents a position in a World
 */

```
