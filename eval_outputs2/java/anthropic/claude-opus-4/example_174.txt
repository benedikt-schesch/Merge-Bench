Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to add a closing brace for the if statement and then add a new `run()` method, while the other branch appears to want to keep the code structure as it was (possibly with the closing brace appearing later).

Based on the context and typical Java code structure, it seems like:
1. The if statement needs to be properly closed with a brace
2. The HEAD branch wants to add a new `run()` method
3. The `setConsoleReader` method should remain after these changes

Here's the resolved conflict that preserves both intents:

```java
        if (in != null)
        {
            parser = new GruntParser(in);
            parser.setParams(pig);    
        }
    }

    public void run() {
        parser.setInteractive(true);
        parser.parseContOnError();
    }

    public void setConsoleReader(ConsoleReader c)
    {
        parser.setConsoleReader(c);

```
