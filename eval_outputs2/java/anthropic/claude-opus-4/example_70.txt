Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Returns `new ArrayList<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>(0)`
- Incoming change: Returns `new ArrayList<>(0)`

Both sides want to return an empty ArrayList when the condition in the else block is met. The key difference is:
- HEAD explicitly specifies the generic type `Map<WhiteCardData, Object>`
- The incoming change uses the diamond operator `<>` which relies on type inference

Looking at the context, the method appears to be returning white card data, and the `getWhiteCardData(hand)` method likely returns a `List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>`.

The semantic intent of both sides is the same - return an empty list. The incoming change is using more modern Java syntax (diamond operator, available since Java 7) which is cleaner and lets the compiler infer the type from the method's return type declaration.

Since both achieve the same result and the diamond operator is the more modern, cleaner approach, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```java
      final List<WhiteCard> hand = player.getHand();
      synchronized (hand) {
        return getWhiteCardData(hand);
      }
    } else {
      return new ArrayList<>(0);
    }
  }

  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
