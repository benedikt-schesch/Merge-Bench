Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

**HEAD (left side):**
- Writes `nameTagVisibility` for protocol version 1.8+
- Writes `collisionRule` for protocol version 1.9+
- Writes `color` for protocol version 1.8+

**Other branch (right side):**
- Only writes `collisionRule` for protocol version 1.8+

The key insight is that the HEAD branch has more complete protocol handling with version-specific fields, while the other branch seems to have an incomplete or incorrect implementation (writing `collisionRule` for 1.8+ when it should only be for 1.9+).

The semantic intent appears to be implementing proper protocol version handling for team packets. The HEAD version is more complete and correct, as it:
1. Properly gates `nameTagVisibility` for 1.8+
2. Properly gates `collisionRule` for 1.9+ (not 1.8+)
3. Includes the `color` field for 1.8+

Here's the resolved code:

```java
            writeString( prefix, buf );
            writeString( suffix, buf );
            buf.writeByte( friendlyFire );
            if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 )
            {
                writeString( nameTagVisibility, buf );
                if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_9 )
                {
                    writeString( collisionRule, buf);
                }
                buf.writeByte( color );
            }
        }
        if ( mode == 0 || mode == 3 || mode == 4 )
        {
            if ( protocolVersion >= ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_8 )
```
