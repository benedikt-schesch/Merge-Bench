Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Creates a `GruntParser` with only a `StringReader` parameter
- **Incoming change**: Creates a `GruntParser` with both a `StringReader` and a `myPig` parameter

From the context, this appears to be a test case that's parsing a Pig script. The incoming change is adding an additional parameter (`myPig`) to the `GruntParser` constructor, which likely represents a Pig instance needed for parsing context.

Without seeing the full class context or the `GruntParser` constructor signatures, the most likely scenario is that the API has been updated to require a Pig instance for proper parsing context. The incoming change appears to be the more complete/correct version.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "dump b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();

```
