Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import test classes from `org.fest.test` package:

- HEAD is importing specific classes: `Employee` and `Name`
- The other branch is using a wildcard import: `org.fest.test.*`

Since the wildcard import (`org.fest.test.*`) will include both `Employee` and `Name` classes along with any other classes in that package, the semantic intent of both sides is preserved by using the wildcard import. This is the simpler and more inclusive solution.

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

import java.util.*;

import org.fest.assertions.internal.PropertySupport;
import org.fest.test.*;
import org.junit.*;

/**
 * Tests for <code>{@link Properties#from(Object[])}</code>.
 * 

```
