Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the conflict is about whether to include the `@Private` annotation before the `setBackendException` method.

The HEAD version (current branch) does not have the annotation, while the incoming branch (f6a8f7aa42cae344f71cc6759f1c7880b49211fc) adds the `@Private` annotation.

Since the `@Private` annotation is typically used to mark internal APIs that should not be used by external code, and this appears to be a setter method for backend exceptions, it makes semantic sense to include this annotation. The incoming change is adding documentation/visibility constraints without changing the actual functionality.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
        public int compare(JobStats o1, JobStats o2) {
            return o1.getJobId().compareTo(o2.getJobId());
        }
    }

    @Private
    public void setBackendException(String jobId, Exception e) {
        if (e instanceof PigException) {
            LOG.error("ERROR " + ((PigException)e).getErrorCode() + ": "
                    + e.getLocalizedMessage());
        } else if (e != null) {

```
