Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Uses `bungee.getConfig().getCustomServerName()` - this appears to allow for a configurable/custom server name
- **Incoming change**: Uses the hardcoded string `"BungeeCord"` 

The semantic intent seems to be about what server name to display in the version field. The HEAD version provides flexibility by reading from configuration, while the incoming change uses a fixed name.

Since the HEAD version is more flexible and allows customization while still achieving the same goal (showing a server name + game version), it's the better semantic choice. A custom server name configuration would likely default to "BungeeCord" anyway if not set, maintaining backward compatibility.

```java

                data.put( "hostname", listener.getMotd() );
                data.put( "gametype", "SMP" );
                // Start Extra Info
                data.put( "game_id", "MINECRAFT" );
                data.put( "version", bungee.getConfig().getCustomServerName() + " " + bungee.getGameVersion() );
                data.put( "plugins", "" );
                // End Extra Info
                data.put( "map", "BungeeCord_Proxy" );
                data.put( "numplayers", Integer.toString( bungee.getOnlineCount() ) );
                data.put( "maxplayers", Integer.toString( listener.getMaxPlayers() ) );
