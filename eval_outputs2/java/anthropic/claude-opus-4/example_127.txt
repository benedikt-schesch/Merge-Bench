Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to format the same message about making a repository public, but with different emphasis through HTML bold tags.

- HEAD version: emphasizes the action "made" and the state "public"
- Other version: emphasizes the repository name

Since both versions are semantically trying to convey the same information and the conflict is purely about styling/emphasis, I'll preserve the conflict as-is since the intent is ambiguous - it's not clear which emphasis pattern is preferred without more context about the project's formatting conventions.

```java
        return event.payload.action + " " + "<b>" + event.repo.name + "#" + event.payload.issue.number + "</b>";
      case MemberEvent:
        return " " + event.payload.action + " " + "<b>" + event.payload.member.login + "</b>" + " " + " to " + event.repo.name;
      case PublicEvent:
        if (event.repo != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
          return " <b>made</b> " + event.repo.name + " <b>public</b>";
=======
          return " made <b>" + event.repo.name + "</b> public";
>>>>>>> ca63bf35d05c86122ad0b10a2887245523f1ca2f
        } else {
          return "";
        }
      case PullRequestEvent:
        String action = event.payload.action;
