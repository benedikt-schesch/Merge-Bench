Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they're both declaring the same two ArrayList variables. The only difference is the syntax used:

- HEAD uses the older Java syntax with explicit type parameters: `new ArrayList<User>()`
- The incoming change uses the diamond operator introduced in Java 7: `new ArrayList<>()`

Since both achieve the exact same result and the diamond operator is the more modern, preferred syntax in Java 7+, I'll resolve this by using the newer syntax:

```java
    }
  }

  private void skipIdlePlayers() {
    killRoundTimer();
    final List<User> playersToRemove = new ArrayList<>();
    final List<Player> playersToUpdateStatus = new ArrayList<>();
    synchronized (roundPlayers) {

      for (final Player player : roundPlayers) {
        final List<WhiteCard> cards = playedCards.getCards(player);
        if (cards == null || cards.size() < blackCard.getPick()) {

```
