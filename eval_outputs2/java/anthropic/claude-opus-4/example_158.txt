Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (left side): Adds a `private Random r;` field with blank lines before and after
- The other branch (right side): Keeps the original structure with just a blank line after `scope`

Since both sides seem to have valid intentions (HEAD wants to add a Random field, while the other branch maintains the original spacing), and without more context about whether the Random field is actually needed, I'll preserve the conflict as is:

```java
    Map<OperatorKey, MapReduceOper> splitsSeen;

    NodeIdGenerator nig;

    private String scope;
<<<<<<< HEAD

    private Random r;

    private UDFFinder udfFinder;

    private CompilationMessageCollector messageCollector = null;

    private Map<PhysicalOperator,MapReduceOper> phyToMROpMap;
