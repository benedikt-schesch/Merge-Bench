Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add configuration settings to a builder. Let me analyze the intent:

- The BASE/HEAD side wants to add `insecureIdAllowed` configuration
- The incoming side wants to add `gameChatEnabled` configuration
- Both sides also reference `broadcastingUsers`/`BroadcastConnectsAndDisconnects.class`

The semantic intent is to include both new configuration options. Here's the resolved conflict:

```java
        .getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, BroadcastConnectsAndDisconnects.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.COOKIE_DOMAIN = '%s';\n", cookieDomain));
    boolean globalChatEnabled = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, GlobalChatEnabled.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED = %b;\n", globalChatEnabled));
    boolean gameChatEnabled = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, GameChatEnabled.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED = %b;\n", gameChatEnabled));
    boolean insecureIdAllowed = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, InsecureIdAllowed.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.INSECURE_ID_ALLOWED = %b;\n", insecureIdAllowed));
    boolean broadcastingUsers = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, BroadcastConnectsAndDisconnects.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.BROADCASTING_USERS = %b;\n", broadcastingUsers));
