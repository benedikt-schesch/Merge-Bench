Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add an author to the JavaDoc comments. The conflict is simply about which author to include in the list.

Based on the semantic intent, both sides want to acknowledge contributors to this code. The most reasonable resolution is to keep both authors, maintaining them in alphabetical order by last name.

```java
 *          for more details.
 * @param <A> the type of the "actual" value.
 * 
 * @author Alex Ruiz
 * @author Joel Costigliola
 * @author Mikhail Mazursky
 * @author Nicolas Fran√ßois

public abstract class AbstractAssert<S extends AbstractAssert<S, A>, A> implements Assert<S, A> {

  @VisibleForTesting
  Objects objects = Objects.instance();
