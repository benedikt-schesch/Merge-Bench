Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Uses wildcard import `import static junit.framework.Assert.*;` and imports some test utilities
- **Incoming changes**: Uses specific imports `import static junit.framework.Assert.assertEquals;` and `import static junit.framework.Assert.assertSame;`

Both sides want to import JUnit assertions and test utilities. The semantic difference is between wildcard imports vs specific imports. Since the incoming changes show explicit imports (which is generally a better practice), and both sides need the test utilities, I'll combine them by using the specific imports approach and including all necessary imports.
