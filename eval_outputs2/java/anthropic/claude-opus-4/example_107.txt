Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version has no imports between the `@Rule` import and the `ExpectedException` import, while the incoming branch is trying to add two imports:
- `org.fest.assertions.internal.Failures`
- `org.fest.assertions.internal.LongArrays`

Since both sides seem to have valid intentions (HEAD keeping a cleaner import list, and the incoming branch adding necessary imports that are likely used in the code), and without seeing the rest of the code to determine if these imports are actually needed, I cannot make a definitive decision about which version is correct.

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact:

```java
import java.util.Comparator;

import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Rule;

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
import org.fest.assertions.internal.Failures;

import org.fest.util.ComparatorBasedComparisonStrategy;
import org.fest.util.StandardComparisonStrategy;
