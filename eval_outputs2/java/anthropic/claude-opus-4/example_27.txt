Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to add an import for `org.spout.math.GenericMath`, while the other branch (cc07030...) appears to have removed it or kept that line blank.

Without more context about how `GenericMath` is used in the rest of the file, I cannot determine whether this import is actually needed. The conflict appears to be about whether to include this specific import statement.

Since I cannot determine the intent or whether `GenericMath` is used elsewhere in the code, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:
