Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to create a `GruntParser` object, but they differ in the constructor arguments:

- HEAD: `new GruntParser(new StringReader(script))`
- Incoming change: `new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig)`

The incoming change adds a second parameter `myPig` to the constructor. This appears to be an API change where the GruntParser now requires or accepts an additional parameter (likely a Pig instance for context).

Since the incoming change represents an evolution of the API (adding functionality rather than removing it), and assuming `myPig` is available in the current scope, the semantically correct resolution would be to use the version with both parameters.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "describe b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
