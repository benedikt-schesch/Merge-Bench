Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch): Wants to import two specific classes: `org.fest.test.Employee` and `org.fest.test.Name`
- Incoming change: Wants to use a wildcard import: `org.fest.test.*`

The semantic intent appears to be that both sides want to import classes from the `org.fest.test` package. The incoming change with the wildcard import `org.fest.test.*` would include both `Employee` and `Name` classes that HEAD explicitly imports, plus any other classes from that package.

Since the wildcard import is more inclusive and would satisfy the needs of the HEAD branch while potentially providing access to other classes that might be needed, the semantic resolution would be to use the wildcard import.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

import java.beans.PropertyDescriptor;
import java.util.*;

import org.fest.test.*;
import org.fest.util.IntrospectionError;
import org.junit.*;

/**
 * Tests for <code>{@link PropertySupport#propertyValues(String, Collection)}</code>.
```
