Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) is trying to import `org.spout.api.protocol.CommonHandler`, while the other side removed or never had this import.

Without more context about how `CommonHandler` is used in the code below this snippet, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The import might be needed for code that follows, or it might have been intentionally removed as part of a refactoring.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
import org.spout.api.geo.World;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Point;
import org.spout.api.geo.discrete.Transform;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector2;
<<<<<<< HEAD
