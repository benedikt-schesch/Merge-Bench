Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different import statements:

- HEAD wants to import: `import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;`
- The other branch wants to import: `import org.spout.api.Client;`

Since these are two different imports that serve different purposes, and there's no semantic conflict between them (they're just additions to the import list), the resolution should include both imports.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

import org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.HashCodeBuilder;

import org.spout.api.Client;
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.api.Platform;
import org.spout.api.Spout;
import org.spout.api.component.BaseComponentOwner;
import org.spout.api.component.Component;
import org.spout.api.component.entity.EntityComponent;
