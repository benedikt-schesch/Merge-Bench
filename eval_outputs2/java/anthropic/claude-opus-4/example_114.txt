Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add an author to the JavaDoc comment. The conflict is between:
- HEAD: `@author Olivier Michallat`
- Incoming: `@author Olivier Demeijer`

Since these are two different people (different last names), and author tags in JavaDoc are meant to document all contributors to a class, the semantic intent is to acknowledge both authors' contributions. The appropriate resolution is to include both author lines.

```java
 * </p>
 * 
 * @author David DIDIER
 * @author Yvonne Wang
 * @author Alex Ruiz
 * @author Olivier Michallat
 * @author Olivier Demeijer
 */
public class FileAssert extends AbstractAssert<FileAssert, File> {

  @VisibleForTesting
  Files files = Files.instance();
