Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they want to check if `args` has elements and create a `paramTypes` array of the same size. The conflict appears to be about whether `args` is a collection (using `.size()`) or an array (using `.length`).

Since both sides:
1. Check for null and non-empty args
2. Create a Class array with the same number of elements as args
3. Use the same loop structure referencing `paramTypes.length`

The key difference is just the type of `args`. Without seeing the full context of how `args` is declared, I cannot determine which version is correct. This is a case where the resolution depends on information not present in the snippet.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
            throw new RuntimeException("Cannot instantiate:" + className, ioe) ;
        }

        try {
            // Do normal instantiation
<<<<<<< HEAD
            if (args != null && args.size() > 0) {
                Class paramTypes[] = new Class[args.size()];
=======
            if (args != null && args.length > 0) {
                Class paramTypes[] = new Class[args.length];

                for (int i = 0; i < paramTypes.length; i++) {
                    paramTypes[i] = String.class;
                }
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(paramTypes);
