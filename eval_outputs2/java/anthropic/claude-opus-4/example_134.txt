Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - calling `MapRedUtil.setupUDFContext(jConf)`. The only difference is the indentation:

- HEAD uses spaces for indentation
- The other branch uses a tab character for indentation

Since the surrounding code uses spaces for indentation (as seen in the context above and below the conflict), I should resolve this by keeping the version with spaces to maintain consistency.

```java
                    roots = rp.getRoots().toArray(new PhysicalOperator[1]);
                    leaf = rp.getLeaves().get(0);
                }

                // Get the UDF specific context
                MapRedUtil.setupUDFContext(jConf);

            } catch (IOException ioe) {
                String msg = "Problem while configuring reduce plan.";
                throw new RuntimeException(msg, ioe);
            }

```
