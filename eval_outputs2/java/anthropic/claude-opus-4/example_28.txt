Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD version is trying to import classes related to position and rotation (`Point` and `Quaternion`) for a `PositionSendEvent`
2. The incoming change is importing `Chunk` for a `BlockUpdateEvent`

The conflict appears to be that these are two different classes merged into the same file. Based on the class declaration `public class BlockUpdateEvent extends ProtocolEvent` and the member variables that reference `Chunk` and coordinates, it's clear that this file should be `BlockUpdateEvent`, not `PositionSendEvent`.

The correct resolution is to keep the incoming change's imports since they match the actual class being defined:

```java
 */
package org.spout.api.protocol.event;

import org.spout.api.event.HandlerList;
import org.spout.api.event.ProtocolEvent;
import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;

public class BlockUpdateEvent extends ProtocolEvent {
	private static final HandlerList handlers = new HandlerList();
	private final Chunk chunk;
	private final int x, y, z;

```
