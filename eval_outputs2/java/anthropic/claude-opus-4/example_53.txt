Looking at this merge conflict, both sides appear to have the same logical intent - they're checking if `playerCards` is not null, `blackCard` is not null, and if the size of `playerCards` equals `blackCard.getPick()`. 

The only difference is formatting:
- HEAD has the condition split across multiple lines
- The other branch has it all on one line

Since both versions are semantically identical and this is just a formatting difference, I'll preserve the HEAD version which uses multi-line formatting as it's generally more readable for longer conditions.

```java
          if (!roundPlayers.contains(player)) {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
            break;
          }
          final List<WhiteCard> playerCards = playedCards.getCards(player);
          if (playerCards != null && blackCard != null
              && playerCards.size() == blackCard.getPick()) {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.IDLE;
          } else {
            playerStatus = GamePlayerStatus.PLAYING;
          }
        }
