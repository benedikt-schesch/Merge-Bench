Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to initialize an ArrayList with an initial capacity based on the size of a JSONArray called `textParts`. The conflict is about whether to use `textParts.size()` or `textParts.length()`.

For JSONArray objects in Java (likely using org.json or similar library), the correct method to get the number of elements is `length()`, not `size()`. The `size()` method is typically used for Java Collections like List, while `length()` is used for arrays and JSONArray objects.

Since the code is iterating over a JSONArray and the second branch uses `textParts.length()`, which is the correct method for JSONArray, I'll resolve the conflict by using `length()`:

```java
  private CustomCardFormatHelper() {
  }

  public static String formatBlackCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // TODO this is going to need some work to look pretty.
    final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());
    for (final Object o : textParts) {
      strs.add((String) o);
    }
    final String text = StringUtils.join(strs, "____");
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml11(text);

```
