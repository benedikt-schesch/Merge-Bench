Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD branch has:
   - Additional imports (`PluginLoader` and `Protocol`)
   - The class implements `Plugin` interface
   - Has fields for `PluginDescriptionFile`, `Engine`, and `PluginDictionary`

2. The incoming branch (77ca2cb) has:
   - Fewer imports
   - The class extends `Plugin` (rather than implements)
   - Has a constructor that takes an `Engine` parameter
   - Initializes `engine` and `file` fields in the constructor

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants the class to implement the Plugin interface with certain fields
- The incoming branch wants the class to extend Plugin as a base class with a constructor

Since extending a class is generally more specific than implementing an interface (and `Plugin` is likely meant to be a base class given the constructor pattern), and the constructor initialization is important, I'll merge these by:
1. Using `extends Plugin` from the incoming branch
2. Keeping the imports from HEAD that might be needed
3. Keeping the fields from HEAD
4. Keeping the constructor from the incoming branch

```java

import org.spout.api.Engine;
import org.spout.api.Spout;
import org.spout.api.plugin.Plugin;
import org.spout.api.plugin.PluginDescriptionFile;
import org.spout.api.plugin.PluginLoader;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Protocol;

public final class SpoutMetaPlugin extends Plugin {
	private PluginDescriptionFile pdf;
	private Engine engine;
	private PluginDictionary dictionary; // TODO extend this dictionary to load translation from a different location

	public SpoutMetaPlugin(Engine engine) {
		this.engine = engine;
		file = new File(engine.getClass().getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().getPath().replaceAll("%20", " "));
