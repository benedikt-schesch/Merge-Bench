Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import test-related classes, but they're coming from different packages. The conflict appears to be about:

1. The file location/package structure has changed between branches
2. The import statements for `ExpectedException` and `Fail` classes

Based on the context and typical patterns in test code:
- The HEAD branch uses `org.fest.util.ExpectedException`
- The other branch uses `org.fest.assertions.test.ExpectedException` and adds an import for `Fail`

Since this is testing the `Fail.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown` method (as indicated by the test class name and JavaDoc), we likely need both the `Fail` import and an `ExpectedException` import. The question is which `ExpectedException` to use.

Given that the file path in the non-HEAD branch shows a more specific package structure (`org/fest/assertions/api/fail/`), and it's importing from `org.fest.assertions.test.ExpectedException`, this seems to be the more recent/correct structure.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import static org.fest.util.ExpectedException.none;

import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;

import org.fest.assertions.api.Fail;
import org.fest.assertions.test.ExpectedException;

/**
 * Tests for <code>{@link Fail#failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(Class)}</code>.
