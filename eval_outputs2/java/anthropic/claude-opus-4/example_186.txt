Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD side (left) appears to be from a file called `StarSpec.java` and contains import statements for ArrayList, List, and Properties
2. The other side (right) is from a file called `NodeIdGenerator.java` and contains a package declaration `package org.apache.pig.impl.plan;`
3. Both sides have imports for Map and HashMap after the conflict

This appears to be a case where two different files were merged incorrectly, or a file was renamed/moved. Based on the file path in the conflict marker showing `NodeIdGenerator.java` on the right side, and the class name `NodeIdGenerator` at the bottom, it seems the correct resolution is to use the right side's package declaration.

Here's the resolved code:

package org.apache.pig.impl.plan;

import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class NodeIdGenerator {
