Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to format the same method signature differently:

- HEAD version has the exceptions on separate lines with specific indentation
- The other version has both exceptions on the same line

Since this is purely a formatting difference with no semantic changes, I'll keep the more compact version (from the branch) as it's more conventional for Java method signatures when they fit on one line:

```java
   *
   * @param user Spectator to add to this game.
   * @throws TooManySpectatorsException Thrown if this game is at its maximum spectator capacity.
   * @throws IllegalStateException      Thrown if {@code user} is already in a game.
   */
  public void addSpectator(final User user) throws TooManySpectatorsException, IllegalStateException {
    logger.info(String.format("%s joined game %d as a spectator.", user.toString(), id));
    synchronized (spectators) {
      if (spectators.size() >= options.spectatorLimit) {
        throw new TooManySpectatorsException();
      }

```
