Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a simple formatting difference. Both sides have the same functional code - they just differ in the number of blank lines between the `read` method and the `skip` method.

HEAD has one blank line, while the incoming change has two blank lines. Since this is purely a formatting difference with no semantic change, I'll preserve the more common convention of a single blank line between methods.

```java
    public int read(byte b[], int off, int len) throws IOException {
        int read = in.read(b, off, len);
        pos += read;
        return read;
    }
    
    @Override
    public long skip(long n) throws IOException {
        long rc = in.skip(n);
        pos += rc;
        return rc;
```
