Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to declare the same `ThreadLocal<Configuration>` field named `sJobConfInternal`, but with slightly different modifiers:

- HEAD version: `public static ThreadLocal<Configuration> sJobConfInternal = new ThreadLocal<Configuration>();`
- Other version: `public static final ThreadLocal<Configuration> sJobConfInternal = new ThreadLocal<Configuration>();`

The only difference is that the other version adds the `final` modifier. Since this is a `ThreadLocal` field being initialized at declaration, making it `final` is actually a good practice as it prevents the reference from being reassigned while still allowing the thread-local values to be modified. This aligns with the principle of least mutability.

Given that both sides have the same intent (declaring a ThreadLocal field) and the `final` version is more restrictive and follows better practices, I'll resolve this by choosing the version with `final`:

```java
     * <pre>UdfContext.getUdfContext().getJobConf()</pre>
     */
    @Deprecated
    public static Configuration sJobConf = null;

    public static final ThreadLocal<Configuration> sJobConfInternal = new ThreadLocal<Configuration>();

    public static class Map extends PigMapBase {

        @Override
        public void collect(Context oc, Tuple tuple)

```
