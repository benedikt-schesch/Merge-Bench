Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add author credits to the JavaDoc comment. The conflict appears to be about:

1. **HEAD side**: Adds two authors - "Nicolas François" and "Mikhail Mazursky"
2. **Other side**: Adds only "Nicolas François"

The semantic intent of both sides is to credit Nicolas François as an author. The HEAD side additionally wants to credit Mikhail Mazursky. Since both sides agree on adding Nicolas François and there's no conflict in that intent, the resolution should include both authors.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
 * @author Yvonne Wang
 * @author Alex Ruiz
 * @author Mathieu Baechler
 * @author Joel Costigliola
 * @author Maciej Jaskowski
 * @author Nicolas François
 * @author Mikhail Mazursky
 */
public abstract class AbstractIterableAssert<S extends AbstractIterableAssert<S, A>, A extends Iterable<?>> extends
    AbstractAssert<S, A> implements ObjectEnumerableAssert<S> {

  @VisibleForTesting Iterables iterables = Iterables.instance();

```
