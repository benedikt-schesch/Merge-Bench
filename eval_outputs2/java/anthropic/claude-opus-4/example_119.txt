Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (the branch being merged in) is trying to add an import for `com.afollestad.materialdialogs.MaterialDialog`, while HEAD doesn't have this import.

Based on the context and the fact that this appears to be a simple import addition with no conflicting changes, the semantic intent is clear: the feature branch needs the MaterialDialog import for some functionality it's adding. There's no actual conflict in intent here - it's just an additive change.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import android.text.TextUtils;
import android.text.TextWatcher;
import android.view.Menu;
import android.view.MenuItem;
import android.widget.Toast;
import com.afollestad.materialdialogs.MaterialDialog;
import com.alorma.github.R;
import com.alorma.github.bean.SearchableUser;
import com.alorma.github.cache.CacheWrapper;
import com.alorma.github.emoji.Emoji;
import com.alorma.github.emoji.EmojisActivity;

```
