Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

1. The HEAD version has no imports between the package declaration and the next imports
2. The incoming change (ed08e371...) is trying to add several imports including Guice-related imports and a CahModule import

Since this appears to be at the beginning of a Java file where imports belong, and the incoming change is adding legitimate import statements that are likely needed for dependency injection functionality, the semantic intent is to add these new imports to support new functionality while maintaining the existing code structure.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
 * WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
 */

package net.socialgamer.cah.data;

import com.google.inject.Inject;
import com.google.inject.Provider;
import net.socialgamer.cah.CahModule.*;
import net.socialgamer.cah.Constants.GameOptionData;
import net.socialgamer.cah.JsonWrapper;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.HashSet;
