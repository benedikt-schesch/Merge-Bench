Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side wants to import `BufferedInputStream` while the other wants to import `BufferedReader`. These are two different classes used for different purposes in Java I/O:

- `BufferedInputStream` is used for reading binary data efficiently
- `BufferedReader` is used for reading text data line by line

Without more context about how these imports are used in the rest of the file, I cannot determine which one (or if both) should be included. The semantic intent is ambiguous as it depends on what type of I/O operations the code is performing.

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:
