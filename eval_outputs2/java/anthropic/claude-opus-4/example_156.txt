Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Creates a `GruntParser` with only a `StringReader` parameter
- **Right side**: Creates a `GruntParser` with both a `StringReader` and a `myPig` parameter

This appears to be a change in the `GruntParser` constructor API. The right side seems to be adding a `myPig` parameter to the constructor, likely to pass the Pig instance to the parser for better integration or context sharing.

Given that:
1. The `myPig` variable is already in scope (used in the next line: `myPig.getPigContext()`)
2. The right side appears to be a deliberate API change to pass the Pig instance to the parser
3. This would allow the parser to have direct access to the Pig context

The semantic intent appears to be updating the code to use a new version of the `GruntParser` constructor that requires the Pig instance. The right side should be accepted.

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "illustrate b;"
                          + "store b into '" + TMP_DIR + "/Pig-TestMultiQueryLocal1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            myPig.getPigContext().getProperties().setProperty("pig.usenewlogicalplan", "true");
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
