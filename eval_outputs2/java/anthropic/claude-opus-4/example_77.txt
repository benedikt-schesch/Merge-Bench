Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import logging functionality, but they're using different logging frameworks:

- HEAD (current branch) is using Log4j 2.x (org.apache.logging.log4j)
- The incoming branch is using Log4j 1.x (org.apache.log4j)

Since Log4j 2.x is the newer version and Log4j 1.x is deprecated/has known security vulnerabilities, the semantic intent appears to be updating the logging framework. The HEAD version with Log4j 2.x should be preferred.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import net.socialgamer.cah.RequestWrapper;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.ConnectedUsers;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.QueuedMessage;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.QueuedMessage.MessageType;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.User;

import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpSession;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
