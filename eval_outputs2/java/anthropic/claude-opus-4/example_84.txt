Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to initialize an ArrayList with an initial capacity based on the size of a JSONArray called `textParts`.

The conflict is between:
- HEAD: `textParts.size()`
- Other branch: `textParts.length()`

For JSONArray objects in Java (particularly in org.json library), the correct method to get the number of elements is `length()`, not `size()`. The `size()` method doesn't exist on JSONArray.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml11(text);
  }

  public static String formatWhiteCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // The white cards should only ever have one element in text, but let's be safe.
    final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());
    for (final Object o : textParts) {
      final String cardCastString = (String) o;
      if (cardCastString.isEmpty()) {
        // skip blank segments
        continue;
```
