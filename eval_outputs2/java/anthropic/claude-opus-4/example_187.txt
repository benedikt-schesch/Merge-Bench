Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Simply assigns the input stream directly to `this.in`
- **Right side**: Adds logic to conditionally wrap the input stream in a BufferedInputStream, except when it's a CBZip2InputStream (to avoid problems with split records)

The semantic intent of the right side is clear: it wants to add buffering to improve performance, but recognizes that CBZip2InputStream shouldn't be buffered due to issues with split records. This is a meaningful enhancement over the simple assignment in HEAD.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```java
    long pos;
    InputStream in;
    final int bufSize = 1024;
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in, long pos) {
		// Don't buffer a bzip stream as it will cause problems for split
		// records.
		if (in instanceof CBZip2InputStream) this.in = in;
		else this.in = new BufferedInputStream(in, bufSize);
        this.pos = pos;
    }
    
    public BufferedPositionedInputStream(InputStream in){
        this(in,0);

```
