Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - adding a round permalink to the data map. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD version: Multi-line formatting with the second argument on a new line
- Other version: Single-line formatting

Since both versions are semantically identical and the difference is purely stylistic, I'll preserve the more compact single-line format as it's consistent with the other `data.put()` calls in the surrounding context:

```java
    data.put(LongPollResponse.EVENT, LongPollEvent.GAME_ROUND_COMPLETE.toString());
    data.put(LongPollResponse.ROUND_WINNER, cardPlayer.getUser().getNickname());
    data.put(LongPollResponse.WINNING_CARD, clientCardId);
    data.put(LongPollResponse.INTERMISSION, ROUND_INTERMISSION);
    if (showRoundLinkProvider.get()) {
      data.put(LongPollResponse.ROUND_PERMALINK, String.format(roundPermalinkFormatProvider.get(), roundId));
    }
    broadcastToPlayers(MessageType.GAME_EVENT, data);

    notifyPlayerInfoChange(getJudge());
    notifyPlayerInfoChange(cardPlayer);

```
