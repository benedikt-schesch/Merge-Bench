Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - adding a single-element list containing the face-down card data to `cardData`. The only difference is the implementation choice:

- HEAD uses `Arrays.asList()`
- The incoming change uses `Collections.singletonList()`

Both approaches are functionally equivalent for creating a single-element list. However, `Collections.singletonList()` is more semantically appropriate here because:
1. It explicitly indicates the intent to create a list with exactly one element
2. It's more efficient for single elements (immutable, less memory overhead)
3. It's the more modern/preferred approach for single-element lists

Since both sides have the same intent and the incoming change uses the better practice, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```java
          cardData.add(getWhiteCardData(playedCards.getCards(player)));
          faceDownCards--;
        }
        // TODO make this figure out how many blank cards in each spot, for multi-play cards
        while (faceDownCards-- > 0) {
          cardData.add(Collections.singletonList(WhiteCard.getFaceDownCardClientData()));
        }
        return cardData;
      }
    }
  }
```
