Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - declaring variables `className` and `funcSpec`. The conflict arises from different approaches:

- HEAD: Declares both variables in one line with `String className, funcSpec = null;` (both are String type)
- The other branch: Declares them separately with `String className = null;` and `FuncSpec funcSpec = null;` (different types)

The key semantic difference is that the other branch treats `funcSpec` as a `FuncSpec` type rather than a `String`. Given that:
1. The variable is later assigned from `definedFunctions.get(alias)`
2. The variable name suggests it should be a `FuncSpec` object
3. The separate declaration with explicit typing is more clear and type-safe

The intent from the other branch (with `FuncSpec` type) appears to be the correct resolution.

Here's the resolved code:

```java

    }
    
    
    public Class getClassForAlias(String alias) throws IOException{
        String className = null;
        FuncSpec funcSpec = null;
        if (definedFunctions != null) {
            funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias);
        }
        if (funcSpec != null) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
