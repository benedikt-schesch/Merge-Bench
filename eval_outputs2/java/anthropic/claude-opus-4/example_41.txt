Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - logging a message when resetting the game due to too few players. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD version has the string split across two lines
- The other branch has it on a single line

Since both versions have identical content and the single-line version is more concise and readable, I'll resolve by keeping the single-line version:

```java
      // this seems terrible
      if (players.size() == 0) {
        gameManager.destroyGame(id);
      }
      if (players.size() < 3 && state != GameState.LOBBY) {
        logger.info(String.format("Resetting game %d due to too few players after someone left.", id));
        resetState(true);
      } else if (wasJudge) {
        synchronized (roundTimerLock) {
          final SafeTimerTask task = new SafeTimerTask() {
            @Override

```
