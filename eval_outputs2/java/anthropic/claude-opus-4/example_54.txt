Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to log the same information when starting a game, but they're using different variable names for the custom/Cardcast deck IDs:

- HEAD uses: `customDecksIds`
- The other branch uses: `cardcastDeckIds`

Both appear to be referring to the same concept (Cardcast deck IDs), just with slightly different naming. Since the rest of the code is identical and the intent is the same (logging game start information), I'll preserve the HEAD version's variable name `customDecksIds` as it appears to be the more descriptive name.

```java
      } else {
        started = false;
      }
      if (started) {
        currentUniqueId = uniqueIdProvider.get();
        logger.info(String.format("Starting game %d with card sets %s, Cardcast %s, %d blanks, %d "
                + "max players, %d max spectators, %d score limit, players %s, unique %s.",
            id, options.cardSetIds, customDecksIds, options.blanksInDeck, options.playerLimit,
            options.spectatorLimit, options.scoreGoal, players, currentUniqueId));
        // do this stuff outside the players lock; they will lock players again later for much less
        // time, and not at the same time as trying to lock users, which has caused deadlocks
        final List<CardSet> cardSets;
        synchronized (options.cardSetIds) {
          cardSets = loadCardSets(session);

```
