Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Adds three new fields:
  - `jobOutputFile` - a String to track Pig Script Output
  - `jobConf` - a JobConf object for the currently executing Map-Reduce job
  - Includes empty lines for spacing

- **Incoming branch (1488b22...)**: Removes these fields entirely and goes directly to the `properties` field

Since both sides have valid intentions (HEAD wants to add functionality, incoming wants to keep it clean), and without more context about the project's requirements, I cannot determine which side should take precedence. The conflict represents a fundamental disagreement about whether these fields should exist in the codebase.

Here is the same snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
    // handle to the back-end
    transient private ExecutionEngine executionEngine;
   
    private String jobName = JOB_NAME_PREFIX;    // can be overwritten by users
  
<<<<<<< HEAD
    // Pig Script Output
    private String jobOutputFile = "";
    
    // JobConf of the currently executing Map-Reduce job
    JobConf jobConf;
