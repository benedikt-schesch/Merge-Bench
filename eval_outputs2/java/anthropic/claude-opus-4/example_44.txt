Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to format the same method signature for `broadcastToPlayers`, just with different line breaking styles:

- HEAD version: Method parameters are on separate lines with aligned indentation
- Other version: All parameters are on a single line

Since both versions are functionally identical and this is purely a formatting difference, I'll preserve the HEAD version as it follows a more readable multi-line format for methods with multiple parameters.

```java
   *
   * @param type       Type of message to broadcast. This determines the order the messages are returned by
   *                   priority.
   * @param masterData Message data to broadcast.
   */
  public void broadcastToPlayers(final MessageType type,
                                 final HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> masterData) {
    connectedUsers.broadcastToList(playersToUsers(), type, masterData);
  }

  /**
   * Sends updated player information about a specific player to all players in the game.

```
