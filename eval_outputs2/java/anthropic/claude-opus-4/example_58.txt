Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to create an ArrayList of WhiteCard objects with an initial capacity based on `newBlackCard.getDraw()`.

The only difference between the two versions is:
- HEAD uses the explicit type parameter: `new ArrayList<WhiteCard>(newBlackCard.getDraw())`
- The other branch uses the diamond operator: `new ArrayList<>(newBlackCard.getDraw())`

Since Java 7, the diamond operator (`<>`) is the preferred approach as it reduces redundancy - the compiler can infer the type from the left-hand side of the declaration. Both achieve the same result, but the diamond operator is more concise and follows modern Java conventions.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
      synchronized (players) {
        for (final Player player : players) {
          if (getJudge() == player) {
            continue;
          }
          final List<WhiteCard> cards = new ArrayList<>(newBlackCard.getDraw());
          for (int i = 0; i < newBlackCard.getDraw(); i++) {
            cards.add(getNextWhiteCard());
          }
          player.getHand().addAll(cards);
          sendCardsToPlayer(player, cards);

```
