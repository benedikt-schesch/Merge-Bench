Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same class `BinStorage` that implements `ReversibleLoadStoreFunc`. The only difference is that the right side (after the merge marker) adds three public static final byte constants (`RECORD_1`, `RECORD_2`, `RECORD_3`) before the instance variables.

Since both sides have the same class declaration and the right side simply adds additional constants that don't conflict with the existing code, the semantic intent is clear: we want the class with the additional constants.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.FrontendException;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.schema.Schema;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.schema.SchemaMergeException;
import org.apache.pig.impl.util.WrappedIOException;


public class BinStorage implements ReversibleLoadStoreFunc {
    public static final byte RECORD_1 = 0x21;
    public static final byte RECORD_2 = 0x31;
    public static final byte RECORD_3 = 0x41;

    Iterator<Tuple>     i              = null;
    protected BufferedPositionedInputStream in = null;
    private DataInputStream inData = null;
    protected long                end            = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    

```
