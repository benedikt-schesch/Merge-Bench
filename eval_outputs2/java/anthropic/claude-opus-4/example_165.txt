Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- The HEAD version uses `context.getDfs()`
- The incoming change uses `context.getFs()`

Both versions are trying to get a filesystem/data storage object from the context to pass to the overloaded `fileExists` method below. The conflict appears to be a simple API change where the method was likely renamed from `getDfs()` to `getFs()` (or vice versa).

Without more context about which is the correct current API method name, or whether this represents a legitimate API change that should be adopted, I cannot determine which version is semantically correct. The intent is clear (get the filesystem object), but the specific method name to use is ambiguous.

Therefore, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
        }
    }

    public static boolean fileExists(String filename, PigContext context)
            throws IOException {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        return fileExists(filename, context.getDfs());
=======
        return fileExists(filename, context.getFs());
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
    }

    public static boolean fileExists(String filename, DataStorage store)
            throws IOException {
        ElementDescriptor elem = store.asElement(filename);

```
