Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update a comment that references a field name. The conflict is about whether the field is named `spectator` (singular) or `spectators` (plural).

Given the context of the method `removeSpectator` which removes a spectator from the game, and the fact that games typically can have multiple spectators, the plural form `spectators` makes more semantic sense. This appears to be a simple rename refactoring where one branch updated the field name from singular to plural.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
  }

  /**
   * Remove a spectator from the game.
   * <br/>
   * Synchronizes on {@link #spectators}.
   *
   * @param user Spectator to remove from the game.
   */
  public void removeSpectator(final User user) {
    logger.info(String.format("Removing spectator %s from game %d.", user.toString(), id));

```
