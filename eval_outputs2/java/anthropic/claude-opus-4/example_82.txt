Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define a constructor for what appears to be a Black Card class, but with different class names and parameter names:

- HEAD: `CustomBlackCard` class with `watermark` parameter
- Other branch: `CardcastBlackCard` class with `deckId` parameter

The conflict seems to be about renaming/refactoring:
1. The class was renamed from `CustomBlackCard` to `CardcastBlackCard`
2. The last parameter was renamed from `watermark` to `deckId`

However, looking at the field declaration `private final String watermark;` and the assignment `this.watermark = watermark;` in the constructor body, it's clear that the field is still named `watermark`. This creates an inconsistency if we were to accept the `deckId` parameter name.

Since the field and assignment still use `watermark`, and without more context about whether the field was also meant to be renamed, I'll preserve the conflict as-is to avoid introducing a compilation error:

```java
  private final String text;
  private final int draw;
  private final int pick;
  private final String watermark;

<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/customsets/CustomBlackCard.java
  public CustomBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick, final String watermark) {
=======
  public CardcastBlackCard(final int id, final String text, final int draw, final int pick,
                           final String deckId) {
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a:src/main/java/net/socialgamer/cah/cardcast/CardcastBlackCard.java
    this.id = id;
    this.text = text;
    this.draw = draw;
    this.pick = pick;
    this.watermark = watermark;

```
