Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to add the exact same line:

```java
private transient final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());
```

The only difference is that the HEAD version has extra spaces at the end of the line, while the other branch has no trailing spaces. This is a trivial formatting difference with identical semantic intent - both sides want to add the same logger field declaration.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import org.apache.pig.impl.util.WrappedIOException;

public class PigContext implements Serializable, FunctionInstantiator {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    
    private transient final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());
    
    public static final String JOB_NAME = "jobName";
    public static final String JOB_NAME_PREFIX= "PigLatin";
    
    /* NOTE: we only serialize some of the stuff 

```
