Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): The method signature expects `String functionSpec` as the second parameter
- The incoming change: The method signature expects `FuncSpec functionSpec` as the second parameter

Looking at the method body, I can see that:
1. The code checks if `functionSpec` is null
2. It uses `functionSpec` directly in `definedFunctions.put(function, functionSpec)`
3. The comment above mentions "the FuncSpec object" which suggests the parameter should be of type `FuncSpec`, not `String`

Based on the semantic intent and the usage in the method body, the incoming change (using `FuncSpec functionSpec`) appears to be correct. The method body is already treating `functionSpec` as an object (checking for null and putting it directly into a map), not as a String.

```java
     * @param function - the new function alias to define.
     * @param functionSpec - the FuncSpec object representing the name of 
     * the function class and any arguments to constructor.
     * 
     */
    public void registerFunction(String function, FuncSpec functionSpec) {
        if (functionSpec == null) {
            definedFunctions.remove(function);
        } else {
            definedFunctions.put(function, functionSpec);
        }

```
