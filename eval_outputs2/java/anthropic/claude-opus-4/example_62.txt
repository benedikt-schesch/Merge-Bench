Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they both want to log the same message with the same parameters. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD version has the string split across multiple lines
- The other version has it on a single line

Since both versions are functionally identical and this appears to be just a formatting preference difference, I'll preserve the more compact single-line version as it's more concise and doesn't affect readability for this particular log message.

```java

    synchronized (playedCards) {
      if (state == GameState.PLAYING || playersToRemove.size() == 0) {
        // not sure how much of this check is actually required
        if (players.size() < 3 || playedCards.size() < 2) {
          logger.info(String.format("Resetting game %d due to insufficient players after removing %d idle players.", id, playersToRemove.size()));
          resetState(true);
        } else {
          judgingState();
        }
      }

```
