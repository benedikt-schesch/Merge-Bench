Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the semantic intent of both sides:

**HEAD side**: Implements `instantiateFuncFromSpec` by parsing the function spec string into class name and arguments, then calling `instantiateFunc` with these parsed components.

**Incoming side**: Implements `instantiateFuncFromSpec` by creating a `FuncSpec` object from the string and delegating to an overloaded version of the same method.

Both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - instantiating a function from a specification string - but using different approaches. The incoming side appears to be using a more object-oriented approach with a `FuncSpec` class that likely encapsulates the parsing logic.

Without seeing the full context of both implementations (like whether the overloaded `instantiateFuncFromSpec(FuncSpec)` method exists, or what `FuncSpec` does), I cannot definitively resolve this conflict as the architectural decision between these two approaches requires more context.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
            throw new RuntimeException(sb.toString(), e);
        }
        return ret;
    }
    
<<<<<<< HEAD

        return instantiateFunc(getClassNameFromSpec(funcSpec), getArgStringFromSpec(funcSpec));

        return instantiateFuncFromSpec(new FuncSpec(funcSpec));
