Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the semantic intent of both sides:

**HEAD (left side)**: Wants a concrete implementation of `start()` with no parameters
**Incoming change (right side)**: Wants an abstract method `start()` and introduces a new method `start(boolean checkWorlds)` with implementation

The semantic intent appears to be:
- The incoming change wants to make `start()` abstract (likely to force subclasses to implement it)
- The incoming change also introduces a parameterized version `start(boolean checkWorlds)` that contains the implementation
- Both sides want the logging functionality that follows

This seems like a refactoring where the implementation is being moved to the parameterized method while keeping the no-arg version abstract. The most semantically correct resolution would be to keep both method signatures from the incoming change.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
	@Override
	public String getAPIVersion() {
		return SpoutEngine.class.getPackage().getImplementationVersion();
	}

	public abstract void start();

	public void start(boolean checkWorlds) {
		Spout.info("Spout is starting in {0}-only mode.", getPlatform().name().toLowerCase());
		Spout.info("Current version is {0} (Implementing SpoutAPI {1}).", getVersion(), getAPIVersion());
		Spout.info("This software is currently in alpha status so components may");
		Spout.info("have bugs or not work at all. Please report any issues to");
		Spout.info("http://issues.spout.org");

```
