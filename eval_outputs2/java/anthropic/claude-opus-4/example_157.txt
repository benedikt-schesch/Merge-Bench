Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different import statements:

- HEAD wants to import `org.apache.pig.impl.io.FileLocalizer`
- The other branch wants to import `org.apache.pig.impl.PigImplConstants`

Since these are two different imports that serve different purposes and there's no semantic conflict between them (they're in different packages and likely serve different functionality), the resolution should include both imports. This is a common pattern in merge conflicts where different features or fixes require different imports.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import org.apache.pig.backend.executionengine.ExecException;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.datastorage.ConfigurationUtil;
import org.apache.pig.data.DataType;
import org.apache.pig.data.Tuple;
import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;
import org.apache.pig.impl.PigImplConstants;
import org.apache.pig.impl.io.FileLocalizer;
import org.apache.pig.impl.io.InterStorage;
import org.apache.pig.impl.io.ReadToEndLoader;
import org.apache.pig.impl.io.SequenceFileInterStorage;
import org.apache.pig.impl.io.TFileStorage;
import org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.schema.Schema;

```
