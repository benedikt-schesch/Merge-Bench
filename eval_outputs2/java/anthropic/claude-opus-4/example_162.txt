Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same method `isDistinct()`, but with different access modifiers:

- HEAD (current branch): `public abstract boolean isDistinct();`
- Incoming change: `boolean isDistinct();`

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both want to declare a method that checks if the bag is distinct. The difference is in the access level and whether it's explicitly marked as abstract.

In Java interfaces, methods are `public` and `abstract` by default, so both declarations are semantically equivalent if this is an interface. If this is an abstract class, the explicit modifiers would be necessary.

Given that both sides want the same method with the same signature and presumably the same intent, and considering that explicit modifiers make the code clearer and more maintainable, I'll resolve this by keeping the more explicit version from HEAD:

```java
    
    /**
     * Find out if the bag is distinct.
     */
    public abstract boolean isDistinct();
    
    /**
     * Get an iterator to the bag. For default and distinct bags,
     * no particular order is guaranteed. For sorted bags the order
     * is guaranteed to be sorted according
```
