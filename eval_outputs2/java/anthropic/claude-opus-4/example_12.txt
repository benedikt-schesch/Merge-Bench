Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - getting the meta plugin from Spout's plugin manager. The difference is:

- HEAD version: Direct call to `Spout.getPluginManager().getMetaPlugin()`
- Other version: Explicit cast to `PluginManager` before calling `getMetaPlugin()`

The intent is identical - both want to assign the meta plugin to the `plugin` variable. The cast in the second version suggests that at some point the return type of `Spout.getPluginManager()` might have been ambiguous or the `getMetaPlugin()` method might not have been directly accessible without the cast.

Without knowing the current API structure, I cannot definitively say which is correct. The conflict should be preserved for manual resolution by someone familiar with the current Spout API.

```java
	private final Map<Integer, Widget> spoutMessages = new HashMap<Integer, Widget>();
	// The hashmap that contains the plugin's debug messages
	private final Map<Plugin, Widget> messages = new HashMap<Plugin, Widget>();

	public DebugScreen() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		plugin = Spout.getPluginManager().getMetaPlugin();
=======
		plugin = ((PluginManager) Spout.getPluginManager()).getMetaPlugin();
>>>>>>> 67bcb76a96f358fc131320b0611ffaa3bf3678c2
		init();
	}

	@Override
	public void open() {
