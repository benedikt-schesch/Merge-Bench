Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - creating an ArrayList with an initial capacity of `cards.size()`. The only difference is:

- HEAD version: `new ArrayList<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>(cards.size())`
- Other version: `new ArrayList<>(cards.size())` (using diamond operator)

Both are semantically identical. The second version uses the diamond operator (`<>`) which was introduced in Java 7 to reduce verbosity by allowing type inference. Since the variable declaration already specifies the generic type `List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>`, the compiler can infer the type parameters for the ArrayList constructor.

The more modern and cleaner approach is to use the diamond operator, so I'll resolve in favor of the second version:

```java
   *
   * @param cards Cards to convert to client data.
   * @return Client representation of {@code cards}.
   */
  private List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>> getWhiteCardData(final List<WhiteCard> cards) {
    final List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>> data = new ArrayList<>(cards.size());
    for (final WhiteCard card : cards) {
      data.add(card.getClientData());
    }
    return data;
  }

```
