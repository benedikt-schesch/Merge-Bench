Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the same method signature, but with different parameters:

- HEAD version: removes the `commandName` parameter
- Other version: keeps the `commandName` parameter

Since the first method in the context (the one that creates a `UsagePrinter`) includes the `commandName` parameter, and it's calling this conflicted method, it seems the intent is to keep the `commandName` parameter for consistency.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, String commandName, CommandMetadata command, StringBuilder out)
    {
        usage(programName, groupName, commandName, command, new UsagePrinter(out, columnSize));
    }

    public void usage(@Nullable String programName, @Nullable String groupName, String commandName, CommandMetadata command, UsagePrinter out)
    {
        //
        // NAME
        //
        out.append("NAME").newline();


```
