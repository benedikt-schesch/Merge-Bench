Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - they're both implementing the `isNotEqualTo` method. The only difference is a formatting preference: whether to have a space before the opening brace `{`.

The version with the space (`byte expected) {`) appears to be the more common Java formatting convention and matches what we see in the previous method. Since both sides have the same semantic intent and the difference is purely stylistic, I'll resolve this by choosing the more conventional formatting:

```java
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

  public ByteAssert isNotEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
