Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - converting players to an array and creating a list of users. The differences are:

1. **HEAD**: Uses `new Player[players.size()]` for the array creation
2. **Branch**: Uses `new Player[0]` for the array creation and removes the explicit type parameter from ArrayList (using diamond operator `<>`)

The semantic intent is the same, but the branch version uses more modern Java practices:
- `new Player[0]` is actually preferred in modern Java as it can be more performant than pre-sizing the array
- The diamond operator `<>` is cleaner and follows modern Java style guidelines

Here's the resolved version using the more modern approach from the branch:

```java
  /**
   * @return A list of all {@code User}s in this game.
   */
  private List<User> playersToUsers() {
    final List<User> users;
    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    users = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      users.add(player.getUser());
    }
    synchronized (spectators) {
      users.addAll(spectators);

```
