Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Includes `import java.io.OutputStream;`
- **Incoming branch** (0ae7f1d024767140d97e8f17fbf35dec14a4b384): Does not include `import java.io.OutputStream;`

This appears to be a simple additive change where the HEAD branch added an import statement that wasn't present in the incoming branch. Since import statements are typically added when they're needed in the code, and removing an import that's in use would cause compilation errors, the semantic intent here is most likely to keep the import.

The resolved code should include the `OutputStream` import to preserve the functionality that required it in the HEAD branch.

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.io.SequenceInputStream;
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.SocketException;
import java.net.SocketImplFactory;
```
