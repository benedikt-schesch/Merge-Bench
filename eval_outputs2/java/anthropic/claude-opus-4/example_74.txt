Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add a service provider field, but with different names:

- HEAD wants: `customDecksServiceProvider` of type `CustomCardsService`
- The incoming branch wants: `cardcastServiceProvider` of type `CardcastService`

These appear to be two different services with different purposes, not a simple rename. Without more context about the intent behind each change, it's ambiguous whether:
1. Both services should coexist
2. One service is replacing the other
3. They serve the same purpose with different implementations

Since I cannot determine the semantic intent with certainty, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
  /**
   * Lock to prevent missing timer updates.
   */
  private final Object roundTimerLock = new Object();
  private final ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor globalTimer;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private final Provider<CustomCardsService> customDecksServiceProvider;
=======
  private final Provider<CardcastService> cardcastServiceProvider;
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
  private final Provider<String> uniqueIdProvider;
  private Player host;
  private BlackDeck blackDeck;
  private BlackCard blackCard;
  private WhiteDeck whiteDeck;
```
