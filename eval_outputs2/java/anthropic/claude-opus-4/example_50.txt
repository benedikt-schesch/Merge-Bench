Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - initialize a TreeSet with an array of string values. The differences are:

1. **HEAD**: Uses `new TreeSet<String>` with explicit type parameter and `new String[]{}` array initialization
2. **Incoming**: Uses `new TreeSet<>` with diamond operator (Java 7+) and varargs without explicit array creation

The incoming change represents more modern Java syntax (diamond operator and simplified array initialization), while maintaining the exact same functionality. Since both achieve the same semantic intent but the incoming version uses cleaner, more modern syntax, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```java
  private final static int JUDGE_TIMEOUT_PER_CARD = 7 * 1000;
  private final static int MAX_SKIPS_BEFORE_KICK = 2;
  private final static Set<String> FINITE_PLAYTIMES;

  static {
    final Set<String> finitePlaytimes = new TreeSet<>(Arrays.asList("0.25x", "0.5x", "0.75x", "1x", "1.25x", "1.5x", "1.75x", "2x", "2.5x", "3x", "4x", "5x", "10x"));
    FINITE_PLAYTIMES = Collections.unmodifiableSet(finitePlaytimes);
  }

  private final int id;
  /**
