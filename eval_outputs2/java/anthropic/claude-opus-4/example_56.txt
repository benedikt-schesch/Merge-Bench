Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to execute the same query but with different formatting:

- HEAD version: Multi-line formatting with method calls on separate lines
- Branch version: Single-line formatting with all method calls chained on one line

Both versions are semantically identical - they create the same query to fetch PyxCardSet objects by IDs. The only difference is the code formatting style.

Since both achieve the same intent and there's no semantic difference, I'll preserve the HEAD version as it follows a more readable multi-line formatting style:

```java
    synchronized (options.cardSetIds) {
      try {
        final List<CardSet> cardSets = new ArrayList<>();

        if (!options.getPyxCardSetIds().isEmpty()) {
          @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") final List<CardSet> pyxCardSets = session
              .createQuery("from PyxCardSet where id in (:ids)")
              .setParameterList("ids", options.getPyxCardSetIds()).list();
          cardSets.addAll(pyxCardSets);
        }

        // Not injecting the service itself because we might need to assisted inject it later
        // with card id stuff.

```
