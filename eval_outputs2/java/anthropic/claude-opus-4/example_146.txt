Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Uses `protected` access modifier for the `empty` static field
- **Incoming change**: Uses `private` access modifier for the `empty` static field

Both sides agree that `empty` should be a static field of type `Result`, but they differ on the access modifier. 

To resolve this semantically, I need to consider:
1. The field is `static` and appears to be a constant (never modified)
2. It's a utility/sentinel value for representing null results
3. The choice is between `protected` (accessible to subclasses) vs `private` (only accessible within this class)

Without additional context about whether subclasses need access to this `empty` result, and given that this appears to be an internal implementation detail (a null result constant), the more restrictive `private` access modifier is generally preferred following the principle of least privilege.

However, since the HEAD branch specifically chose `protected`, there may be subclasses that need access to this field.

Given the ambiguity about the intent and whether subclasses require access to this field, I should preserve the conflict for manual resolution:

```java
 *
 */
public class POStore extends PhysicalOperator {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    protected static Result empty = new Result(POStatus.STATUS_NULL, null);
=======
    private static Result empty = new Result(POStatus.STATUS_NULL, null);
>>>>>>> 5e2f75cb9f2d357f135a4cb3d2f905fb78fa9d40
    transient private StoreFuncInterface storer;
    transient private POStoreImpl impl;
    transient private String counterName = null;
    private FileSpec sFile;
    private Schema schema;
