Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the conflict is about whether to include the `import java.util.List;` statement.

From the context:
- HEAD (current branch) does not have the `import java.util.List;` statement
- The incoming branch (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309) adds the `import java.util.List;` statement

Since we already have `import java.util.ArrayList;` (which is a concrete implementation of List), and there's no visible usage of the List interface in the provided context, it's ambiguous whether the List import is actually needed. The intent could be:
1. The incoming branch needs List for some code changes not shown in this snippet
2. It was added unnecessarily 
3. There's a refactoring happening to use List interface instead of ArrayList

Without seeing the actual usage of List in the code, I cannot determine the correct resolution with certainty.

```java
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;
