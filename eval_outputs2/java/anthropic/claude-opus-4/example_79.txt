Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same method signature for `getString()` in an interface. The only difference is:

- HEAD version: includes the `public` modifier
- Other version: omits the `public` modifier

In Java interfaces, all methods are implicitly `public abstract`, so the `public` modifier is redundant and not necessary. Modern Java style guides typically recommend omitting redundant modifiers in interfaces for cleaner code.

Since both versions are semantically identical and the version without `public` follows more modern Java conventions, I'll resolve by using the cleaner version:

```java
   */
  public interface Localizable {
    /**
     * @return The user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     */
    String getString();
  }

  /**
   * Enums that implement this interface have two user-visible strings associated with them.
   * <p>

```
