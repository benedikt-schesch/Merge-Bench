Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add code after the `addAsyncManager` call, but they're adding different functionality:

- HEAD: Continues directly to the threshold warning logic
- The incoming branch: Adds a conditional check to start a mesh generator thread if running on the client platform

Both changes appear to be intentional additions that serve different purposes and don't conflict semantically. The incoming change adds client-specific initialization logic, while the existing code handles region count warnings. These can coexist.

Here's the resolved version:

```java
		if (current != null) {
			return current;
		}
		
		((SpoutScheduler)Spout.getScheduler()).addAsyncManager(region);

		if (Spout.getEngine().getPlatform() == Platform.CLIENT) {
			region.startMeshGeneratorThread();
		}

		int threshold = warnThreshold.get();
		if (regionsLoaded.getAndIncrement() > threshold) {
			Spout.getLogger().info("Warning: number of spout regions exceeds " + threshold + " when creating (" +
                x + ", " + y + ", " + z + ")");

```
