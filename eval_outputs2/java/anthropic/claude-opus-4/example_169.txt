Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Has just the `LOCAL_PREFIX` constant
- **Incoming change (commit 1488b22...)**: Adds two new constants `STYLE_UNIX` and `STYLE_WINDOWS` with values 0 and 1

The intent appears to be adding new functionality related to file system styles (Unix vs Windows) while preserving the existing `LOCAL_PREFIX` constant. There's no semantic conflict here - these are just additional constants being added that don't interfere with the existing code.

The resolved version should include both the existing constant and the new constants:

```java

public class FileLocalizer {
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(FileLocalizer.class);
    
    static public final String LOCAL_PREFIX  = "file:";
    static public final int STYLE_UNIX = 0;
    static public final int STYLE_WINDOWS = 1;

    public static class DataStorageInputStreamIterator extends InputStream {
        InputStream current;
        ElementDescriptor[] elements;
        int currentElement;

```
