Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to import `org.junit.*` while the other branch (06e86330876dee7fcb1356794176b04a7161cf65) wants to remove that import.

Given the context:
1. This is a test class (as indicated by the javadoc mentioning "Tests for...")
2. The file already imports test-related classes from org.fest
3. The import statement is between other imports and the class javadoc

Without seeing the rest of the file, it's difficult to determine if JUnit imports are actually needed. Since I cannot be certain about the intent (whether the code uses JUnit annotations or assertions), I should preserve the conflict as requested.

```java

import org.fest.assertions.api.AbstractAssert;

import org.fest.assertions.description.Description;
import org.fest.test.ExpectedException;
<<<<<<< HEAD
