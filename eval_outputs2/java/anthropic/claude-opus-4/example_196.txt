Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - getting a class name either from a `funcSpec` object or from the `alias` string when `funcSpec` is null.

The conflict appears to be about which method to use:
- HEAD version uses `getClassNameFromSpec()` for both cases
- The other branch uses `funcSpec.getClassName()` when funcSpec exists, and `FuncSpec.getClassNameFromSpec(alias)` when it doesn't

Since the second branch makes a distinction between instance method (`funcSpec.getClassName()`) and static method (`FuncSpec.getClassNameFromSpec(alias)`), and this seems more semantically correct (using an instance method when we have an instance, and a static method when we don't), I'll resolve in favor of the second branch's approach:

```java
        if (definedFunctions != null) {
            funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias);
        }
        if (funcSpec != null) {
            className = funcSpec.getClassName();
        }else{
            className = FuncSpec.getClassNameFromSpec(alias);
        }
        return resolveClassName(className);
    }
  
    public Object instantiateFuncFromAlias(String alias) throws IOException {
```
