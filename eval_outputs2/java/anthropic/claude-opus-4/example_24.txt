Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Wants to import `SpoutServer` and `SpoutServerWorld` classes from the `org.spout.engine` package
- **Incoming change (67bcb76...)**: Wants to remove these imports (or they were never added in that branch)

Without more context about how these imports are used in the rest of the file, I cannot determine which resolution is semantically correct. The imports might be:
1. Necessary for code elsewhere in the file (should keep them)
2. Unused/removed in a cleanup effort (should remove them)
3. Part of a refactoring where the functionality was moved elsewhere

Since I cannot determine the intent with certainty, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java

import org.spout.nbt.stream.NBTInputStream;
import org.spout.nbt.stream.NBTOutputStream;
