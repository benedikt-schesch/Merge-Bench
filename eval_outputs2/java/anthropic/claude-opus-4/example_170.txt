Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to document the same method `openDFSFile`. The conflict is in the JavaDoc comments:

- HEAD has a multi-line comment that describes the function's purpose
- The incoming change (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309) has the same description on a single line, plus additional JavaDoc tags (@param and @return, @throws)

The semantic intent is clear: both sides want to document what the function does, but the incoming change provides more complete JavaDoc documentation with parameter descriptions and return/exception information. This is clearly an improvement over just the description alone.

Here's the resolved version:

```java
            return fileSpec;
        return (execType == ExecType.LOCAL ? LOCAL_PREFIX : "") + fileSpec;
    }

    /**
     * This function is meant to be used if the mappers/reducers want to access any HDFS file
     * @param fileName
     * @return InputStream of the open file.
     * @throws IOException
     */
    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        SliceWrapper wrapper = PigInputFormat.getActiveSplit();

        if (wrapper == null)

```
