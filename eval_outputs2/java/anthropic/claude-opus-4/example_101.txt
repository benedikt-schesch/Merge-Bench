Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they're both implementing the `isEqualTo` method with identical signatures and implementations. The only difference is a formatting issue: HEAD has no space before the opening brace `{`, while the other branch has a space before it.

Since both sides have the same intent and functionality, I'll resolve this by choosing the version with better formatting (with the space before the brace), which is more consistent with common Java style guidelines.

```java

  protected LongAssert(Long actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, LongAssert.class, description);
  }

  public LongAssert isEqualTo(long expected) {
    longs.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }


```
