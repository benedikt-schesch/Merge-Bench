Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

**HEAD (left side):**
- Declares `snapshotManager` as `protected final`
- Only includes the snapshotManager declaration

**Incoming changes (right side):**
- Declares `snapshotManager` as `private final`
- Adds three additional field declarations:
  - `players` (protected final SnapshotableLinkedHashMap)
  - `defaultGenerator` (private final WorldGenerator)
  - `sessions` (protected final SpoutSessionRegistry)

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to declare the `snapshotManager` field
2. The incoming changes want to add additional fields that seem to be core components of the system
3. The visibility modifier conflict (`protected` vs `private`) needs resolution

Since the incoming changes include the `players` field which uses `snapshotManager` in its initialization, and this field is `protected`, it makes semantic sense to keep `snapshotManager` as `protected` to maintain consistency in visibility for related fields.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
	private final PluginManager pluginManager = new PluginManager(this, securityManager, 0.0);
	private final ConsoleManager consoleManager;
	private final EventManager eventManager = new SimpleEventManager();
	private final RecipeManager recipeManager = new SimpleRecipeManager();
	private final ServiceManager serviceManager = new ServiceManager();
	protected final SnapshotManager snapshotManager = new SnapshotManager();
	protected final SnapshotableLinkedHashMap<String, SpoutPlayer> players = new SnapshotableLinkedHashMap<String, SpoutPlayer>(snapshotManager);
	private final WorldGenerator defaultGenerator = new EmptyWorldGenerator();
	protected final SpoutSessionRegistry sessions = new SpoutSessionRegistry();
	protected final SpoutScheduler scheduler = new SpoutScheduler(this);
	protected final SpoutParallelTaskManager parallelTaskManager = new SpoutParallelTaskManager(this);
	private final AtomicBoolean setupComplete = new AtomicBoolean(false);
	private final SpoutConfiguration config = new SpoutConfiguration();
	private final SpoutInputConfiguration inputConfig = new SpoutInputConfiguration();

```
