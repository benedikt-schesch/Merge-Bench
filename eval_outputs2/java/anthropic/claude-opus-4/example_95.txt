Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

1. **HEAD (current branch)**: Creates a new Game with specific parameters, ending with `formatProvider`
2. **Incoming branch**: Creates a new Game with the same parameters plus two additional ones: another `falseProvider` and `gameOptionsProvider`

The conflict appears to be about the constructor signature for the `Game` class. The incoming branch seems to have an updated constructor that requires two additional parameters compared to HEAD.

Since the incoming branch has more parameters, it likely represents a newer version of the code where the Game constructor has been updated to accept additional configuration. The semantic intent is to create a new Game instance with ID 1, and the incoming branch provides the complete set of required parameters for the updated constructor.

Therefore, I'll resolve this by accepting the incoming branch's version which includes all necessary parameters:

```java

    // remove game 1 out from under it, to make sure it'll fix itself
    gameManager.getGames().remove(1);
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
    gameManager.getGames().put(1,
        new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));
    assertEquals(-1, gameManager.get().intValue());

    gameManager.destroyGame(2);
    gameManager.destroyGame(0);
    assertEquals(2, gameManager.get().intValue());

```
