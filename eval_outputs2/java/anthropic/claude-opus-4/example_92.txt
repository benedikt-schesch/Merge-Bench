Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the `handle` method but with different changes:

- **HEAD**: Changes the HashMap initialization to use diamond operator (`<>`) for type inference
- **Current branch (ed08e371...)**: Adds a new line `ret.put(AjaxResponse.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED, gameChatEnabled);` and keeps the explicit type parameters in HashMap

Both changes are semantically compatible - one is modernizing the code style while the other is adding new functionality. The resolution should include both improvements.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    this.userPermalinkFormatString = userPermalinkFormatString;
  }

  @Override
  public Map<ReturnableData, Object> handle(final RequestWrapper request,
                                            final HttpSession session) {
    final HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> ret = new HashMap<>();
    ret.put(AjaxResponse.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED, gameChatEnabled);
    ret.put(AjaxResponse.GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED, globalChatEnabled);

    if (banList.contains(request.getRemoteAddr())) {
      LOG.info(String.format("Rejecting user from %s because they are banned.",
              request.getRemoteAddr()));

```
