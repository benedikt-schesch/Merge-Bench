Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

**HEAD (current branch):**
- Unthrottles the connection for the address
- Selects the appropriate Gson instance based on the protocol version (legacy for 1.7.2, regular otherwise)

**Incoming change:**
- Simply uses the regular Gson instance

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants to maintain backward compatibility with Minecraft 1.7.2 by using a legacy Gson instance when needed, and also includes connection throttling logic
- The incoming change simplifies by always using the regular Gson instance

Since the HEAD version includes more functionality (connection unthrottling) and maintains backward compatibility, it seems the more complete solution. The incoming change appears to be removing the protocol version check, possibly because 1.7.2 support is being dropped or the code was simplified without considering this edge case.

Given that the HEAD version preserves more functionality and handles more cases, I'll resolve in favor of HEAD:

```java
                Callback<ProxyPingEvent> callback = new Callback<ProxyPingEvent>()
                {
                    @Override
                    public void done(ProxyPingEvent pingResult, Throwable error)
                    {
                        BungeeCord.getInstance().getConnectionThrottle().unthrottle( getAddress().getAddress() );
                        Gson gson = handshake.getProtocolVersion() == ProtocolConstants.MINECRAFT_1_7_2 ? BungeeCord.getInstance().gsonLegacy : BungeeCord.getInstance().gson;
                        unsafe.sendPacket( new StatusResponse( gson.toJson( pingResult.getResponse() ) ) );
                    }
                };

                bungee.getPluginManager().callEvent( new ProxyPingEvent( InitialHandler.this, result, callback ) );

```
