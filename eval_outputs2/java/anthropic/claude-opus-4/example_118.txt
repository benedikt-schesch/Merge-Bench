Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - they both want to call `loadArguments()` after `super.onCreate()`. The difference is that the right side (e3fe61199a31f30ef026d62e2799dcebe5d944f2) adds additional functionality with a conditional check and method call.

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides agree that `loadArguments()` should be called
2. The right side adds new functionality to conditionally execute a request on startup

Since both sides want `loadArguments()` and the right side adds non-conflicting additional functionality, the resolution should include both changes.

```java
    private boolean fromPaginated;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        loadArguments();
        if (autoStart()) {
            executeRequest();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreateView(inflater, container, savedInstanceState);

```
