Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to create a HashMap, but with slightly different syntax:

- HEAD uses the older Java syntax: `new HashMap<ReturnableData, Object>()`
- The other branch uses the diamond operator syntax: `new HashMap<>()` which was introduced in Java 7

Both achieve the same result - the diamond operator is just a more concise way to write the same thing, as the type parameters are inferred from the variable declaration.

Since the diamond operator is the more modern and preferred approach in Java (reducing redundancy), I'll resolve this by using the cleaner syntax:

```java

  /**
   * @return A HashMap to use for events dispatched from this game, with the game id already set.
   */
  public HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> getEventMap() {
    final HashMap<ReturnableData, Object> data = new HashMap<>();
    data.put(LongPollResponse.GAME_ID, id);
    return data;
  }

  /**
