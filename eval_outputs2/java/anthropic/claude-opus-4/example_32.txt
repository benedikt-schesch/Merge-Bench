Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import Vector3, but from different packages:

- HEAD is importing from `org.spout.math.vector.Vector3`
- The other branch is importing from `org.spout.api.math.Vector3`

Additionally, the other branch is also importing `org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk`.

Based on the context (this is in the `org.spout.api.util.cuboid` package), it seems the other branch is using the API-based imports which is more consistent with the package structure. The HEAD version appears to be using a different math library location.

Here's the resolved version that keeps both the Chunk import and uses the API-consistent Vector3 import:

```java
 * License and see <http://spout.in/licensev1> for the full license, including
 * the MIT license.
 */
package org.spout.api.util.cuboid;

import org.spout.api.geo.cuboid.Chunk;
import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;

/**
 * This class implements a Cuboid common methods for a one dimensional array Cuboid Buffer
 *
 * Elements are stored in column order and each column is +1 on the Z dimension relative to the previous one.

```
