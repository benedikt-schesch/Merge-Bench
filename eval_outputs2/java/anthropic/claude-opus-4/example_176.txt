Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import classes related to Pig's MapReduce functionality, but they're referencing different package paths.

The HEAD branch imports:
- `org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapreduceExec.PigMapReduce`

The incoming branch (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309) imports:
- `org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.PigMapReduce`

The incoming branch also comments out the old import path, suggesting this is likely a refactoring where the PigMapReduce class was moved from the `mapreduceExec` package to the `mapReduceLayer` package.

Based on the semantic intent, the incoming changes appear to be updating to a new package structure. The fact that the old import is commented out rather than deleted suggests this was an intentional migration.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import java.util.jar.JarEntry;
import java.util.jar.JarInputStream;
import java.util.jar.JarOutputStream;
import java.util.zip.ZipEntry;

//import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapreduceExec.PigMapReduce;
import org.apache.pig.impl.PigContext;
import org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.PigMapReduce;


public class JarManager {
