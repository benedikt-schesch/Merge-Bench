Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - they're both implementing the same `isEqualTo` method. The only difference is a formatting detail:

- HEAD version: No space before the opening brace `{`
- Other version: Has a space before the opening brace `{`

Since both implementations are functionally identical and the difference is purely stylistic, I'll choose the version with the space before the brace as it follows more common Java formatting conventions.

```java

  protected ByteAssert(Byte actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ByteAssert.class, description);
  }

  public ByteAssert isEqualTo(byte expected) {
    bytes.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }


```
