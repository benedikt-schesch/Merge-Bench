Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to create a `GruntParser` object, but they differ in the constructor arguments:

- HEAD version: `new GruntParser(new StringReader(script))`
- Incoming version: `new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig)`

The semantic intent appears to be that the incoming change is adding an additional parameter `myPig` to the GruntParser constructor. This is likely an API change where the GruntParser now requires or accepts a Pig instance as a second parameter.

Since this appears to be an intentional API enhancement rather than a conflicting change, the resolution should accept the incoming version with the additional `myPig` parameter.

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "explain b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
