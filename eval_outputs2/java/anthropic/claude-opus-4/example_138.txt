Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle spacing/formatting between the `LOG` declaration and the `mapStores` field declaration. 

The HEAD version has a blank line with trailing whitespace, while the incoming change has a completely empty line. Since this is just a formatting difference and both sides have the same semantic intent (adding a blank line between the LOG declaration and the field declarations), I'll resolve this by using the cleaner version without trailing whitespace.

```java

    // currently counters are not working in local mode - see PIG-1286
    public static final String SUCCESS_HEADER_LOCAL = "JobId\tAlias\tFeature\tOutputs";

    private static final Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(MRJobStats.class);

    private List<POStore> mapStores = null;

    private List<POStore> reduceStores = null;

    private List<FileSpec> loads = null;

```
