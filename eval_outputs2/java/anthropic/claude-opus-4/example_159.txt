Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Adds a new method `randomizeFileLocalizer()` that sets a random seed for FileLocalizer
- **f52ad1d45** (incoming branch): Removes this method entirely (or never had it)

The conflict appears to be about whether to include the `randomizeFileLocalizer()` method. Since the incoming branch doesn't have this method and there's no indication that it was intentionally removed (it's more likely it was never added in that branch), while HEAD explicitly adds it, the semantic intent seems to be that HEAD wants this functionality.

Given that:
1. The method appears to be a utility for randomization
2. It doesn't conflict with any other code
3. HEAD intentionally adds this functionality
4. The incoming branch simply doesn't have it (rather than explicitly removing it)

The resolution should keep the method from HEAD:

```java
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public void randomizeFileLocalizer(){
        FileLocalizer.setR(new Random());
    }

    /**
     * Used to get the compiled plan
     * @return map reduce plan built by the compiler
     */
    public MROperPlan getMRPlan() {
```
