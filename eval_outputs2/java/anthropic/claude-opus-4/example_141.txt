Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the same method signature and implementation, but with different changes:

- **HEAD**: Changes the parameter type from `MiniCluster` to `MiniGenericCluster` and reformats the method signature
- **Other branch**: Adds Windows path handling logic to convert backslashes to forward slashes

Both changes appear to be intentional and compatible - one is updating the type system while the other is adding platform-specific path handling. The semantic intent is to both modernize the API (with the new cluster type) and improve cross-platform compatibility.

Here's the resolved conflict that incorporates both changes:

```java
	 * @param cluster a reference to the minicluster
	 * @param localFileName the pathname of local file
	 * @param fileNameOnCluster the name with which the file should be created on the minicluster
	 * @throws IOException
	 */
     static public void copyFromLocalToCluster(MiniGenericCluster cluster,
        String localFileName, String fileNameOnCluster) throws IOException {
        if(Util.WINDOWS){
            localFileName = localFileName.replace('\\','/');
            fileNameOnCluster = fileNameOnCluster.replace('\\','/');
        }
        PigServer ps = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE, cluster.getProperties());
        String script = getMkDirCommandForHadoop2_0(fileNameOnCluster) + "fs -put " + localFileName + " " + fileNameOnCluster;

	    GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));
        parser.setInteractive(false);
