Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- HEAD version: `GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script));`
- Incoming change: `GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);`

The conflict is about whether the GruntParser constructor should take one parameter (just the StringReader) or two parameters (StringReader and myPig).

The incoming change adds a `myPig` parameter to the constructor. This suggests that the GruntParser now requires a reference to a Pig instance, likely for better integration or to access Pig-specific functionality. This is a common pattern where parsers need access to the context they're operating in.

Since the incoming change appears to be adding necessary functionality (passing the Pig instance to the parser), and this would be a breaking change if not included, the semantic intent seems to be that the parser now requires this additional parameter to function correctly.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
                          + "using PigStorage(':') as (uname:chararray, passwd:chararray, uid:int,gid:int);"
                          + "b = filter a by uid > 5;"
                          + "dump b;"
                          + "store b into '/tmp/output1';\n";

            GruntParser parser = new GruntParser(new StringReader(script), myPig);
            parser.setInteractive(false);
            parser.parseStopOnError();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
