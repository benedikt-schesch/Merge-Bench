Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same code but with slightly different approaches:

- **HEAD** uses `new User[spectators.size()]` and `new ArrayList<String>(spectatorsCopy.length)`
- **Incoming** uses `new User[0]` and `new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length)` with diamond operator

The semantic intent of both sides is the same - to create an array of spectators and then a list of their nicknames. The differences are:

1. `new User[spectators.size()]` vs `new User[0]` - Both work correctly with `toArray()`, but `new User[0]` is actually the preferred modern Java approach as it can be more performant
2. `new ArrayList<String>()` vs `new ArrayList<>()` - The diamond operator (`<>`) is the modern Java syntax (Java 7+) that infers the type

Since both changes appear to be modernization efforts and the incoming change uses more modern Java conventions consistently, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change:

```java
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      playerNames.add(player.getUser().getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.PLAYERS, playerNames);

    final User[] spectatorsCopy = spectators.toArray(new User[0]);
    final List<String> spectatorNames = new ArrayList<>(spectatorsCopy.length);
    for (final User spectator : spectatorsCopy) {
      spectatorNames.add(spectator.getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.SPECTATORS, spectatorNames);
