Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the constructor parameters, but with different formatting and content:

- HEAD version: Uses consistent indentation and only has the `ConnectedUsers users` parameter
- The other branch: Adds an additional parameter `@GameChatEnabled final boolean gameChatEnabled` but uses different indentation

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to keep the `ConnectedUsers users` parameter
2. The other branch wants to add the `gameChatEnabled` parameter with its annotation
3. HEAD seems to prefer a specific indentation style

Since the constructor body already expects `gameChatEnabled` (as shown by `this.gameChatEnabled = gameChatEnabled;`), the semantic resolution should include both parameters while maintaining consistent formatting:

```java
  private final ConnectedUsers users;
  private final boolean gameChatEnabled;

  @Inject
  public GameChatHandler(final GameManager gameManager, final ChatFilter chatFilter,
                         final ConnectedUsers users, @GameChatEnabled final boolean gameChatEnabled) {
    super(gameManager);
    this.chatFilter = chatFilter;
    this.users = users;
    this.gameChatEnabled = gameChatEnabled;
  }

```
