Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are calling the same `metrics.gameStart()` method with identical parameters. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD version: Multi-line formatting with parameters on separate lines
- Incoming version: Single-line formatting

Since both versions are semantically identical (same method call, same parameters in the same order), I'll preserve the HEAD version's multi-line formatting as it's generally more readable for method calls with many parameters.

```java
        synchronized (options.cardSetIds) {
          cardSets = loadCardSets(session);
          blackDeck = loadBlackDeck(cardSets);
          whiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
        }
        metrics.gameStart(currentUniqueId, cardSets, options.blanksInDeck, options.playerLimit,
            options.scoreGoal, !StringUtils.isBlank(options.password));
        startNextRound();
        gameManager.broadcastGameListRefresh();
      }
      return started;
    } finally {
```
