Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that HEAD has some whitespace/empty lines while the other branch (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309) has no content in that section. The conflict appears to be about whether to include empty lines between the closing brace of one method and the start of the next method (`getVersionString`).

Since this is purely a formatting/whitespace difference with no semantic changes, I'll resolve this by choosing the cleaner option without the extra empty lines:

```java
                                paramFiles.size() > 0 ? paramFiles.toArray(type2) : null);
        return new BufferedReader(new StringReader(writer.toString()));
    }
}
    
private static String getVersionString() {
	String findContainingJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(Main.class);
	  try { 
		  StringBuffer buffer = new  StringBuffer();
          JarFile jar = new JarFile(findContainingJar); 

```
