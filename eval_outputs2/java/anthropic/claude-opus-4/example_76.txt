Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they're both putting the same data into the map with the same key and value. The only difference is the formatting:

- HEAD has the code split across two lines
- The other branch has it on a single line

Since both versions are semantically identical and achieve the same intent, I'll resolve this by choosing the more readable two-line format from HEAD:

```java
   *
   * @param data A map of data being returned to a client request.
   */
  public void maybeAddPermalinkToData(final Map<ReturnableData, Object> data) {
    if (showGameLinkProvider.get() && null != currentUniqueId) {
      data.put(AjaxResponse.GAME_PERMALINK,
          String.format(gamePermalinkFormatProvider.get(), currentUniqueId));
    }
  }

  /**
   * Add a player to the game.

```
