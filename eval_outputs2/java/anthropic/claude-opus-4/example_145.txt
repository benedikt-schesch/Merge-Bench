Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has added two imports:
- `org.apache.hadoop.filecache.DistributedCache`
- `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileStatus`

While the other branch (0ae7f1d024767140d97e8f17fbf35dec14a4b384) has removed these imports or never had them.

Since this is just an import section and both sides have different views on what imports are needed, I cannot determine the semantic intent without seeing how these classes are used in the rest of the code. The safe approach is to preserve the conflict as-is so that a developer can make an informed decision based on the actual usage of these classes in the code.

```java
import java.util.Properties;

import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;
import org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration;
<<<<<<< HEAD
import org.apache.hadoop.filecache.DistributedCache;
