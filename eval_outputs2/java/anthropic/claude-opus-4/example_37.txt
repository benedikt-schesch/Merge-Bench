Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import different static methods from the `io.airlift.command` package:
- HEAD wants: `import static io.airlift.command.Cli.buildCli;`
- The other branch wants: `import static io.airlift.command.SingleCommand.singleCommand;`

Since this is a test class (`HelpTest`) and without seeing the actual test methods that would use these imports, I cannot determine which import is actually needed or if both are needed. The semantic intent is ambiguous without the context of what the test methods are trying to achieve.

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
import io.airlift.command.command.CommandRemove;

import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

<<<<<<< HEAD
import static io.airlift.command.Cli.buildCli;
=======
import static io.airlift.command.SingleCommand.singleCommand;
>>>>>>> a647950590fa8dec1925101321699283f22a8bff

@Test
public class HelpTest
{
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
