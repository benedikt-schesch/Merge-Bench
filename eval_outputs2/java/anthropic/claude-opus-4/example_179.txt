Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has removed the import for `org.apache.pig.impl.plan.OperatorKey`, while the other branch (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309) has kept it.

Without seeing how `OperatorKey` is used in the rest of the code, I cannot determine whether this import is needed or not. The intent is ambiguous - one side may have refactored to remove the dependency on `OperatorKey`, while the other side may still require it.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
import java.util.Map;
