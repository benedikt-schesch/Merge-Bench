Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to initialize the same `ArrayList`, but with slightly different syntax:

- **HEAD**: Uses explicit type parameter in the constructor: `new ArrayList<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>>(playedCards.size())`
- **Branch**: Uses the diamond operator (Java 7+): `new ArrayList<>(playedCards.size())`

Both achieve the same semantic intent - creating an ArrayList with an initial capacity of `playedCards.size()`. The branch version uses the more modern Java diamond operator syntax which infers the type from the declaration.

Since both versions are functionally identical and the diamond operator is the more modern/preferred approach in Java 7+, I'll resolve this by using the branch version:

```java
    } else {
      // getPlayerForUser synchronizes on players. This has caused a deadlock in the past.
      // Good idea to not nest synchronizes if possible anyway.
      final Player player = getPlayerForUser(user);
      synchronized (playedCards) {
        final List<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>> cardData = new ArrayList<>(playedCards.size());
        int faceDownCards = playedCards.size();
        if (playedCards.hasPlayer(player)) {
          cardData.add(getWhiteCardData(playedCards.getCards(player)));
          faceDownCards--;
        }

```
