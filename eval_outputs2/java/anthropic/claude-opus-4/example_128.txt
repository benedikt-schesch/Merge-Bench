Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the same class, with two main differences:

1. The `languages` array: HEAD has 6 languages, while the other branch adds "tr" (Turkish) as a 7th language
2. The constructor: HEAD uses `@Inject` annotation and has 4 parameters, while the other branch has no `@Inject` and adds a 5th parameter `ConfigDetectorDialog configDetectorDialog`

Based on the semantic intent:
- Both sides want to keep the language list, with the incoming branch adding Turkish support
- The HEAD side wants dependency injection with `@Inject`
- The incoming side wants to add an additional dependency `ConfigDetectorDialog`

The resolution should combine both intents: keep the `@Inject` annotation, include all languages including Turkish, and add the new parameter.

```java
	private Text notScannedText;
	private Button[] displayMethod;
	private Button showInfoCheckbox;
	private Button askConfirmationCheckbox;
	private Combo languageCombo;
	private String[] languages = { "system", "en", "hu", "lt", "es", "ku", "tr" };

	@Inject public PreferencesDialog(PingerRegistry pingerRegistry, Config globalConfig, ScannerConfig scannerConfig, GUIConfig guiConfig, ConfigDetectorDialog configDetectorDialog) {
		this.pingerRegistry = pingerRegistry;
		this.globalConfig = globalConfig;
		this.scannerConfig = scannerConfig;
		this.guiConfig = guiConfig;
	}

```
