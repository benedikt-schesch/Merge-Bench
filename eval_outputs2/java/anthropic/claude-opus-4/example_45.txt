Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add a getter method for deck IDs, but with different implementations:

- HEAD uses `customDecksIds` returning `Set<Integer>`
- The incoming change uses `cardcastDeckIds` returning `Set<String>`

Based on the semantic intent, it appears that:
1. HEAD renamed the concept from "cardcast" to "custom" decks
2. HEAD also changed the ID type from String to Integer

Since both changes appear to be intentional refactoring (renaming for clarity and changing the data type), I'll preserve the HEAD version as it seems to be the more recent/desired state of the codebase.

```java
  public void updateGameSettings(final GameOptions newOptions) {
    this.options.update(newOptions);
    notifyGameOptionsChanged();
  }

  public Set<Integer> getCustomDeckIds() {
    return customDecksIds;
  }

  /**
   * Get information about this game, without the game's password.
