Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic result - calling `pigContext.getDfs().asElement(fullPath(fileSpec, pigContext))`. The only difference is formatting:

- HEAD version has the method call split across two lines
- The other version has it on a single line

Since both versions are functionally identical and the single-line version is more concise and readable for this relatively short method call, I'll resolve it to use the single-line version:

```java
    
    static public InputStream open(String fileSpec, PigContext pigContext) throws IOException {
        fileSpec = checkDefaultPrefix(pigContext.getExecType(), fileSpec);
        if (!fileSpec.startsWith(LOCAL_PREFIX)) {
            init(pigContext);
            ElementDescriptor elem = pigContext.getDfs().asElement(fullPath(fileSpec, pigContext));
            return openDFSFile(elem);
        }
        else {
            fileSpec = fileSpec.substring(LOCAL_PREFIX.length());
            //buffering because we only want buffered streams to be passed to load functions.

```
