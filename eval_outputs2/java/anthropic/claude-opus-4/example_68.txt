Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add a synchronized set to track deck IDs, but with different approaches:

- HEAD: Uses `Set<Integer> customDecksIds` - tracking custom decks with integer IDs
- The other branch: Uses `Set<String> cardcastDeckIds` - tracking Cardcast decks with string IDs

Since these appear to be tracking different types of decks (custom decks vs Cardcast decks) and use different ID types (Integer vs String), the semantic intent seems to be that both should be kept. They serve different purposes rather than being conflicting implementations of the same feature.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
  private final ConnectedUsers connectedUsers;
  private final GameManager gameManager;
  private final Provider<Session> sessionProvider;
  private final Object blackCardLock = new Object();
  private final GameOptions options;
  private final Set<Integer> customDecksIds = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<Integer>());
  private final Set<String> cardcastDeckIds = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());
  private final Metrics metrics;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showGameLinkProvider;
  private final Provider<String> gamePermalinkFormatProvider;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showRoundLinkProvider;

```
