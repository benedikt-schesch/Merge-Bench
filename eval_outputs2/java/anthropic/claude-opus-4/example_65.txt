Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - returning an empty ArrayList when the game state is not PLAYING. The only difference is the syntax used:

- HEAD uses the explicit generic type declaration: `new ArrayList<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>>()`
- The incoming change uses the diamond operator: `new ArrayList<>()`

Since Java 7, the diamond operator (`<>`) is the preferred way to instantiate generic types as it reduces verbosity while maintaining type safety through type inference. The compiler can infer the type from the method's return type declaration.

Both approaches are functionally identical, but the diamond operator is more concise and follows modern Java best practices.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
  public List<List<Map<WhiteCardData, Object>>> getWhiteCards(final User user) {
    // if we're in judge mode, return all of the cards and ignore which user is asking
    if (state == GameState.JUDGING) {
      return getWhiteCards();
    } else if (state != GameState.PLAYING) {
      return new ArrayList<>();
    } else {
      // getPlayerForUser synchronizes on players. This has caused a deadlock in the past.
      // Good idea to not nest synchronizes if possible anyway.
      final Player player = getPlayerForUser(user);
      synchronized (playedCards) {

```
