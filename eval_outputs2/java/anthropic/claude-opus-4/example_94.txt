Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

1. **HEAD (current branch)**: Creates a new Game with a specific set of parameters
2. **Incoming change**: Creates a new Game with the same parameters PLUS two additional parameters: `falseProvider` and `gameOptionsProvider`

The semantic intent appears to be that the incoming change is adding new parameters to the Game constructor (likely due to a refactoring or new feature that requires these additional dependencies).

Since both sides are trying to create a Game object for testing purposes, and the incoming change has additional parameters that are likely required by an updated Game constructor, I should accept the incoming change with its additional parameters while maintaining the proper formatting.

```java
    // remove game 1 using its own method -- this should be how it always happens in production
    gameManager.destroyGame(1);
    // make sure it re-uses that id
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());
    gameManager.getGames().put(1,
        new Game(1, cuMock, gameManager, timer, null, null, null, metricsMock, falseProvider,
            formatProvider, falseProvider, formatProvider, falseProvider, gameOptionsProvider));
    assertEquals(-1, gameManager.get().intValue());

    // remove game 1 out from under it, to make sure it'll fix itself
    gameManager.getGames().remove(1);
    assertEquals(1, gameManager.get().intValue());

```
