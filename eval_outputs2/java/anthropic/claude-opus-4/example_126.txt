Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

1. **HEAD (current branch)**: Uses `commit.commit.message` to access the commit message
2. **Incoming change**: Uses `commit.message` to access the commit message

This appears to be a structural difference in how the commit message is accessed from the `Commit` object. The HEAD version suggests a nested structure where the commit message is inside a `commit` property of the `Commit` object, while the incoming change suggests a flatter structure where `message` is directly on the `Commit` object.

Given that:
- The condition checks for `commit.commit != null && commit.commit.message != null`
- This suggests the HEAD version's nested structure is the correct one
- The incoming change's direct access to `commit.message` would be inconsistent with the null check

The semantically correct resolution is to use the HEAD version:

```java

  @Override
  public void onResponse(Commit commit, boolean firstTime) {

    if (commit.commit != null && commit.commit.message != null) {
      commitMessageTextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(commit.commit.message));
    }

    User author = commit.author;

    if (author != null) {

```
