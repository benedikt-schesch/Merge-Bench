Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import logging functionality, but they're using different logging frameworks:

- HEAD is using Log4j 2.x (org.apache.logging.log4j)
- The other branch is using Log4j 1.x (org.apache.log4j)

Since HEAD appears to be upgrading to the newer Log4j 2.x framework (which is the recommended approach as Log4j 1.x is deprecated), and the intent of both sides is to have logging functionality available, the semantic resolution would be to keep the HEAD version with Log4j 2.x.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import net.socialgamer.cah.RequestWrapper;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.ConnectedUsers;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.QueuedMessage;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.QueuedMessage.MessageType;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.User;

import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpSession;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;
