Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch) is adding imports for `Component` and `CameraComponent` from the `org.spout.api.component` package
- The incoming change (67bcb76...) is removing these imports (or never had them)

Without more context about the actual usage of these imports in the rest of the file, I cannot determine whether these imports should be kept or removed. The conflict appears to be about whether these component-related imports are needed in this file.

Since I cannot determine the intent with certainty, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
