Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Sets `repoInfo.branch` to `selectedBranch.getName()` - using the branch name
- **Incoming change**: Sets `repoInfo.branch` to `selectedBranch.getCommit().getSha()` - using the commit SHA

The method is called `openCommits()` and it's creating an intent for `BranchCommitsActivity`. Given the context and the activity name, it seems most logical that the activity would expect a branch name rather than a commit SHA, since it's specifically a "Branch" commits activity.

The semantic intent appears to be to open a view of commits for a particular branch, which would require the branch name to properly identify which branch's commits to display.

Therefore, the HEAD version using `selectedBranch.getName()` is the semantically correct choice.

```java
  private void openCommits() {
    if (selectedBranch != null) {
      RepoInfo repoInfo = new RepoInfo();
      repoInfo.owner = repo.getOwner().getLogin();
      repoInfo.name = repo.name;
      repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getName();
      Intent intent = BranchCommitsActivity.createLauncherIntent(this, repoInfo);
      startActivity(intent);
    }
  }
