Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Has the basic imports without any additional networking-related imports
- **Incoming changes** (67bcb76...): Adds three new imports related to Apache Commons IO and Netty networking libraries

Since this appears to be adding new functionality (networking/channel management with Netty and file filtering with Apache Commons), and there's no conflicting logic between the two sides, the semantic intent is to include both sets of imports. The incoming changes are adding new dependencies that are likely needed for new features.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

import org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.DirectoryFileFilter;
import org.jboss.netty.channel.group.ChannelGroup;
import org.jboss.netty.channel.group.ChannelGroupFuture;
import org.jboss.netty.channel.group.DefaultChannelGroup;
import org.spout.api.Engine;
import org.spout.api.Spout;
import org.spout.api.command.CommandManager;
import org.spout.api.command.CommandSource;
import org.spout.api.command.annotated.AnnotatedCommandExecutorFactory;

```
