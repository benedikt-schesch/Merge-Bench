Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different functionality:

- HEAD is trying to add a `blanksLimit` parameter parsing
- The other branch is trying to save the old password before potentially updating it

Both changes appear to be independent and complementary - one deals with blanks limit and the other with password handling. The semantic intent is to support both features, so both lines should be kept.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```java
          if (!cardSetId.isEmpty()) {
            cardSets.add((CardSet) game.getHibernateSession().load(CardSet.class,
                Integer.parseInt(cardSetId)));
          }
        }
        final int blanksLimit = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(AjaxRequest.BLANKS_LIMIT));
        final String oldPassword = game.getPassword();
        String password = request.getParameter(AjaxRequest.PASSWORD);
        if (password == null) {
          password = "";
        }
        // We're not directly assigning this with Boolean.valueOf() because we want to default to
```
