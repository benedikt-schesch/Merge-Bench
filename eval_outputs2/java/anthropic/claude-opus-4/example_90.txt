Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Imports specific Google Guice classes individually (`AbstractModule`, `BindingAnnotation`, `Provides`) and also imports `net.socialgamer.cah.data.GameOptions`
- **Incoming branch**: Uses a wildcard import for Google Guice (`com.google.inject.*`) and imports `net.socialgamer.cah.CahModule`

Both sides want to import Google Guice classes, just with different styles (explicit vs wildcard). Each side also adds a different additional import from the `net.socialgamer.cah` package.

The semantic intent appears to be that both branches need Guice imports and both have added different CAH-related imports that are likely both needed. The resolution should include all the imports that both sides need.
