Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both branches are working in the same area of code but with different intents:

- The HEAD branch has the ContentEditorPresenter initialization followed directly by the toolbar menu setup
- The incoming branch (f8f91f1d) adds code to set the action bar background color between these two operations

Both changes appear to be independent and non-conflicting in terms of functionality. The incoming change is adding UI customization for the action bar, while the existing code flow remains intact. Therefore, both changes should be kept.

Here is the resolved code:

```java

      Scheduler observeOn = AndroidSchedulers.mainThread();
      Scheduler subscribeOn = Schedulers.io();
      contentEditorPresenter = new ContentEditorPresenter(getString(R.string.imgur_client_id), new ImgurUpload(), observeOn, subscribeOn);

      if (getSupportActionBar() != null) {
        getSupportActionBar().setBackgroundDrawable(new ColorDrawable(AttributesUtils.getPrimaryColor(this)));
      }

      toolbarExtra.inflateMenu(R.menu.content_editor_extra);
      toolbarExtra.setOnMenuItemClickListener(this);

      final String hint = getIntent().getExtras().getString(HINT);


```
