Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

1. **HEAD (left side)**: Declares `funcSpec` as a `String`
2. **Right side**: Declares `funcSpec` as a `FuncSpec` object

Looking at the usage context:
- `funcSpec` is retrieved from `definedFunctions.get(alias)`
- It's then passed to `instantiateFuncFromSpec(funcSpec)`
- There's also a fallback case that calls `instantiateFuncFromSpec(alias)` where `alias` appears to be a String

The conflict seems to be about whether `definedFunctions` stores String values or FuncSpec objects. Given that:
1. The method `instantiateFuncFromSpec` is called with both `funcSpec` and `alias` (a String) in different branches
2. The method name suggests it takes a specification to instantiate from

It appears the HEAD version (using String) is more consistent with the fallback behavior where `alias` (a String) is passed to the same method. The right side's attempt to use `FuncSpec` type would likely require different handling or method signatures.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
        }
        return resolveClassName(className);
    }
  
    public Object instantiateFuncFromAlias(String alias) throws IOException {
        String funcSpec;
        if (definedFunctions != null && (funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias))!=null)
            return instantiateFuncFromSpec(funcSpec);
        else
            return instantiateFuncFromSpec(alias);
    }

```
