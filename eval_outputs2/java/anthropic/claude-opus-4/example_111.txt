Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add imports, but they're adding different ones:

- HEAD side: (no additional imports beyond the common ones)
- The other side (06e8633...): adds two imports from `org.fest.assertions.internal` package

Since both sides appear to be valid and the imports from the other side don't conflict with anything in HEAD, the semantic intent seems to be to include all the imports. The resolution should keep all imports from both sides.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.spy;

import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Rule;

import org.fest.assertions.internal.Failures;
import org.fest.assertions.internal.Shorts;
import org.fest.test.ExpectedException;
import org.fest.assertions.util.AbsValueComparator;
import org.fest.util.ComparatorBasedComparisonStrategy;
