Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - checking if the white deck has enough cards and returning the result. The key difference is:

- HEAD version: Uses an explicit if statement to return false, then returns true
- The other version: Uses a single return statement with the comparison

Both achieve the exact same logic, but the second version is more concise. Since both have the same intent and the more concise version is functionally identical, I'll resolve by choosing the cleaner implementation:

```java
      if (tempBlackDeck.totalCount() < MINIMUM_BLACK_CARDS) {
        return false;
      }

      final WhiteDeck tempWhiteDeck = loadWhiteDeck(cardSets);
      return tempWhiteDeck.totalCount() >= getRequiredWhiteCardCount();
    }
  }

  /**
   * Deal cards for this round. The game immediately then moves into the {@code Playing} state.

```
