Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the conflict is about whether to include a `getPigContext()` method or not. 

The HEAD branch (current branch) does not have this method, while the incoming branch (f6a8f7aa42cae344f71cc6759f1c7880b49211fc) adds a `@Private` annotated `getPigContext()` method that returns `pigContext`.

Without more context about the overall class structure and the intent of both branches, I cannot determine whether this method should be included or excluded. The semantic intent is ambiguous - one branch intentionally doesn't have this getter while the other branch intentionally adds it.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
                break;
            }
        }
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    @Private
    public PigContext getPigContext() {
        return pigContext;
    }

>>>>>>> f6a8f7aa42cae344f71cc6759f1c7880b49211fc
    public void start() {
        startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        userId = System.getProperty("user.name");
    }
