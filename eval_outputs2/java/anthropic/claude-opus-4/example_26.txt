Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has three import statements that were removed in the other branch (5463b8f87d835f29ccb1c4feedad7ffad49380f6).

The conflict appears to be about whether to keep these imports:
- `org.spout.api.util.StringMap`
- `org.spout.api.util.StringUtil`
- `org.spout.cereal.config.ConfigurationException`

Without seeing how these imports are used in the rest of the file, I cannot determine whether they should be kept or removed. The intent is ambiguous - the HEAD branch may have added code that requires these imports, or the other branch may have cleaned up unused imports.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
import org.spout.api.plugin.security.PluginSecurityManager;
import org.spout.api.plugin.services.ServiceManager;
import org.spout.api.protocol.Protocol;
import org.spout.api.scheduler.TaskManager;
import org.spout.api.scheduler.TaskPriority;
