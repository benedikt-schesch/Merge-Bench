Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they're both implementing the `isNotEqualTo` method. The only difference is formatting: one side has a space before the opening brace `{` and the other doesn't.

Since modern Java style guides (including Google's and most common conventions) recommend having a space before the opening brace in method declarations, I'll resolve this by keeping the version with the space.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
>>>>>>> 61056d641fa4f45156766a8c333ee3f4179fcae7
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }

  public ShortAssert isNotEqualTo(short expected) {
    shorts.assertNotEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }


```
