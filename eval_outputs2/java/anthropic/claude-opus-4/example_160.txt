Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

1. **HEAD side**: Uses a non-static instance field for the logger with `getClass()` - this allows each instance to have its own logger named after the actual runtime class.

2. **Incoming side**: Uses a static final logger with explicit class reference `Combine.class`, and adds a comment about HADOOP-3226 regarding combiners being called multiple times, plus a static boolean flag `firstTime`.

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want logging capability
- The incoming side is addressing a specific Hadoop issue (HADOOP-3226) about combiners being called multiple times
- The incoming side needs to track first-time execution with a static flag

For proper resolution, we should:
- Use the static logger approach (as it's more memory efficient for Hadoop jobs and the incoming side has specific Hadoop-related requirements)
- Keep the HADOOP-3226 comment and `firstTime` flag as they address a specific issue

Here's the resolved code:

```java
    public static JobContext sJobContext = null;

    public static class Combine
            extends Reducer<PigNullableWritable, NullableTuple, PigNullableWritable, Writable> {

        private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Combine.class);

        //HADOOP-3226 Combiners can be called multiple times in both map and reduce
        private static boolean firstTime = true;

        private byte keyType;

        //The reduce plan
        private PhysicalPlan cp;

```
