Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same method signature for an interface, with the only difference being the presence of the `public` modifier.

In Java interfaces, all methods are implicitly `public` and `abstract`, so including the `public` modifier is redundant but not incorrect. The conflict appears to be a style preference where:
- HEAD includes the explicit `public` modifier
- The incoming change (5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a) follows the more modern convention of omitting redundant modifiers

Since both versions are functionally identical and this appears to be a code style standardization effort, I'll resolve this by choosing the cleaner, more modern style without the redundant `public` modifier:

```java
   */
  public interface DoubleLocalizable {
    /**
     * @return The first user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     */
    String getString();

    /**
     * @return The second user-visible string that is associated with this enum value.
     */

```
