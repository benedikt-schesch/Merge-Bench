Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - creating a perspective projection matrix. The differences are:

1. **TODO comment**: HEAD has "TODO Get FOV" while the other branch has "TODO: Get FOV" (with a colon)
2. **Variable assignment**: HEAD uses `projection = ` while the other branch uses `this.projection = `
3. **Method name**: HEAD uses `Matrix4.createPerspective` while the other branch uses `MatrixMath.createPerspective`

The most significant semantic difference is the method name change from `Matrix4` to `MatrixMath`, which appears to be a refactoring. The other differences are stylistic.

Resolving in favor of the more explicit style and the refactored class name:

```java
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public void onAttached() {
		// TODO: Get FOV
		this.projection = MatrixMath.createPerspective(fieldOfView, 4.0f / 3.0f, .001f, 1000f);
		updateView();
	}

	@Override
	public Matrix4 getProjection() {

```
