Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to provide the same dependency but with different naming:

- HEAD: Uses `ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase` (both as return type and class name)
- Other branch: Uses `ChangeRepositoryStarRepository` (both as return type and class name)

This appears to be a naming refactor where one branch renamed the class from `Repository` to `UseCase` pattern. Since both sides are semantically trying to achieve the same thing (providing a dependency for changing repository star status), and the conflict is purely about naming, I cannot determine which naming convention is preferred without more context about the codebase's architecture decisions.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
    return new GenericRepository<>(null, api);
  }

  @Provides
  @PerActivity
<<<<<<< HEAD
  ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase provideChangeRepositoryStarRepository() {
    return new ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase();
=======
  ChangeRepositoryStarRepository provideChangeRepositoryStarRepository() {
    return new ChangeRepositoryStarRepository();
>>>>>>> 46751d2846d926dab116569835f3660a6297da86
  }

  @Provides
  @PerActivity
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
