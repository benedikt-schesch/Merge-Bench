Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Has a trailing newline/whitespace after the return statement
- The incoming change (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309): Has no trailing whitespace after the return statement

This appears to be a simple whitespace/formatting conflict. The semantic intent of both sides is identical - they both want to return the result of `openDFSFile()`. The only difference is the presence or absence of trailing whitespace.

In terms of best practices, having trailing whitespace is generally discouraged in most coding standards. Therefore, I'll resolve this by choosing the version without the trailing whitespace.

```java
        if (wrapper == null)
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "can't open DFS file while executing locally");
        
        return openDFSFile(fileName, ConfigurationUtil.toProperties(wrapper.getJobConf()));

    }

    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName, Properties properties) throws IOException{
        DataStorage dds = new HDataStorage(properties);
        ElementDescriptor elem = dds.asElement(fileName);

```
