Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic change - they both want the same method signature for `isEqualTo(short expected)`. The only difference is the spacing before the opening curly brace:

- HEAD version: `isEqualTo(short expected){` (no space before `{`)
- The other version: `isEqualTo(short expected) {` (with space before `{`)

Since this is purely a formatting difference with no semantic difference, I'll resolve this by choosing the version with the space before the curly brace, as this is the more common Java coding convention.

```java

  protected ShortAssert(Short actual, Description description) {
    super(actual, ShortAssert.class, description);
  }

  public ShortAssert isEqualTo(short expected) {
    shorts.assertEqualTo(description, actual, expected);
    return this;
  }
