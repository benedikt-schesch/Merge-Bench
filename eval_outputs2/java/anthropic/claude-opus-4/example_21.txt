Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Wants to start the `WorldSavingThread`
- **Incoming change**: Wants to notify filesystem installations with `filesystem.notifyInstalls()`

Both changes appear to be initialization/startup tasks that happen after the filesystem's `postStartup()` method and before the "Done Loading" message. These don't seem to be mutually exclusive - both operations could be necessary for proper system initialization.

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Complete filesystem post-startup tasks
2. Initialize world saving functionality (HEAD)
3. Notify about filesystem installations (incoming)
4. Signal that the system is ready

Here's the resolved conflict that includes both operations:

```java
			}
		}
		getEventManager().registerEvents(listener, this);
		getEventManager().callEvent(new EngineStartEvent());
		filesystem.postStartup();
		WorldSavingThread.startThread();
		filesystem.notifyInstalls();
		Spout.info("Done Loading, ready for players.");
	}

	@Override
	protected void setupBindings(SpoutConfiguration config) {

```
