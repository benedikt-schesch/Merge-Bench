Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the case where a glob pattern matches files. The conflict appears to be about the flow control after checking if the glob matches files.

From the HEAD side:
- After checking that the glob matches files, it continues to the return statement below

From the incoming change (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309):
- It adds an else block that gets file element descriptors and returns immediately

The semantic intent seems to be the same - both sides want to return a `DataStorageInputStreamIterator` with the elements. The incoming change makes this more explicit by getting the elements and returning within the else block, while HEAD relies on falling through to the return statement below.

The incoming change appears to be more explicit and clearer in its intent. Here's the resolved conflict:

```java
        } else {
            // It might be a glob
            if (!globMatchesFiles(elem, elem.getDataStorage())) {
                throw new IOException(elem.toString() + " does not exist");
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
                
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
