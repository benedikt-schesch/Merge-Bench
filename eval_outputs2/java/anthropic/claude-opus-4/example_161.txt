Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same intent - they both want to include the Apache license header. The conflict appears to be about whether to have a blank line between the two license header sections.

The HEAD version includes a blank line after the first license block, while the other branch (1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309) does not have this blank line.

Since both sides have the same semantic intent (including the Apache license headers), and the only difference is formatting, I'll resolve this by keeping the version without the blank line for consistency:
