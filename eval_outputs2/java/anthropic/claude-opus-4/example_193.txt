Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

**HEAD (left side):**
- Converts `args` to a String array using `args.toArray(new String[0])`
- Stores it in `argArr`
- Wraps this array in `wrappedArgs[0]`

**Incoming change (right side):**
- Directly assigns `args` to `wrappedArgs[0]` without conversion

The context shows this is handling a varargs constructor that expects `String[].class`. The HEAD version is correct because:
1. The constructor expects `String[]` (as shown by `getConstructor(String[].class)`)
2. `args` appears to be a collection that needs to be converted to an array
3. The varargs constructor needs the array wrapped in another Object array for `newInstance()`

The incoming change would likely fail because it's passing the collection directly instead of converting it to the required String array.

Here's the resolved code:

```java
        }
        catch(NoSuchMethodException nme) {
            // Second channce. Try with var arg constructor
            try {
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(String[].class);
                String[] argArr = args.toArray(new String[0]) ;
                Object[] wrappedArgs = new Object[1] ;
                wrappedArgs[0] = argArr ;
                ret =  c.newInstance(wrappedArgs);
            }
            catch(Throwable e){
                // bad luck
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

```
