Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different import statements to the file. The HEAD branch is adding a Google Guava import for `ImmutableList`, while the other branch is adding Google Guice imports and a `GameOptions` import.

Since both sets of imports serve different purposes and don't conflict with each other semantically, the resolution should include both sets of imports. Here's the resolved version:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

import javax.servlet.ServletContext;

import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;
import com.google.inject.*;
import net.socialgamer.cah.data.GameOptions;
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.hibernate.Session;

import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableSet;
import com.google.inject.assistedinject.FactoryModuleBuilder;

```
