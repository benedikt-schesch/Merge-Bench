Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the semantic differences between the two versions:

**HEAD version:**
- Uses `new Player[players.size()]` - creates an array with exact size needed
- Uses `new ArrayList<String>(playersCopy.length)` - old diamond operator syntax

**Incoming version:**
- Uses `new Player[0]` - creates zero-length array (modern Java idiom)
- Uses `new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length)` - modern diamond operator syntax

Both versions achieve the same semantic goal: converting a collection of players to an array and then creating a list of player names. The incoming version uses more modern Java idioms:
- `toArray(new Player[0])` is the preferred modern approach as it's actually faster than pre-sized arrays in modern JVMs
- The diamond operator `<>` is cleaner than repeating the type

Since both achieve the same intent and the incoming version uses more modern Java practices, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming changes:

```java
    info.put(GameInfo.HOST, host.getUser().getNickname());
    info.put(GameInfo.STATE, state.toString());
    info.put(GameInfo.GAME_OPTIONS, options.serialize(includePassword));
    info.put(GameInfo.HAS_PASSWORD, options.password != null && !options.password.equals(""));

    final Player[] playersCopy = players.toArray(new Player[0]);
    final List<String> playerNames = new ArrayList<>(playersCopy.length);
    for (final Player player : playersCopy) {
      playerNames.add(player.getUser().getNickname());
    }
    info.put(GameInfo.PLAYERS, playerNames);
