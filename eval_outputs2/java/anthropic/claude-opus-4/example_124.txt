Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import classes related to changing repository star and watch functionality, but they're using different naming conventions:

- HEAD is using `UseCase` suffix (following the Use Case pattern)
- The other branch is using `Repository` suffix (following the Repository pattern)

Without more context about the project's architecture and which pattern is being followed throughout the codebase, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The intent is ambiguous - both sides want to import classes for star/watch functionality, but they represent different architectural approaches.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
import core.datasource.RestWrapper;
import core.datasource.SdkItem;
import core.repositories.Branch;
import core.repositories.Commit;
import core.repositories.Repo;
<<<<<<< HEAD
