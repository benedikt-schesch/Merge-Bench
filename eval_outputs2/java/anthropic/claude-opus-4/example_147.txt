Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to set the same property to enable the accumulator optimization, but they're using different approaches:

- HEAD is using `PigConfiguration.OPT_ACCUMULATOR` - a constant that likely holds the string value
- The other branch is using the string literal `"opt.accumulator"` directly

Since both are setting the same property to "true", and using a constant is generally better practice than a string literal (it's more maintainable and less error-prone), I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```java
        pigServer.registerQuery("B = group A by id;");
        pigServer.registerQuery("C = foreach B generate group," +
                "org.apache.pig.test.utils.AccumulativeSumBag(A);");

        checkAccumulatorOff("C");
        pigServer.getPigContext().getProperties().setProperty(
                PigConfiguration.OPT_ACCUMULATOR, "true");
    }

    private void checkAccumulatorOff(String alias) {
        try {
            Iterator<Tuple> iter = pigServer.openIterator(alias);

```
