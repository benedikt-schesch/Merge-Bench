Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they both want a blank line after the `PigStats stats = PigRunner.run(args, null);` statement. The HEAD version has one blank line, and the other branch (57eb1bac81a4e03e9838c06f642a1432dbbe4e1b) has a blank line with trailing spaces.

Since both sides want the same semantic result (a blank line for readability), I'll resolve this by keeping a single blank line without trailing spaces, which is the cleaner approach from the HEAD version.

```java
        fw1.close();

        try {
           String[] args = { "-x", "local", "-c", PIG_FILE };
           PigStats stats = PigRunner.run(args, null);

           assertTrue(stats.isSuccessful());
           assertEquals( 0, stats.getReturnCode() );
        } finally {
            new File(PIG_FILE).delete();
            Util.deleteFile(cluster, OUTPUT_FILE);

```
