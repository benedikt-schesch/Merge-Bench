Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they both want to include the same fields and comment. The only difference is the ordering:

- HEAD has the comment after `roundPermalinkFormatProvider`
- The incoming branch has the comment before `roundPermalinkFormatProvider`

Since both versions contain exactly the same content and the positioning of a comment doesn't affect functionality, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD's ordering (comment after the field declaration) as it groups the comment more naturally with the field that follows it.

```java
  private final Metrics metrics;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showGameLinkProvider;
  private final Provider<String> gamePermalinkFormatProvider;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showRoundLinkProvider;
  private final Provider<String> roundPermalinkFormatProvider;

  // All of these delays could be moved to pyx.properties.
  private final Provider<Boolean> allowBlankCardsProvider;
  private final long created = System.currentTimeMillis();
  /**
   * Lock object to prevent judging during idle judge detection and vice-versa.
   */
```
