Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add a service provider initialization in the constructor, but they're using different names for what appears to be the same or related service:

- HEAD wants: `this.customDecksServiceProvider = customDecksServiceProvider;`
- The incoming change wants: `this.cardcastServiceProvider = cardcastServiceProvider;`

Based on the naming pattern and context, these appear to be related to card deck services. The conflict seems to be a naming change where "cardcastServiceProvider" was renamed to "customDecksServiceProvider" (or vice versa).

Without more context about which name is the intended final name, I cannot determine which one should be kept. The semantic intent appears to be the same (initializing a deck service provider), but the specific implementation name differs.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```java
    this.options = gameOptionsProvider.get();
    this.connectedUsers = connectedUsers;
    this.gameManager = gameManager;
    this.globalTimer = globalTimer;
    this.sessionProvider = sessionProvider;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    this.customDecksServiceProvider = customDecksServiceProvider;
=======
    this.cardcastServiceProvider = cardcastServiceProvider;
>>>>>>> 5adedd24812861bedaf540555ec046744b42b42a
    this.uniqueIdProvider = uniqueIdProvider;
    this.metrics = metrics;
    this.showRoundLinkProvider = showRoundLinkProvider;
    this.roundPermalinkFormatProvider = roundPermalinkFormatProvider;
    this.showGameLinkProvider = showGameLinkProvider;
```
