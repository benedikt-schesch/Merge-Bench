Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import a Vector3 class, but from different packages:
- HEAD: `import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;`
- The other branch: `import org.spout.api.math.Vector3;`

Based on the context and the fact that there's already an import from `org.spout.api.math` (ReactConverter), it appears the codebase is transitioning from one package structure to another. The HEAD version seems to be using a more specific/newer package structure (`org.spout.math.vector`), while the other branch is using what appears to be an older structure (`org.spout.api.math`).

Since the HEAD version represents the more recent/current state and uses a more specific package path that aligns with modern Java package organization patterns, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```java
 * the MIT license.
 */
package org.spout.api.collision;

import org.spout.api.math.ReactConverter;
import org.spout.math.vector.Vector3;
import org.spout.physics.collision.ContactInfo;

public class SpoutContactInfo {
	private final ContactInfo wrapped;


```
