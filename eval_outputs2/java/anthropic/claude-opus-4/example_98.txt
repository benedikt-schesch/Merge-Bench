<think>
No reasoning found</think>
Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch): Includes a comment "// shouldn't ever happen, but just in case..." before the null check
- The other branch: Removes this comment entirely

The semantic intent appears to be:
- The comment suggests that `player` being null is an unexpected edge case
- The code still handles the null case with a defensive check
- The other branch seems to have removed the comment, possibly because:
  - It was deemed unnecessary
  - The null check is self-documenting
  - Or they found that null can legitimately happen

Since both sides keep the actual null check logic intact and only differ on whether to include the explanatory comment, and since the comment provides useful context about the developer's expectations, I'll keep it. This preserves the defensive programming approach while maintaining the documentation of intent.

```java
        return ErrorCode.NOT_JUDGE;
      } else if (state != GameState.JUDGING) {
        return ErrorCode.NOT_YOUR_TURN;
      }

      // shouldn't ever happen, but just in case...
      if (null != player) {
        player.resetSkipCount();
      }

      cardPlayer = playedCards.getPlayerForId(cardId);

```
