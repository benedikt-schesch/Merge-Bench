As a semantic merge conflict resolution expert, my goal is to understand the intent behind the changes on both sides and combine them logically.

*   **`HEAD` Branch Intent:** This branch introduces a new public method `run()`. The purpose of this method is to configure the `parser` for interactive use (`setInteractive(true)`) and to enable continuous parsing even if an error occurs (`parseContOnError()`). This appears to be adding a new feature or entry point for running the parser.

*   **`1488b22...` Branch Intent:** This branch has no changes within the conflict block. It essentially represents the state of the code before the `run()` method was added.

**Resolution:**

The conflict is between adding a new self-contained method and not having that method. A semantic merge should combine functionalities from both branches. Since `HEAD` adds a new, non-conflicting feature (the `run()` method), the correct resolution is to include this addition. This combines the features of both branches, resulting in a version of the code that includes the new `run()` method.

I will resolve the conflict by accepting the changes from the `HEAD` branch.

```java
        if (in != null)
        {
            parser = new GruntParser(in);
            parser.setParams(pig);    
        }
    }

    public void run() {
    parser.setInteractive(true);
    parser.parseContOnError();
    }

    public void setConsoleReader(ConsoleReader c)
    {
        parser.setConsoleReader(c);

```
