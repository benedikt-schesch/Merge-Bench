The semantic intent of both sides of this merge is to add new settings to the `updateGameSettings` method. The `HEAD` branch adds a setting for `newMaxBlanks`, while the other branch adds `newMaxSpectators`. The method body includes the line `this.maxSpectators = newMaxSpectators;`, confirming the intent of that parameter. To preserve the functionality from both branches, the correct resolution is to combine the parameters from both sides into the method signature.

```java
  public String getPassword() {
    return password;
  }

  public void updateGameSettings(final int newScoreGoal, final int newMaxPlayers,
      final int newMaxSpectators, final int newMaxBlanks, final Set<CardSet> newCardSets,
      final String newPassword, final boolean newUseTimer) {
    this.scoreGoal = newScoreGoal;
    this.maxPlayers = newMaxPlayers;
    this.maxSpectators = newMaxSpectators;
    synchronized (this.cardSets) {
      this.cardSets.clear();

```
