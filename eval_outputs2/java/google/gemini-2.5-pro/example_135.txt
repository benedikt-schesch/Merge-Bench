The semantic intent of both sides of this merge conflict is to add a blank line for readability, separating the setup of the `PigRunner` from the assertions on the results.

The `HEAD` version adds a clean blank line, while the other version adds a blank line with extraneous leading whitespace. The cleaner, more conventional, and stylistically correct approach is to have a simple empty line. Therefore, the `HEAD` version is the correct resolution.

```java
        fw1.close();

        try {
           String[] args = { "-x", "local", "-c", PIG_FILE };
           PigStats stats = PigRunner.run(args, null);

           assertTrue(stats.isSuccessful());
           assertEquals( 0, stats.getReturnCode() );
        } finally {
            new File(PIG_FILE).delete();
            Util.deleteFile(cluster, OUTPUT_FILE);

```
