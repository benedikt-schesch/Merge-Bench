This merge conflict arises from a change in the type of the `args` variable.

*   The `HEAD` branch treats `args` as a `Collection` (e.g., `List`), using `args.size()` to get its size.
*   The other branch treats `args` as an array, using `args.length`.

Using a `Collection` like `List` is often a more modern and flexible approach in Java than using a raw array. The change to `args.size()` was likely part of a deliberate refactoring to use a `Collection`. Therefore, the resolution will adopt the `HEAD` version, assuming `args` is now a `Collection`.

```java
            throw new RuntimeException("Cannot instantiate:" + className, ioe) ;
        }

        try {
            // Do normal instantiation
            if (args != null && args.size() > 0) {
                Class paramTypes[] = new Class[args.size()];
                for (int i = 0; i < paramTypes.length; i++) {
                    paramTypes[i] = String.class;
                }
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(paramTypes);
