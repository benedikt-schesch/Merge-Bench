Resolving this merge conflict requires understanding the semantics of Java reflection, specifically the `Constructor.newInstance(Object... initargs)` method, and how different types are handled when passed to it.

### Analysis of Intent

*   **`HEAD` Branch (`ret = c.newInstance(args.toArray());`)**: This code implies that the `args` variable is a `java.util.Collection` (e.g., `List`, `Set`). The `.toArray()` method is the standard, type-safe way to convert a collection into an `Object[]` array. This resulting array is then correctly passed to the `newInstance` method, which accepts a variable number of `Object` arguments (`Object...`), effectively an `Object[]`. This approach is robust and follows common Java idioms.

*   **`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` Branch (`ret = c.newInstance((Object[])args);`)**: This code attempts to cast the `args` variable to an `Object[]`. This is a very brittle approach:
    *   If `args` is a `Collection`, this cast will fail at runtime with a `ClassCastException`.
    *   If `args` is an array of a specific type other than `Object` (e.g., `String[]`), this cast will also fail with a `ClassCastException` because a `String[]` is not a subtype of `Object[]`.
    *   This cast only succeeds if `args` is already an `Object[]`, in which case the cast is redundant.

### Resolution

Both branches aim to instantiate an object using a constructor that takes multiple string arguments. The `HEAD` version is functionally superior and safer. It correctly handles the likely scenario where `args` is a collection of arguments by converting it to the `Object[]` array required by `newInstance`. The other version is fragile and likely to cause runtime exceptions under most conditions.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the `HEAD` branch's implementation.

```java
                for (int i = 0; i < paramTypes.length; i++) {
                    paramTypes[i] = String.class;
                }
                Constructor c = objClass.getConstructor(paramTypes);
                ret =  c.newInstance(args.toArray());
            } else {
                ret = objClass.newInstance();
            }
        }
        catch(NoSuchMethodException nme) {
