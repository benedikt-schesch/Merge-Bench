An analysis of the conflicting changes reveals two primary intents:
1.  **HEAD**: This change introduces a dependency on `net.socialgamer.cah.data.GameOptions`.
2.  **`ed08e371...`**: This change refactors the Guice imports to use a wildcard (`com.google.inject.*`) and adds a new dependency on `net.socialgamer.cah.CahModule`.

To resolve this conflict semantically, we should combine these intents. The new code will use the wildcard import for Guice as intended by one branch, and include the specific class imports from both branches. This ensures all dependencies are met while respecting the refactoring choice.
