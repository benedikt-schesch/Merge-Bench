An analysis of the conflict reveals two different states of the code.

*   **The `HEAD` branch** introduces two new member variables: `jobOutputFile` and `jobConf`. The comments suggest these are for tracking the output of a Pig script and the configuration of the currently running MapReduce job, respectively.
*   **The incoming branch (`1488b22...`)** does not have these variables.

**Intent:** The intent of the `HEAD` branch is to add new state-tracking capabilities to the class, likely for managing job execution details. The incoming branch represents a version of the code before these features were added.

**Resolution:** The most logical resolution is to combine the changes by keeping the new fields from the `HEAD` branch. Removing them would discard the new functionality. Therefore, the additions are preserved.

```java
    // handle to the back-end
    transient private ExecutionEngine executionEngine;
   
    private String jobName = JOB_NAME_PREFIX;    // can be overwritten by users
  
    // Pig Script Output
    private String jobOutputFile = "";
    
    // JobConf of the currently executing Map-Reduce job
    JobConf jobConf;
    
    private Properties properties;
    
    /**
     * a table mapping function names to function specs.
     */
