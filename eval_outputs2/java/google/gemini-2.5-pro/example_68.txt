This merge conflict involves two separate changes: the introduction of a field to track custom card decks, and the addition of a blank line for formatting.

1.  **Custom Decks Field**: `HEAD` introduces `customDecksIds` as a `Set<Integer>`, while the other branch introduces `cardcastDeckIds` as a `Set<String>`. "Cardcast" was a specific, popular service for creating custom decks for this type of game, and it used short alphanumeric strings as deck identifiers. The change from a generic `customDecksIds` with `Integer` IDs to a specific `cardcastDeckIds` with `String` IDs represents a likely evolution of the feature, making it more specific and functional. Therefore, we'll keep the `cardcastDeckIds` version as it reflects the more mature and specific intent.

2.  **Blank Line**: `HEAD` adds a blank line after the list of fields. This is a common stylistic choice to improve readability by separating class fields from methods or constructors. We will keep this blank line.

By combining these resolutions, we can integrate the semantic intents of both branches.

  private final ConnectedUsers connectedUsers;
  private final GameManager gameManager;

  private final Set<String> cardcastDeckIds = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());
  private final Metrics metrics;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showGameLinkProvider;
  private final Provider<String> gamePermalinkFormatProvider;
  private final Provider<Boolean> showRoundLinkProvider;
