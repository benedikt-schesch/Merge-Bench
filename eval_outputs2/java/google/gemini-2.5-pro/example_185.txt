This merge conflict involves a stylistic choice regarding whitespace between a class or method's closing curly brace and the next method definition.

*   **HEAD** introduces an extra line containing only whitespace. This is likely an unintentional formatting artifact and is often flagged by code style linters.
*   **Branch `1488b22...`** has no extra line, resulting in a cleaner, more compact style.

The most sensible resolution is to remove the extraneous whitespace. This aligns with common code cleanup practices and improves readability by removing a line that serves no functional or conventional stylistic purpose. The intent of the `1488b22...` side appears to be a simple code cleanup.

```java
                                paramFiles.size() > 0 ? paramFiles.toArray(type2) : null);
        return new BufferedReader(new StringReader(writer.toString()));
    }
}
    
private static String getVersionString() {
	String findContainingJar = JarManager.findContainingJar(Main.class);
	  try { 
		  StringBuffer buffer = new  StringBuffer();
          JarFile jar = new JarFile(findContainingJar);
