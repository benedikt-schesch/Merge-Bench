An analysis of the conflict reveals that both branches are modifying the whitespace at the end of a method, just before the closing brace.

*   `HEAD` adds a single blank line.
*   The other branch (`1488b22...`) adds two blank lines.

The semantic intent of both changes is purely stylistic: to add vertical spacing for readability. Adding a blank line before a method's closing brace is an unusual style, but the common intent is clear.

A reasonable resolution is to respect the shared intent of adding whitespace while choosing the more common and less excessive option. Therefore, we will keep a single blank line, which is the change from `HEAD`.

```java
        if (wrapper == null)
            throw new RuntimeException(
                    "can't open DFS file while executing locally");
        
        return openDFSFile(fileName, ConfigurationUtil.toProperties(wrapper.getJobConf()));
        
    }

    public static InputStream openDFSFile(String fileName, Properties properties) throws IOException{
        DataStorage dds = new HDataStorage(properties);
        ElementDescriptor elem = dds.asElement(fileName);
