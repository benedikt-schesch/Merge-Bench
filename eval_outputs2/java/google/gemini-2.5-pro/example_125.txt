An expert would recognize that the `HEAD` branch is performing a refactoring from a `Repository` pattern to a `UseCase` pattern (a common architectural improvement). However, the developer forgot to rename the provider method to match the new type it's providing. The other branch represents the older state.

The correct semantic resolution is to complete the refactoring initiated in the `HEAD` branch. This involves using the `ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase` and renaming the method for consistency.

```java
    return new GenericRepository<>(null, api);
  }

  @Provides
  @PerActivity
  ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase provideChangeRepositoryStarUseCase() {
    return new ChangeRepositoryStarUseCase();
  }

  @Provides
  @PerActivity
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
