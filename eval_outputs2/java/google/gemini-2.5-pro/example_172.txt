The conflict arises from one side (`HEAD`) having incomplete logic for handling glob patterns, while the other side (`1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309`) adds the missing logic.

*   **`HEAD`'s Intent:** It checks if a glob pattern matches files. If not, it throws an exception. However, it fails to do anything if the glob *does* match, leading to a bug where the `elements` collection is not populated for this case.
*   **`1488b22...`'s Intent:** It fixes the bug in `HEAD`. It adds an `else` block to handle the case where the glob pattern successfully matches files. In this block, it populates the `elements` collection by calling `getFileElementDescriptors(elem)` and then immediately returns an iterator, correctly completing the logic for this path.

The correct semantic resolution is to incorporate the fix from the `1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309` branch. This involves adding the `else` block that handles a successful glob match. The early `return` within this new block is a valid way to handle this specific code path, leaving the final `return` statement for other paths handled outside the provided snippet (such as an existing file or directory).

```java
>>>>>>> 1488b22ce313803d012c8ace36c3b12f930ee309
        } else {
            // It might be a glob
            if (!globMatchesFiles(elem, elem.getDataStorage())) {
                throw new IOException(elem.toString() + " does not exist");
            } else {
                elements = getFileElementDescriptors(elem); 
                return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
            }
        }
        
        return new DataStorageInputStreamIterator(elements);
