Resolving the conflict requires understanding what the `BranchCommitsActivity` expects for the `branch` field in its `RepoInfo` object.

*   **HEAD:** `repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getName();`
    *   **Intent:** This side intends to pass the *name* of the branch (e.g., "main", "develop") to the next activity. This is the most common and semantically correct approach, as the variable is named `branch`.

*   **Incoming Change:** `repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getCommit().getSha();`
    *   **Intent:** This side intends to pass the *SHA hash* of the latest commit on the branch. While a commit SHA can be used to retrieve commit history, it's not a branch name. Using a SHA "detaches" the view from the branch itself, showing history up to that point rather than the history of the moving branch pointer.

Given that the field is named `repoInfo.branch` and the activity is `BranchCommitsActivity`, the most logical and clear intent is to work with the branch's name. The `HEAD` version is semantically correct and less ambiguous.

```java
  private void openCommits() {
    if (selectedBranch != null) {
      RepoInfo repoInfo = new RepoInfo();
      repoInfo.owner = repo.getOwner().getLogin();
      repoInfo.name = repo.name;
      repoInfo.branch = selectedBranch.getName();
      Intent intent = BranchCommitsActivity.createLauncherIntent(this, repoInfo);
      startActivity(intent);
    }
  }
