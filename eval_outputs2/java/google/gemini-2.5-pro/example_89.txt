The semantic intent of both branches is to add a new, independent `BindingAnnotation`. The `HEAD` branch adds an annotation for a `ServerDiscoveryPort`, likely used to bind a port number for dependency injection. The other branch adds an annotation for `AllowBlankCards`, likely a boolean configuration flag. Since these additions are completely independent and do not conflict logically, the correct resolution is to include both.

```java
  public @interface BannedNicks {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface ServerDiscoveryPort {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  public @interface AllowBlankCards {
  }

  @BindingAnnotation
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<<<<<<< HEAD
