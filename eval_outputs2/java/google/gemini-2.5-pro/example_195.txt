An analysis of the conflict reveals two distinct changes being merged into the `getClassForAlias` method.

1.  **Variable Declarations**:
    *   The `HEAD` version (`String className, funcSpec = null;`) declares `funcSpec` as a `String`.
    *   The incoming change `1488b22...` (`String className = null; FuncSpec funcSpec = null;`) declares `funcSpec` as type `FuncSpec`.
    *   **Intent**: The subsequent code, `funcSpec = definedFunctions.get(alias);`, indicates that `funcSpec` is intended to hold an object of type `FuncSpec` retrieved from the `definedFunctions` map. Declaring it as a `String` would likely cause a compilation error. Therefore, the incoming change is semantically correct as it properly types the variable according to its usage.

2.  **Incomplete Second Conflict**:
    *   A second conflict marker `<<<<<<< HEAD` appears after the `if (funcSpec != null)` block, but it is incomplete without a `=======` or `>>>>>>>` section. This appears to be a copy-paste artifact or a malformed conflict from the git tool.

**Resolution**:

The resolution will adopt the variable declarations from the incoming change (`1488b22...`) as it represents the correct semantic intent. The malformed second conflict marker will be removed as it's incomplete and likely an error.
