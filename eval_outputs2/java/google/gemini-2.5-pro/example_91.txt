The resolution combines the intents of both branches, as they are not mutually exclusive.

*   **Branch `HEAD`**'s intent is to add a configuration flag `INSECURE_ID_ALLOWED`.
*   **Branch `ed08e371978529db8a908e266dc1a8add1d37967`**'s intent is to add a configuration flag `GAME_CHAT_ENABLED`.

The initial conflict marker at the top of the snippet refers to a partial, erroneous line of code that duplicates a later, correct line. This fragment is removed. The resolution below includes both new configuration flags, resulting in functionally and syntactically correct code that honors the purpose of both changes.

```java
        .getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, BroadcastConnectsAndDisconnects.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.COOKIE_DOMAIN = '%s';\n", cookieDomain));
    boolean globalChatEnabled = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, GlobalChatEnabled.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.GLOBAL_CHAT_ENABLED = %b;\n", globalChatEnabled));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.GAME_CHAT_ENABLED = %b;\n", gameChatEnabled));
    boolean insecureIdAllowed = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, InsecureIdAllowed.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.INSECURE_ID_ALLOWED = %b;\n", insecureIdAllowed));
    boolean broadcastingUsers = injector.getInstance(Key.get(Boolean.class, BroadcastConnectsAndDisconnects.class));
    builder.append(String.format("cah.BROADCASTING_USERS = %b;\n", broadcastingUsers));
