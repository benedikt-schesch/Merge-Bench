An analysis of the merge conflict reveals that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal: importing the same set of four static methods. The only difference is the order of the `import` statements. In Java, the order of imports does not affect the functionality of the code; it is purely a matter of style.

A common and best practice for resolving such conflicts is to merge the imports from both sides, remove any duplicates, and then sort them according to a standard convention, typically alphabetical. This ensures consistency and readability. In this case, both branches import the exact same set of classes, so the resolution simply involves sorting them.

The HEAD branch has the imports in a more logical, alphabetically sorted order (`assertions.error`, `assertions.test`, `test`, `util`) compared to the incoming branch. Adopting this standard alphabetical ordering resolves the conflict cleanly by respecting the intent of both changes while enforcing a consistent code style.
