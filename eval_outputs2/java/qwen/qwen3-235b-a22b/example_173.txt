The merge conflict revolves around the generic type parameter of the `EvalFunc` class that `GFAny` extends:  
- `HEAD` proposes `EvalFunc<DataAtom>`,  
- `1488b22` proposes `EvalFunc<Integer>`.

---

**Semantic Analysis:**  
The class is named `GFAny`, hinting that it is intended to be a *general-purpose* or *generic* grouping function. In such contexts, grouping functions typically return a key that represents the group, and those keys may be of various types depending on the use case.

- `DataAtom` likely represents a flexible or generic data container, capable of wrapping multiple types. This generality supports the comment stating this is a "built-in grouping function; permits system to choose any grouping."  
- `Integer`, being a specific data type, restricts the grouping key to numeric values, which would make the grouping function less versatile unless explicitly intended.  

Given the intent implied by both the class name and the comment, `DataAtom` supports a more general and semantically appropriate use case for a function named `GFAny`.

**Resolution:**  
Based on the semantics and the likely intent behind the `GFAny` class, `EvalFunc<DataAtom>` is the appropriate generic parameter.

```java
/**
 * built-in grouping function; permits system to choose any grouping.
 */
public class GFAny extends EvalFunc<DataAtom> {
    public static final int defaultNumGroups = 1000;
    
    int numGroups = defaultNumGroups;
    Random r = new Random();
    
```
