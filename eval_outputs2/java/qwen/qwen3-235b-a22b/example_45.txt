The merge conflict originates from two methods in separate branches, each intended to serve potentially distinct functionalities for deck type identifiers in a game. Examining the context and naming semantics:

1. `getCustomDeckIds()` in the `HEAD`, returning a `Set<Integer>`, is likely for numeric identifiers of user-defined or internally-managed custom decks.

2. `getCardcastDeckIds()` in the merged commit, returning a `Set<String>`, appears to be for string-identified decks related to a Cardcast-type feature (possibly an external service or API).

**Key Resolution Insight:**  
- The differing method names and return types indicate that these methods are not semantically in conflict.
- `customDecksIds` and `cardcastDeckIds` reference two different variables, as seen from their names and types, so merging should allow both to coexist.

### Therefore, the correct resolution is to retain both methods in the post-merge code without changes.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```java
  public void updateGameSettings(final GameOptions newOptions) {
    this.options.update(newOptions);
    notifyGameOptionsChanged();
  }

  public Set<Integer> getCustomDeckIds() {
    return customDecksIds;
  }

  public Set<String> getCardcastDeckIds() {
    return cardcastDeckIds;
  }
