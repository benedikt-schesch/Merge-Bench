Here's the resolved merge conflict preserving the full context, spacing, and combining both sets of imports semantically since both sets appear to be valid and required:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

import org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.DirectoryFileFilter;
import org.jboss.netty.channel.group.ChannelGroup;
import org.jboss.netty.channel.group.ChannelGroupFuture;
import org.jboss.netty.channel.group.DefaultChannelGroup;
import org.spout.api.Engine;
import org.spout.api.Spout;
import org.spout.api.command.CommandManager;
import org.spout.api.command.CommandSource;
import org.spout.api.command.annotated.AnnotatedCommandExecutorFactory;
```

The resolution combines both sets of imports because:
1. The original imports (HEAD) provide concurrency and logging functionality
2. The new imports (67bcb76a) add file filtering capabilities and Netty networking support
3. The continued Spout imports are needed for command handling
All these imports serve distinct purposes that should co-exist in the final codebase.
