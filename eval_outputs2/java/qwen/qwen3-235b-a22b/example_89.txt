The conflict markers indicate that two different annotations (`ServerDiscoveryPort` and `AllowBlankCards`) were introduced in the same location in the file by two different branches. Both are annotated with the same metadata (`@BindingAnnotation` and `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)`), suggesting similar semantic intent — both are binding annotations meant to be available at runtime.

The presence of both annotations implies intent to define two distinct binding qualifiers. However, they are included as alternative changes to the same exact position in the file, implying a direct conflict over which annotation should occupy that space.

Since the provided snippet does not clarify whether these are alternative definitions for the same functionality (i.e., either one or the other) or whether both should coexist in separate sections of the file (which could only be determined with more context), it is not semantically clear which resolution would uphold the correct intent.

### ✅ Conclusion:
The semantic intent of both changes is ambiguous. Therefore, **we preserve the conflict markers as is**, in accordance with the instruction.
