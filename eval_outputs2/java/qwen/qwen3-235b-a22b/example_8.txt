The code conflict presents a fundamental divergence in the design and architecture of the `SpoutMetaPlugin` class as it relates to its relationship with the `Plugin` type.

---

### Conflict Overview

There are two incompatible changes:

- **`HEAD`** version **implements** `Plugin`, implying that `Plugin` is an interface.
- **`77ca2cb8`** version **extends** `Plugin`, suggesting that `Plugin` is a class — likely an abstract base class — and the subclass must inherit from it.

These two Java constructs — implementing an interface vs. extending a class — are mutually exclusive in a single class declaration and represent fundamentally different design philosophies. This conflict can only be resolved once it is known which construct (`interface` or `abstract class`) the type `org.spout.api.plugin.Plugin` embodies in the Spout API version being used.

---

### Semantic Ambiguity

From the code snippet provided, there is no definitive evidence (e.g., method overrides, abstract fields, or additional usage) that clarifies the nature of `Plugin`. Additionally:

- One branch adds new imports (`PluginLoader`, `Protocol`), likely in support of its design choice.
- The other branch introduces a constructor with parameterized initialization, often seen with extensible base classes.

Each change makes logical sense *within its own context*, but merging them requires one semantic assumption to take precedence over the other.

---

### Resolution Decision

Given the ambiguity and the lack of additional contextual information about the Spout API or other classes in the system, it's impossible to make a confident semantic merge decision. Attempting to resolve this without that clarity would risk introducing a logical inconsistency or breaking changes later in the codebase.

---

### Final Output

As per instructions, the conflicted snippet is returned unchanged to reflect the unresolved semantic ambiguity.
