The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict in the import section. The `HEAD` branch includes additional imports (`StringMap`, `StringUtil`, `ConfigurationException`), whereas the other branch removes these and leaves an empty section in that place. Since the entire file context is not provided, the intent and usage of those classes cannot be validated with certainty.

If those classes (`StringMap`, `StringUtil`, or `ConfigurationException`) are used elsewhere in the codebase, removing these imports will lead to compilation errors. On the other hand, if these classes are unused in the file, the removal is likely valid and appropriate.

Because the semantic intent behind the conflicting edits is **ambiguous without additional context**, the correct approach is to **preserve the conflict** markers as they are. This forces the developer to resolve the ambiguity manually, ensuring the safest resolution based on their knowledge of the code.
