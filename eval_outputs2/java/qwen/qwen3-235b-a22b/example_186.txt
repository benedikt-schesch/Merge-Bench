The merge conflict is due to conflicting beginnings of what appears to be two independently created files being merged into the same file path (`src/org/apache/pig/impl/plan/NodeIdGenerator.java`):

- One branch added a set of import declarations, likely for a different class (`StarSpec.java`), suggesting this could be an accidental inclusion or file misplacement.
- The other branch defined a proper `NodeIdGenerator` class, following the Java structure with the required package declaration at the top of the file, followed by the relevant imports and the class definition.

This conflict can only happen if both branches created the same file path independently, each with its own content, and not as a result of a linear modification of an existing file. Therefore, this is a classic case of **two different files competing for the same path**, rather than a partial edit conflict in an existing file.

### ✔ **Semantic Resolution Strategy**

To resolve this conflict semantically:

- **The package declaration is essential** and must appear first in a Java source file in the corresponding path. The version provided by the other branch correctly reflects the expected package `org.apache.pig.impl.plan` for that file path.
  
- The **`import java.util.Map;` and `import java.util.HashMap;`** lines are part of a proper Java source for `NodeIdGenerator`, indicating these are valid and should be included to support the implementation.
  
- In contrast, the import list from `StarSpec.java` introduces `ArrayList`, `List`, and `Properties` — these are unrelated to the `NodeIdGenerator` class intent and likely do not belong here. Including them would represent an accidental inclusion or logical inconsistency.

- The class definition starting with `public class NodeIdGenerator {` is a clear signal that the version from the other branch is the intended file in the context.

### ✅ **Final Resolved Snippet**

package org.apache.pig.impl.plan;

import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class NodeIdGenerator {
```

This resolution ensures proper alignment with Java syntax rules, preserves the intended structure of the `NodeIdGenerator` class, and respects the package conventions. It discards unrelated imports from another class definition, resolving the conflict semantically and safely.
