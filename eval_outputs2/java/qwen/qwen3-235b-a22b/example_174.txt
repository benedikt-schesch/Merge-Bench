The code snippet with merge conflicts resolved based on the semantic intent of both branches.

### Analysis:
1. The `run` method is stated to have semantic value in both branches.
2. The `HEAD` version adds the line:
    ```java
    parser.setInteractive(true);
    ```
   and retains:
    ```java
    parser.parseContOnError();
    ```
3. The content between the `=======` and the end is not explicitly defined in the input from the merged branch, thus making it safer to assume the content in the `1488b22` branch could be an implicit assumption of maintaining the `parser.parseContOnError()` call (a common base line shared implicitly).

### Resolution:
Combine or retain both modifications, prioritizing the HEAD version where clarity exists and backtracking or omitting missing or ambiguous details from the remote branch.

### Resolved Snippet:
```java
        if (in != null)
        {
            parser = new GruntParser(in);
            parser.setParams(pig);    
        }
    }

    public void run() {
        parser.setInteractive(true);
        parser.parseContOnError();
    }

    public void setConsoleReader(ConsoleReader c)
    {
        parser.setConsoleReader(c);
    }
```
