The merge conflict arises from differing intent to specify a software license header between two versions: one aiming for the Apache License 2.0 (likely inferred from the "distributed under the License..." structure common to its headers) and the other attempting to declare the legacy Apache Software License 1.1, including the associated copyright statement. Both versions intend to attach a licensing header to the file, but the licenses themselves are substantively different and not interchangeable. Resolving this would require explicit information about which licensing scheme applies to the codebase and the file in question.

Given that the problem description does not provide sufficient context to determine whether this file should retain the original Apache License 1.1, prefer Apache License 2.0 instead, or whether the licensing text was modified independently in either branch, the safe decision is to **not** assume which intent is authoritative or semantically correct.

**Conclusion**: Because the intent between the two merge sides is ambiguous from a semantic licensing standpoint, the conflict should remain unresolved and explicitly visible.
