The merge conflict occurs in a method that sends a world change message, where each branch of the merge attempts to invoke the `session.send(...)` method with a `WorldChangeMessage`. The key differences between the two implementations involve:

- One side calls `session.send(new WorldChangeMessage(world, world.getDatatable()))` without a boolean argument.
- The other calls `session.send(false, new WorldChangeMessage(world, world.getData()))` with a boolean argument.

Both versions attempt to serialize and send world information through a similar message construction strategy (`WorldChangeMessage` used in both), which implies both sides aim to notify the remote peer of a change in the world state with its associated data.

However, there are two tangible differences:

1. **Method Signature of `session.send(...)`**  
   - One branch assumes a method signature expecting **only a message** to send.
   - The other branch assumes the signature includes an **initial boolean flag**, likely indicating something like "should be reliable" or "should be compressed".

2. **Method Name for Reading World Data**  
   - One uses `world.getDatatable()`
   - The other uses `world.getData()`

---

Without precise knowledge of the current definition of `session.send(...)` in the unified codebase or of the return type of `world.getData()` and `world.getDatatable()`, it's not semantically possible to determine the correct version. The intent behind object mandates (e.g., `"Data"` or `"Datatable"`) and the meaning of the boolean flag in `session.send(...)` are not explicitly clear from the snippet. This ambiguity makes any resolution a potential runtime error or behavior deviation risk.

Given the instruction to leave the conflict markers in place **if intent is ambiguous**, the correct treatment of this conflict is to preserve the code exactly as it stands:

```java
		session.send(new EntityTransformMessage(player.getId(), new Transform(p, rot, Vector3.ONE), getRepositionManager()));
	}

	@Override
	protected void worldChanged(World world) {
<<<<<<< HEAD:src/main/java/org/spout/engine/protocol/builtin/SpoutServerNetworkSynchronizer.java
		session.send(new WorldChangeMessage(world, world.getDatatable()));
=======
		session.send(false, new WorldChangeMessage(world, world.getData()));

	@Override
	public void updateBlock(Chunk chunk, int x, int y, int z, BlockMaterial material, short data) {
		session.send(new BlockUpdateMessage(chunk.getBlock(x, y, z)));
```
