The merge conflict arises from two divergent approaches to handling the default version string when the package implementation version cannot be retrieved. Both branches catch `Exception` silently without logging, indicating the primary intent is to ensure a fallback version is returned. However, the default values differ (`"1.4"` vs `"1.2"`), and the conflict lacks sufficient context to determine which value is semantically correct or intended by the project maintainers.

Given the ambiguity in choosing between the two fallback versions and the lack of clarity on the version lineage or deployment requirements, the most appropriate resolution is to preserve the conflict markers, as no semantic reasoning can definitively favor one version over the other without further context.

```java
    @Override
    public String getVersion() {
        String version = null;
        try {
            version = ServerInfo.class.getPackage().getImplementationVersion();
<<<<<<< HEAD
        } catch (Exception e) {
        }
        return version != null ? version : "1.4";

        } catch (Exception e) {}
        return version != null ? version : "1.2";
