The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict that arises from differing assumptions about the type of the `args` variable—either a `Collection` (supporting the `.size()` method) or an array (using `.length`). Both branches are attempting to initialize a `paramTypes` array that reflects the number of arguments being passed. The shared subsequent logic—looping over `paramTypes.length` and populating it with `String.class`—relies on a consistent length that matches the actual data received in `args`.

However, since the exact type of `args` is not visible in the provided code, it is not possible to conclusively determine which branch correctly represents the intended semantics. The resolution hinges entirely on whether `args` is an array or a collection, and choosing the wrong one would introduce a compile-time error.

Therefore, in order to respect the original intent and maintain semantic correctness under ambiguity, **no attempt to resolve the conflict should be made**, and the original conflicting code must be preserved.
