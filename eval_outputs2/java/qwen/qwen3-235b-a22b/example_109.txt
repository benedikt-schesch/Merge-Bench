The merge conflict arises from differing import styles: one side explicitly lists individual classes (`Employee`, `Name`), while the other uses a wildcard import (`*`) for the same package.

Both approaches have merit:

- **Explicit imports** provide clarity on exactly what is used from the package, improving readability.
- **Wildcard imports** are less verbose and accommodate multiple or future additions from the package without needing additional import statements.

Given the lack of code using these classes beyond the import statements, there's no evidence to determine which approach reflects the better intent or consistency within the project. Therefore, the correct action is to **leave the conflict as-is**, since the resolution would be ambiguous without further context.

Here's the unresolved snippet preserved in its original full context:
