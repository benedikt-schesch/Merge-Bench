To resolve the merge conflict, we examine the intent behind the change and ensure it aligns with how the `JSONArray` object behaves in this context.

The conflict occurs on this line:

```java
final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.size());
```

vs.

```java
final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());
```

The method `formatBlackCard` takes a `JSONArray` as input, which in many implementations (e.g., `org.json.JSONArray`) provides a `length()` method to get the array's size and **not** a `size()` method. Since using `size()` would lead to a compilation error if `textParts` is indeed a `JSONArray`, the correct method to use is `length()`.

### âœ… Resolution

We resolve the conflict by choosing the correct form, based on the semantic understanding of `JSONArray` in standard libraries:

```java
final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());
```

### ðŸ“Œ Merged Snippet

Here is the full snippet, including unmodified context, with the conflict resolved:

```java
  private CustomCardFormatHelper() {
  }

  public static String formatBlackCard(final JSONArray textParts) {
    // TODO this is going to need some work to look pretty.
    final List<String> strs = new ArrayList<>(textParts.length());
    for (final Object o : textParts) {
      strs.add((String) o);
    }
    final String text = StringUtils.join(strs, "____");
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml11(text);
  }

```
