The merge conflict involves added imports in the `HEAD` version (`Component` and `CameraComponent`) conflicting with their removal in the other version (`67bcb76a`).  The resolution depends on whether classes from these imports are used in the surrounding code.  Since the provided snippet does not include the class definition and implementation using these components, the *intent* behind the change is **ambiguous**, and a semantic resolution is **not possible** with the information given. Therefore, preserving the conflict as is remains appropriate.
