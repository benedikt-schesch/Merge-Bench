The merge conflict is in the import section. The surrounding code indicates a class (`WorldFiles`) related to handling world data with NBT (Named Binary Tag) serialization. The `WORLD_VERSION = 2` suggests versioned file handling.

On one side (`HEAD`), the code has added imports to `SpoutServer` and `SpoutServerWorld`, implying server-specific logic or integration introduced in the current branch.

The other side (represented by commit `67bcb76`) does not have those imports. Since we only have context up to this point in the class and no indication of how these imports are used or what changes were introduced in the rest of the file or the rest of the project, the intent is ambiguous.

As per instructions, we must return the snippet with the conflict unresolved if we are uncertain about how to resolve it or if the intent is unclear.
