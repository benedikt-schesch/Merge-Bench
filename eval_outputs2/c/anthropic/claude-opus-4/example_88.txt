Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch (current branch) has no content between the comment and the DECL_WINDOWS_FUNCTION macro, while the incoming branch adds a TYPECHECK macro definition.

The TYPECHECK macro appears to be a utility macro that uses the sizeof operator to ensure type checking at compile time. This seems like a reasonable addition that doesn't conflict with the existing code's purpose (which is about Windows function declarations).

Since there's no actual conflict in intent - one side simply adds a macro while the other side has nothing in that location - the resolution should include the TYPECHECK macro from the incoming branch.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
 *    (However, it can't always be used, as it trips over more complicated
 *    macro trickery such as the WspiapiGetAddrInfo wrapper for getaddrinfo.)
 *
 * (DECL_WINDOWS_FUNCTION works with both these variants.)

#define TYPECHECK(to_check, to_return)                                         \
  (sizeof(to_check) ? to_return : to_return)
#define DECL_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(linkage, rettype, name, params)                  \
  typedef rettype(WINAPI *t_##name) params;                                    \
  linkage t_##name p_##name
#define STR1(x) #x
#define STR(x) STR1(x)
