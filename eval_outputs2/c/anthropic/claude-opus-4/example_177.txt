Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the context and intent of both sides.

The code appears to be handling a SOCKS proxy connection error case where either the command is not CONNECT or a reserved field is nonzero. In this error path, the code:
1. Sets a generic failure reply
2. Writes the reply to the socket
3. Closes the connection (`pfd_close(pf)`)
4. Returns from the function

The conflict is about what to return:
- HEAD wants to `return 1;` (indicating an error/failure)
- The other branch wants to `return;` (void return)

Without seeing the function signature, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict as the correct resolution depends on whether the function returns an int/bool (error code) or void. The semantic intent could be valid for either case depending on the broader codebase design.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
          if (pf->socksbuf[1] != 1 || pf->socksbuf[2] != 0) {
            /* Not CONNECT or reserved field nonzero - error */
            reply[1] = 1; /* generic failure */
            sk_write(pf->s, (char *)reply, lenof(reply));
            pfd_close(pf);
<<<<<<< HEAD
            return 1;
=======
            return;
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
          }
          /*
           * Now we have a viable connect request. Switch
           * on atype.
           */
```
