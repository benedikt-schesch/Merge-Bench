Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to document what causes directory operations to be synchronous. The conflict is in the comment explaining the relationship between the mount option `dirsync` and synchronous directory operations.

- HEAD version: "=> mount option dirsync, which causes directory operations e.g. mkdir to be synchronous"
- Other version: "caused by mount option dirsync, which causes directory operations e.g. mkdir to be synchronous"

The key difference is:
- HEAD uses "=>" (implies/leads to)
- Other uses "caused by"

Both are trying to explain that the `dirsync` mount option causes directory operations to be synchronous. The "caused by" version seems more grammatically complete and clear in this context, as it's explaining what causes the synchronous behavior mentioned in the previous comment about version 2.3.

Here's the resolved version:

```c
 *
 * If the datasync parameter is non-zero, then only the user data
 * should be flushed, not the meta data
 *
 * Introduced in version 2.3
 * caused by mount option dirsync, which causes directory operations e.g. mkdir to be synchronous
 */

int sfs_fsyncdir(const char *path, int datasync, struct fuse_file_info *fi) {
	int retstat = 0;
	DIR *dp;

```
