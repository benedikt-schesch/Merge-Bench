Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD side: Sets `column = 2` and uses `td->addbutton`
- Other side: Sets `column = 1` and uses `td->setbutton`

Without more context about the intent and semantics of this code, I cannot determine which column value is correct or whether `addbutton` or `setbutton` is the appropriate choice. The conflict appears to involve both a layout decision (column position) and a functional decision (which button to use).

Since the intent is ambiguous and I cannot determine the correct resolution without understanding the broader context of what this UI code is meant to achieve, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
                                100,
                                HELPCTX(ssh_ttymodes),
                                ttymodes_handler,
                                P(td),
                                P(NULL));
<<<<<<< HEAD
      td->valbox->generic.column = 2;
      ctrl_tabdelay(s, td->addbutton);
=======
      td->valbox->generic.column = 1;
      ctrl_tabdelay(s, td->setbutton);
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
    }

    if (!midsession) {
      /*
