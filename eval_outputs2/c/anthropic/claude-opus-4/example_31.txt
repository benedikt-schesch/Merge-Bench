Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to access the node's data and assign it to variable `c`. The only difference is:
- HEAD version explicitly casts to `(connection_t *)`
- The other branch removes the cast

Since C allows implicit void pointer conversions, both achieve the same semantic result. The trend in modern C is to avoid unnecessary casts for void pointers. Therefore, I'll resolve this by using the version without the cast:

```c
			}

			/* Close connections to hosts that have a changed or deleted host config file */
			
			for(node = connection_tree->head; node; node = node->next) {
				c = node->data;
				
				if(c->outgoing) {
					free(c->outgoing->name);
					freeaddrinfo(c->outgoing->ai);
					free(c->outgoing);

```
