```c
  int sending;
  int portnumber = -1;
  int *fdlist;
  int fd;
  int i, fdcount, fdsize, fdstate;
  int connopen;
  int exitcode;
  int errors;
  int use_subsystem = 0;
  int got_host = FALSE;
  int just_test_share_exists = FALSE;

```

The resolution here is straightforward - the HEAD branch added the `int connopen;` variable declaration, while the other branch (4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5) did not have this addition. Since this is simply a variable declaration with no conflicting changes, the semantic intent is to include the new variable. Therefore, I've kept the `int connopen;` line in the resolved version.
