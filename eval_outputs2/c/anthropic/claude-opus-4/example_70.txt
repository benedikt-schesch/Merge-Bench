Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call the same function with the same arguments, but they disagree on the function name:

- HEAD version: `LBItemFromPt`
- Other version: `p_LBItemFromPt`

The `p_` prefix typically indicates a function pointer or a dynamically loaded function (often used when dealing with Windows APIs that might not be available on all systems). Since this appears to be a Windows API function (`LBItemFromPt` is a Windows ComCtl32 function), the `p_` version is likely the correct one if the codebase is using dynamic loading for compatibility reasons.

Given that the semantics and intent are identical (both are calling the same function with the same parameters), and the `p_` prefix suggests a deliberate architectural decision for dynamic loading, I'll resolve this in favor of the `p_LBItemFromPt` version:

```c
         * FIXME: this causes scrollbar glitches if the count of
         *        listbox contains >= its height. */
        hdl->dummyitem =
            SendDlgItemMessage(hwnd, hdl->listid, LB_ADDSTRING, 0, (LPARAM) "");

        hdl->srcitem = p_LBItemFromPt(dlm->hWnd, dlm->ptCursor, TRUE);
        hdl->dragging = 0;
        /* XXX hack Q183115 */
        SetWindowLongPtr(hwnd, DWLP_MSGRESULT, TRUE);
        ret |= 1;
        break;

```
