Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD** (current branch): When a write error occurs, it logs the error and then calls `fatalbox()` to terminate the program with an error message.
- **Other branch**: When a write error occurs, it notifies the plug layer about the closing event and returns 0.

The key difference is in error handling strategy:
- HEAD takes a fatal approach - terminate the program
- The other branch takes a graceful approach - notify and return

Without more context about the overall error handling strategy of the codebase, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The two approaches are fundamentally different in their philosophy (fatal vs. graceful error handling).

Here's the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
    int len, ret;

    bufchain_prefix(&ps->pending_output_data, &data, &len);
    ret = write(ps->to_cmd, data, len);
    if (ret < 0 && errno != EWOULDBLOCK) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      /* We're inside the Unix frontend here, so we know
       * that the frontend handle is unnecessary. */
      logevent(NULL, strerror(errno));
      fatalbox("%s", strerror(errno));
=======
      plug_closing(ps->plug, strerror(errno), errno, 0);
      return 0;

    } else if (ret <= 0) {
      break;
    } else {
      bufchain_consume(&ps->pending_output_data, ret);
      sent += ret;
```
