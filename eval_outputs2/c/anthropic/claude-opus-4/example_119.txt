Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to format `term->esc_args[i]` into a string buffer using `sprintf`. The only difference is:
- HEAD uses `%d` (signed integer format)
- The other branch uses `%u` (unsigned integer format)

This appears to be a fix where someone realized that `term->esc_args[i]` should be treated as unsigned rather than signed. The `%u` format specifier is likely the correct choice here, as escape sequence arguments are typically non-negative values.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
              char lbuf[64];
              strcpy(term->id_string, "\033[?");
              for (i = 1; i < term->esc_nargs; i++) {
                if (i != 1)
                  strcat(term->id_string, ";");
                sprintf(lbuf, "%u", term->esc_args[i]);
                strcat(term->id_string, lbuf);
              }
              strcat(term->id_string, "c");
            }
#if 0

```
