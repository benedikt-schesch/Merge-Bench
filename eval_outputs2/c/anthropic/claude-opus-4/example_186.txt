Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Has a commented-out line `//fuse_opt_add_arg(outargs, "--version");`
- The incoming branch: Removes that line entirely

Both sides appear to agree that this `fuse_opt_add_arg` call should not be executed. The only difference is whether to keep it as a comment or remove it completely.

Since both sides have the same semantic intent (not executing that line), and the incoming branch chose to clean it up by removing it entirely, I'll resolve by taking the cleaner approach and removing the line:

```c
		if (setuid(state->uid) == -1) {
			syslog(LOG_ERR, "unable to drop privileges to uid %i", state->uid);
			abort();
		}

		syslog(LOG_NOTICE, "Drop privileges to uid=%i, gid=%i\n", state->uid, state->gid);
	}

	if (!state->perm_checks && (getuid() == 0 || geteuid() == 0)) {
		syslog(LOG_ERR, "[main] cannot run as root without --perms");

```
