Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the conflict is about whether to include a `SetHandleInformation` call after socket creation.

The HEAD version (current branch) doesn't have this call, while the incoming change adds:
```c
SetHandleInformation((HANDLE)s, HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT, 0);
```

This function call is disabling handle inheritance for the socket, which is typically a good security practice in Windows to prevent child processes from inadvertently inheriting socket handles.

Since this appears to be a beneficial addition that doesn't conflict with the surrounding logic (it's just adding a configuration step after socket creation and before setting socket options), I'll resolve by accepting the incoming change:

```c
    err = p_WSAGetLastError();
    ret->error = winsock_error_string(err);
    return (Socket)ret;
  }

  SetHandleInformation((HANDLE)s, HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT, 0);

  ret->oobinline = 0;

  p_setsockopt(s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, (const char *)&on, sizeof(on));

#ifndef NO_IPV6
