Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Wants the function to return 1
- **Incoming change** (4348393f5...): Wants the function to have no return statement (implying void return)

Without more context about the function signature and its usage, it's difficult to determine which is semantically correct. The conflict represents a fundamental disagreement about whether this function should return a value or not.

Since I cannot determine the correct intent without knowing:
1. The function signature (does it declare a return type?)
2. How the function is called (do callers expect a return value?)
3. The broader codebase conventions

I'm returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact:

```c
      rlogin->firstbyte = 0;
    }
    if (len > 0)
      c_write(rlogin, data, len);
  }
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return 1;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

static void rlogin_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  Rlogin rlogin = (Rlogin)plug;

```
