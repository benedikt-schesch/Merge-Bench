Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to check conditions before setting up stdin for reading. The key difference is that HEAD includes an additional `connopen &&` condition at the beginning of the if statement.

The intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants to ensure that `connopen` is true before proceeding with the other checks
- The other branch removed this `connopen` check, suggesting it may not be necessary or was intentionally removed

Without more context about what `connopen` represents and why it was removed in one branch, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The semantic intent is ambiguous - was `connopen` removed because it's redundant, or was it added in HEAD for an important reason?

Here is the same snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
    FD_ZERO(&xset);
    maxfd = 0;

    FD_SET_MAX(signalpipe[0], maxfd, rset);

<<<<<<< HEAD
    if (connopen && !sending && back->connected(backhandle) &&
        back->sendok(backhandle) &&
=======
    if (!sending && back->connected(backhandle) && back->sendok(backhandle) &&
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
        back->sendbuffer(backhandle) < MAX_STDIN_BACKLOG) {
      /* If we're OK to send, then try to read from stdin. */
      FD_SET_MAX(STDIN_FILENO, maxfd, rset);
    }
