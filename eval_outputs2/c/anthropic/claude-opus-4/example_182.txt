Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides of the merge have identical content - they both declare the same variables and call the same function. The only difference is the indentation style:

- HEAD uses tabs for indentation
- The other branch uses spaces (4 spaces) for indentation

Since the semantic intent is identical on both sides, I'll preserve the HEAD version to maintain consistency with the surrounding code, which appears to use tabs (as seen in the `return retstat;` line above and the `BEGIN_PERM;` line below).

```c
	return retstat;
}

/** Remove extended attributes */
int sfs_removexattr(const char *path, const char *name) {
	int retstat = 0;
	char fpath[PATH_MAX];
	sfs_fullpath(fpath, path);

	BEGIN_PERM;
	retstat = lremovexattr(fpath, name);
	END_PERM;
	if (retstat < 0) {

```
