Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the case where `val` exists but with different approaches:

- HEAD assumes that if we're in the `else` branch, we should call `do_mode` with `val + 1`
- The incoming change adds a check to ensure `val[0] == 'V'` before calling `do_mode`, and includes a comment explaining that it ignores 'N' or unknown future values

The incoming change is more defensive and explicit about when to process the value, which seems like the better approach as it prevents potential issues with unexpected values.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```c
      val = get_ttymode(ssh->frontend, mode->mode);
      if (val) {
        do_mode(data, mode, val);
        sfree(val);
      }
    } else if (val[0] == 'V') {
      do_mode(data, mode, val + 1); /* skip the 'V' */
    } /* else 'N', or something from the future we don't understand */
  }
}

static int ssh_channelcmp(void *av, void *bv)
