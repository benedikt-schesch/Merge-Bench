Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to access the same data from `node->data`, but with slightly different syntax:

- HEAD version: Uses an explicit cast `(connection_t *) node->data`
- Other version: Uses direct assignment without a cast `node->data`

Both versions have the same semantic intent - to assign the node's data to variable `c`. The difference is purely stylistic (explicit cast vs. implicit). Since modern C compilers handle void pointer assignments well and the code appears to work without the cast, I'll resolve this by choosing the cleaner, more concise version without the cast.

```c

	FD_ZERO(fs);

	for(node = connection_tree->head; node; node = next) {
		next = node->next;
		c = node->data;

		if(c->status.remove) {
			connection_del(c);
			if(!connection_tree->head)
				purge();

```
