Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- The HEAD branch has nothing after the `fromxdigit` macro definition
- The incoming branch (fc089d5df...) adds a comment and a constant declaration `buildinfo_gtk_relevant`

Since these changes don't conflict semantically (one side adds nothing, the other adds new code), the resolution should include the additions from the incoming branch.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
  modalfatalbox("random_byte called in testbn");
  return 0;
}

#define fromxdigit(c) ((c) > '9' ? ((c)&0xDF) - 'A' + 10 : (c) - '0')

/* For Unix in particular, but harmless if this main() is reused elsewhere */
const int buildinfo_gtk_relevant = FALSE;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *buf;
  int line = 0;

```
