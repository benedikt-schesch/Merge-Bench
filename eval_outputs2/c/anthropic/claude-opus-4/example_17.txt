Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are modifying the usage string for a command-line application. The conflict is in the `printf` statement within the `usage` function.

Comparing both versions:
- HEAD version includes: `[-u/--unbuffered]` option
- The incoming change (05f934d5...) does not include this option
- Everything else in the format string is identical

Since the HEAD version appears to be adding a new command-line option (`-u/--unbuffered`) that wasn't present in the other branch, and this seems to be an intentional feature addition, the semantic intent would be to keep this new option.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
        exit(1);
    }
}

void usage(const char* app) {
    printf("usage: %s [-d/--debug] [-i/--id device_id] -b/--bundle bundle.app [-a/--args arguments] [-t/--timeout timeout(seconds)] [-u/--unbuffered] [-x path to Xcode's Developer directory]\n", app);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    static struct option longopts[] = {
        { "debug", no_argument, NULL, 'd' },

```
