Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- The HEAD branch calls `age_mac()` when in RMODE_SWITCH mode
- The incoming branch calls `age_subnets()` when in RMODE_SWITCH mode

Without more context about the codebase and the intent of these changes, I cannot definitively determine which function should be called or if both should be called. The conflict appears to be about which aging function is appropriate for RMODE_SWITCH mode.

Since the intent is ambiguous without additional context, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
		if(last_ping_check + pingtimeout < now) {
			check_dead_connections();
			last_ping_check = now;

			if(routing_mode == RMODE_SWITCH)
<<<<<<< HEAD
				age_mac();
=======
				age_subnets();
>>>>>>> af86a3226ea42375644b3f99c182c778d327de1e

			age_past_requests();

			/* Should we regenerate our key? */
