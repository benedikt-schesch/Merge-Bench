Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one branch (the feature branch) is trying to add an `extern bool tunnelserver;` declaration between the struct definition and the comment about maximum string size.

Since this appears to be a simple addition of a global variable declaration with no conflicting changes, the semantic intent seems clear - to make the `tunnelserver` variable accessible in this context. The resolution would be to include this declaration.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
typedef struct past_request_t {
	char *request;
	time_t firstseen;
} past_request_t;

extern bool tunnelserver;

/* Maximum size of strings in a request */

#define MAX_STRING_SIZE 2048
#define MAX_STRING "%2048s"


```
