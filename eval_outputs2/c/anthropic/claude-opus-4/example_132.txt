Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the `x11_receive` function, but they disagree on:
1. The return type (`int` vs `void`)
2. The function body (HEAD has `return 0;` while the other branch has an empty body)

Since the HEAD version returns `int` and has a `return 0;` statement, while the other branch expects `void` with no return, this appears to be a semantic conflict about what the function should do. Without more context about the intended behavior or the surrounding codebase conventions, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
                    int port,
                    const char *error_msg,
                    int error_code)
{
}
<<<<<<< HEAD
static int x11_receive(Plug plug, int urgent, char *data, int len)
{
  return 0;
