Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to access the `data` field of `enode`, but they differ in whether to use an explicit cast to `(edge_t *)`.

The semantic intent is the same - both versions are retrieving an edge from the node's data field. The difference is purely stylistic:
- The HEAD version uses an explicit cast: `e = (edge_t *) enode->data;`
- The incoming version omits the cast: `e = enode->data;`

Since modern C compilers handle void pointer conversions automatically, and the intent is identical, I'll resolve this by choosing the cleaner version without the cast:

```c

		if(!n->status.reachable) {
			for(enode = edge_weight_tree->head; enode; enode = enext) {
				enext = enode->next;
				e = enode->data;

				if(e->to == n)
					break;
			}


```
