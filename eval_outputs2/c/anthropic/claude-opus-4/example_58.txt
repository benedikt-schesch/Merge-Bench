Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to set the `column` property of `td->valradio->generic`, but with different values:
- HEAD wants to set it to 1
- The incoming change wants to set it to 0

Without more context about the layout system and the intent behind these changes, I cannot determine which value is semantically correct. The conflict appears to be a genuine disagreement about the positioning/layout of this UI element.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

                                       P(NULL),
                                       NULL);
<<<<<<< HEAD

      td->valbox = ctrl_editbox(s,
                                NULL,
                                NO_SHORTCUT,
                                100,
                                HELPCTX(ssh_ttymodes),
