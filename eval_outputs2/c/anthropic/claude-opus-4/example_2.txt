Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - iterating through items in a data structure. The key differences are:

1. **HEAD**: Uses `(child+i)->count` and stores it in a local variable `count`
2. **Branch**: Uses `data->count` directly in the loop condition

Since `data` is already defined as `get_data(child+i)`, both `(child+i)->count` and `data->count` should refer to the same value. The branch version is cleaner as it uses the already-fetched `data` pointer rather than dereferencing through `child+i` again.

The only other difference is formatting (brace placement), where the branch version follows a more compact style.

Here's the resolved version using the cleaner approach from the branch:

```c
    int i, j;
    for (i=0; i<BUCKET_SIZE; i++)
    {
        Data *data = get_data(child+i);
        Item *it = data->head;
        for (j=0; j < data->count; j++){
            if (it->ver > 0) {
                add_item(tree, node, it, key_hash(tree, it), false);
            } // drop deleted items, ver < 0
            it = (Item*)((char*)it + it->length);
        }
        clear(child + i);

```
