Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- The HEAD version (current branch) continues execution after printing the error message
- The incoming change adds `return 0;` after the error message, indicating it wants to exit the function when the directory cannot be opened

The semantic intent of the incoming change is clearer and more correct - if we cannot open the directory (`dirh == NULL`), we should exit the function rather than continue to the else block. This is a common error handling pattern.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
  pktin = sftp_wait_for_reply(req);
  dirh = fxp_opendir_recv(pktin, req);

  if (dirh == NULL) {
    printf("Unable to open %s: %s\n", dir, fxp_error());
    return 0;
  } else {
    nnames = namesize = 0;
    ournames = NULL;

    while (1) {

```
