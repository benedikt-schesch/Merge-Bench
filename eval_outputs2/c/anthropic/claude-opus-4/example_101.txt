Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define a `types` variable that contains the characters 'A', 'N', and 'V'. The semantic intent is the same - to provide these three type options for the radiobutton selection.

The HEAD version uses a string literal `"ANV"`, while the other branch uses a character array `{'A', 'N', 'V'}`. Both approaches work with the subsequent code that indexes into `types` using `types[button]`.

Since both achieve the same semantic goal and the string literal approach is more concise while still being compatible with the array indexing operation, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```c
      const char *key;
      char *str, *val;
      char type;

      {
        const char *types = "ANV";
        int button = dlg_radiobutton_get(td->valradio, dlg);
        assert(button >= 0 && button < lenof(types));
        type = types[button];
      }


```
