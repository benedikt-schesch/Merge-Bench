Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to address a security concern when loading Windows DLLs. The HEAD version has the basic implementation, while the incoming change adds an important security fix to prevent DLL hijacking by ensuring `sspicli.dll` is loaded from the correct system directory before `GetUserNameExA` is called.

The semantic intent is clear: both sides want to load `GetUserNameExA` from `secur32.dll`, but the incoming change adds a crucial security improvement. This should be merged by including both changes.

Here's the resolved version:

```c
  {
    static int tried_usernameex = FALSE;
    if (!tried_usernameex) {
      /* Not available on Win9x, so load dynamically */
      HMODULE secur32 = load_system32_dll("secur32.dll");
      /* If MIT Kerberos is installed, the following call to
         GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION makes Windows implicitly load
         sspicli.dll WITHOUT proper path sanitizing, so better
         load it properly before */
      HMODULE sspicli = load_system32_dll("sspicli.dll");
      GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(secur32, GetUserNameExA);
      tried_usernameex = TRUE;
    }
  }
