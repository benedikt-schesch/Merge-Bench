Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) adds a `return 1;` statement after the if block and then another `return 1;` at the end, while the other side removes both return statements.

Based on the semantic intent, it appears that:
- HEAD wants to ensure the function returns 1 in all cases
- The other branch seems to have removed the returns, possibly because the function signature changed or the return value is no longer needed

Since both sides seem to have valid but conflicting intents, and without seeing the full function signature or understanding the broader context of why these changes were made, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
    }
  } else if (event == 2) {
    assert(fd == s->to_cmd);
    if (localproxy_try_send(s))
      plug_sent(s->plug, bufchain_size(&s->pending_output_data));
