Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch) wants to return 1 from this function
- The incoming branch (4348393f) wants to remove the return statement entirely

Given the context, this appears to be a callback or event handler function that's part of a socket listening mechanism. The function handles errors and closes the listening socket.

The key insight is that the next function `pageant_listen_accepting` has a return type of `int`, which suggests that functions in this plug interface are expected to return an integer value. This is a common pattern in C for callbacks where the return value indicates success/failure or whether to continue processing.

Since HEAD wants to return a value and the function appears to be part of a callback interface that likely expects a return value, the safer semantic resolution is to keep the return statement.

```c
  struct pageant_listen_state *pl = (struct pageant_listen_state *)plug;
  if (error_msg)
    plog(pl->logctx, pl->logfn, "listening socket: error: %s", error_msg);
  sk_close(pl->listensock);
  pl->listensock = NULL;
  return 1;
}

static int pageant_listen_accepting(Plug plug,
                                    accept_fn_t constructor,
                                    accept_ctx_t ctx)

```
