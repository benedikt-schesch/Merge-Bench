Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the copyright year in the eAccelerator extension. The HEAD version has updated the copyright to 2015, while the other branch has it at 2014. 

Since the HEAD version has the more recent year (2015), which would be the appropriate update for a copyright notice, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```c
ZEND_DLEXPORT zend_extension zend_extension_entry = {
    EACCELERATOR_EXTENSION_NAME,
    EACCELERATOR_VERSION,
    "eAccelerator",
    "http://eaccelerator.net",
    "Copyright (c) 2004-2015 eAccelerator",
    eaccelerator_zend_startup,
    NULL,
    NULL,   /* void (*activate)() */
    NULL,   /* void (*deactivate)() */
    NULL,   /* void (*message_handle)(int message, void *arg) */

```
