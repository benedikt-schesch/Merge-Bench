Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the error case and the not-connected case, but they differ in:

1. The HEAD version uses `return` statements
2. The other version (4348393f) doesn't use `return` statements

This suggests the function's return type likely changed between these versions - HEAD appears to expect a return value while the other version suggests a void function.

Without knowing the function signature or more context, I cannot determine which approach is correct. The semantic intent is unclear because both versions handle the same conditions but with different control flow expectations.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c

          while (err && s->addr && sk_nextaddr(s->addr, &s->step)) {
            err = try_connect(s);
          }
          if (err)
<<<<<<< HEAD
            return plug_closing(s->plug, strerror(err), err, 0);
          if (!s->connected)
            return 0; /* another async attempt in progress */
=======
            plug_closing(s->plug, strerror(err), err, 0);
          if (!s->connected)
            return; /* another async attempt in progress */
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
        }
      }

      /*
