Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the context and intent of both sides.

The conflict appears to be at the end of a function. The HEAD branch has `return 0;` while the other branch (4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5) has removed this line entirely.

From the context, this appears to be the end of a function that:
1. Sets `raw->sent_console_eof = TRUE`
2. Calls `raw_check_close(raw)`
3. Then either returns 0 (HEAD) or has no return statement (other branch)

The next function `raw_receive` is defined as `static void`, suggesting this codebase uses void for functions that don't return values. This gives a clue that the function in conflict might also be void, making the removal of `return 0;` the correct resolution.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
      }
    }
    raw->sent_console_eof = TRUE;
    raw_check_close(raw);
  }
}

static void raw_receive(Plug plug, int urgent, char *data, int len)
{
  Raw raw = (Raw)plug;

```
