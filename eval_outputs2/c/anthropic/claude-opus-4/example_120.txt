Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to fix what appears to be a logging statement issue. The conflict is in a `LOG` macro call where:

- HEAD version: `LOG(("  subtree has only one element!\n", ki));` - includes a second argument `ki`
- Other version: `LOG(("  subtree has only one element!\n"));` - removes the second argument

The issue appears to be that the format string doesn't contain any format specifiers (like `%d`), so the `ki` argument in the HEAD version would be unused. The other branch correctly removes this unnecessary argument.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
       * we have to do some transformation to start with.
       */
      LOG(("  moving to subtree %d\n", ki));
      sub = n->kids[ki];
      if (!sub->elems[1]) {
        LOG(("  subtree has only one element!\n"));
        if (ki > 0 && n->kids[ki - 1]->elems[1]) {
          /*
           * Case 3a, left-handed variant. Child ki has
           * only one element, but child ki-1 has two or
           * more. So we need to move a subtree from ki-1

```
