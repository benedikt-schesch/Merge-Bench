Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

**HEAD (current branch)**: Returns a value from `plug_closing()` when there's an error, and returns 1 when there's no error.

**Incoming change**: Calls `plug_closing()` when there's an error (without using its return value) and then returns void.

The key difference is whether this function should return a value or be void. Looking at the context, the HEAD version seems more complete as it handles both the error case (return the result of `plug_closing()`) and the success case (return 1).

However, since the incoming change suggests this function should be void (just `return;`), and without seeing the full function signature or how it's called, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
      while (err && s->addr && sk_nextaddr(s->addr, &s->step)) {
        err = try_connect(s);
      }
    }
    if (err != 0)
<<<<<<< HEAD
      return plug_closing(s->plug, winsock_error_string(err), err, 0);
    else
      return 1;
=======
      plug_closing(s->plug, winsock_error_string(err), err, 0);
    return;
