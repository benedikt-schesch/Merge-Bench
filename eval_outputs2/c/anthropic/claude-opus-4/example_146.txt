Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - formatting a sprintf statement with two integer values. The key difference is that one side (the branch) is adding explicit `(int)` casts to the values being printed.

The HEAD version:
```c
blen = sprintf(before, "{\\uc%d\\u%d", multilen, udata[uindex]);
```

The branch version:
```c
blen = sprintf(before, "{\\uc%d\\u%d", (int)multilen, (int)udata[uindex]);
```

The branch version is being more explicit about type casting, which is likely to avoid compiler warnings about type mismatches or to ensure proper formatting. This is a common defensive programming practice when the types of `multilen` or `udata[uindex]` might not be exactly `int`.

Since the intent is the same (format these values as integers) and the branch version is more explicit and safer, I'll resolve in favor of the branch version with the explicit casts:

```c
        blen = alen = 0;
      } else {
        multilen = WideCharToMultiByte(
            CP_ACP, 0, unitab + uindex, 1, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL);
        if (multilen != 1) {
          blen = sprintf(
              before, "{\\uc%d\\u%d", (int)multilen, (int)udata[uindex]);
          alen = 1;
          strcpy(after, "}");
        } else {
          blen = sprintf(before, "\\u%d", udata[uindex]);
          alen = 0;
```
