Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to destroy the old items after moving them, but using different approaches:

- HEAD uses `std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy(alloc, &old_items[i])`
- The other branch uses direct destructor call `old_items[i].~T()`

Both achieve the same semantic goal of destroying the moved-from objects. The `std::allocator_traits::destroy` approach is more generic and follows modern C++ best practices as it allows allocators to customize destruction behavior if needed. Since this code is already using allocator-aware patterns (seen in `alloc.allocate()`), the HEAD version is more consistent with the overall design.

```c
        /* reallocate and copy items */
        T* old_items = items;
        items = alloc.allocate(new_alloced);
        for (size_t i=0; i<size_active; i++) {
          ::new (&items[i]) T(std::move(old_items[i]));
          std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy(alloc, &old_items[i]);
        }

        for (size_t i=size_active; i<new_active; i++) {
          ::new (&items[i]) T;
        }
