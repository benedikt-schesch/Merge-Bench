Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to initialize common controls, but with different function names:
- HEAD uses `InitCommonControls()` (Windows API style with PascalCase)
- The other branch uses `init_common_controls()` (lowercase with underscores)

Given the surrounding context with other function calls using lowercase_with_underscores style (`sk_init()` and `set_explicit_app_user_model_id()`), it appears the codebase is following a consistent naming convention. The intent is the same - to initialize common controls - so I'll resolve this by using the lowercase version to maintain consistency.

```c
  hwnd = NULL;
  flags = FLAG_VERBOSE | FLAG_INTERACTIVE;

  sk_init();

  init_common_controls();

  /* Set Explicit App User Model Id so that jump lists don't cause
     PuTTY to hang on to removable media. */

  set_explicit_app_user_model_id();

```
