Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the semantic intent of both sides:

- The HEAD branch adds a `return 1;` statement after the if block
- The other branch (4348393f5...) removes this return statement

Since this appears to be at the end of a function (given that the next line starts a new function `x11_sent`), and considering that both sides seem to have valid intentions, I cannot determine with certainty which behavior is correct without more context about the function's purpose and return type.

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
  if (sshfwd_write(xconn->c, data, len) > 0) {
    xconn->throttled = 1;
    xconn->no_data_sent_to_x_client = FALSE;
    sk_set_frozen(xconn->s, 1);
  }
<<<<<<< HEAD

  return 1;

}

static void x11_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  struct X11Connection *xconn = (struct X11Connection *)plug;

```
