Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Uses `dir` in the printf statement
- **Right side (commit 4348393...)**: Uses `cmd->words[i]` in the printf statement

The semantic issue here is that `dir` is the result of `canonify(cmd->words[i])`, but the code has already checked that `dir` is NULL (in the `if (!dir)` condition). So using `dir` in the printf statement would be printing NULL, which is incorrect.

The right side correctly uses `cmd->words[i]` to show the original input that failed to canonify, which provides more useful error information to the user.

Here's the resolved code:

```c

  ret = 1;
  for (i = 1; i < cmd->nwords; i++) {
    dir = canonify(cmd->words[i]);
    if (!dir) {
      printf("%s: canonify: %s\n", cmd->words[i], fxp_error());
      return 0;
    }

    req = fxp_mkdir_send(dir);
    pktin = sftp_wait_for_reply(req);

```
