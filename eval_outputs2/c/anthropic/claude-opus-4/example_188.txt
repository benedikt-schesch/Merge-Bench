Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- The HEAD version simply returns `MRAA_SUCCESS` after the write operation
- The incoming change adds a conditional check for a post-write callback function (`advance_func.gpio_write_post`) and calls it if it exists

The semantic intent appears to be that the incoming change wants to add support for a post-write hook/callback mechanism that can be executed after the GPIO write operation completes successfully. This is a common pattern for extensibility.

Since both sides want the write operation to succeed, and the incoming change adds additional functionality without breaking the existing behavior, the resolution should include the callback check.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
    int length = snprintf(bu, sizeof(bu), "%d", value);
    if (write(dev->value_fp, bu, length*sizeof(char)) == -1) {
        return MRAA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE;
    }

    if (advance_func.gpio_write_post != NULL)
        return advance_func.gpio_write_post(dev,value);
    return MRAA_SUCCESS;
}

static mraa_result_t
mraa_gpio_unexport_force(mraa_gpio_context dev)

```
