Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch adds a declaration for `select_result(WPARAM, LPARAM)` while the other branch removes or doesn't include it. Based on the context showing socket handling and the comment below about `select_result()`, it appears the function declaration is needed for the code that follows.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```c
      handle_got_event(handles[n - WAIT_OBJECT_0]);
    } else if (n == WAIT_OBJECT_0 + nhandles) {
      WSANETWORKEVENTS things;
      SOCKET socket;
      extern SOCKET first_socket(int *), next_socket(int *);
      extern int select_result(WPARAM, LPARAM);
      int i, socketstate;

      /*
       * We must not call select_result() for any socket
       * until we have finished enumerating within the tree.

```
