Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has an additional extern declaration for `select_result(WPARAM, LPARAM)` that the other branch doesn't have.

Since this appears to be a function declaration that will likely be used later in the code (given the comment about "We must not call select_result()"), and since extern declarations don't create conflicts if unused, the safest semantic resolution is to keep the declaration from HEAD.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
    handle_got_event(handles[n - WAIT_OBJECT_0]);
  } else if (netindex >= 0 && n == WAIT_OBJECT_0 + netindex) {
    WSANETWORKEVENTS things;
    SOCKET socket;
    extern SOCKET first_socket(int *), next_socket(int *);
    extern int select_result(WPARAM, LPARAM);
    int i, socketstate;

    /*
     * We must not call select_result() for any socket
     * until we have finished enumerating within the
```
