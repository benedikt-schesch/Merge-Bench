Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to access the same data from `event_tree->head->data`, but they differ in whether to use an explicit cast to `(event_t *)`.

The HEAD version includes an explicit cast to `(event_t *)`, while the incoming change removes this cast. Since both versions are functionally equivalent (assuming `event_tree->head->data` is already of the correct type or implicitly convertible), and modern C practices often prefer to avoid unnecessary casts, I'll resolve this by accepting the cleaner version without the cast.

```c

		if(sigalrm) {
			logger(LOG_INFO, _("Flushing event queue"));

			while(event_tree->head) {
				event = event_tree->head->data;
				event->handler(event->data);
				event_del(event);
			}
			sigalrm = false;
		}

```
