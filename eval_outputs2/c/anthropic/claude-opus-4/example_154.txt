Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version declares two variables `int ret, open;` while the other branch only declares `int ret;`. The conflict is about whether to include the `open` variable declaration.

Without more context about how these variables are used in the rest of the function, I cannot determine the correct resolution. The `open` variable might be needed for functionality added in HEAD, or it might have been removed in the other branch for a good reason.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
    try_send(s);
}

void select_result(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
<<<<<<< HEAD
  int ret, open;
=======
  int ret;
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
  DWORD err;
  char buf[20480]; /* nice big buffer for plenty of speed */
  Actual_Socket s;
  u_long atmark;
