Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to fix the same issue - ensuring proper formatting in the printf statement. 

The HEAD version has reformatted the printf call to span multiple lines, while the other branch (4348393f) has also reformatted it AND added a cast `(unsigned)` to the variable `l`.

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want better code formatting
2. The branch 4348393f also wants to ensure `l` is treated as unsigned in the printf

Since the cast to `(unsigned)` is likely fixing a potential sign/format specifier issue (using %08x which expects unsigned), the semantically correct resolution should include both the formatting and the cast.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
      printf("%d: correct string shorter than output\n", line);
      total_errs++;
      break;
    }
    if (l != str[i]) {
      printf("%d: char %d came out as %08x, should be %08x\n",
             line,
             i,
             str[i],
             (unsigned)l);
      total_errs++;
    }
  }
  if (l != -1) {
    l = va_arg(ap, long int);

```
