Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides of the merge are trying to achieve the same thing - they're both implementing the same function with identical logic. The only difference is the indentation style:

- HEAD uses tabs for indentation
- The other branch (6ffa9ed1f1c5bd00eeb732e207b2dcbadc7c87fc) uses spaces for indentation

Since the surrounding context uses tabs (as seen in the `BEGIN_PERM;`, `retstat = llistxattr...`, and `END_PERM;` lines), I'll resolve this conflict by keeping the version with tabs for consistency.

```c
	return retstat;
}

/** List extended attributes */
int sfs_listxattr(const char *path, char *list, size_t size) {
	int retstat = 0;
	char fpath[PATH_MAX];
	sfs_fullpath(fpath, path);

	BEGIN_PERM;
	retstat = llistxattr(fpath, list, size);
	END_PERM;
	if (retstat < 0) {

```
