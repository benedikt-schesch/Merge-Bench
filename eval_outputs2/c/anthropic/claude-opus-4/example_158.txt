Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same URL, with the only difference being the protocol:

- HEAD wants: `http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/`
- The other branch wants: `https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/`

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both want to open the PuTTY website. The conflict is simply about whether to use HTTP or HTTPS. In modern web development, HTTPS is the preferred protocol for security reasons, and most sites redirect HTTP to HTTPS anyway.

Since HTTPS is the more secure and modern choice, I'll resolve this by choosing the HTTPS version:

```c
      return 0;
    case 102:
      /* Load web browser */
      ShellExecute(hwnd,
                   "open",
                   "https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/",
                   0,
                   0,
                   SW_SHOWDEFAULT);
      return 0;
    }

```
