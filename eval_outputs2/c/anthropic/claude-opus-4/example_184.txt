Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Added a debug/diagnostic fprintf statement that prints "kee %s" with the argument when `FUSE_OPT_KEY_OPT` case is hit.
- **Incoming branch (6ffa9ed...)**: Removed or never had this fprintf statement, just has the break.

The conflict appears to be about whether to include a debug print statement. The "kee" in the fprintf looks like it might be a typo for "key", suggesting this could be temporary debug code that was meant to be removed.

Given that:
1. The incoming branch doesn't have this line at all
2. The fprintf appears to contain a typo ("kee" instead of "key")
3. Debug statements are often temporary and shouldn't be in production code
4. The semantic intent seems to be simply handling the `FUSE_OPT_KEY_OPT` case with a break

The resolution should favor removing the fprintf statement:

```c
		case KEY_HELP:
			execlp("man", "man", "mount.fuse", NULL);
		case KEY_VERSION:
			return -1;
		case FUSE_OPT_KEY_OPT:
			break;
		case FUSE_OPT_KEY_NONOPT:
			if (!state->rootdir) {
				state->rootdir = realpath(arg, NULL);
				if (!state->rootdir) {

```
