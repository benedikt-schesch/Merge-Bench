Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's about choosing the public exponent value for RSA key generation. The conflict is between:
- HEAD: using `0xFFFF` (65535)
- The other branch: using `0x10001` (65537)

In RSA cryptography, `0x10001` (65537) is the standard and recommended public exponent value. It's widely used because it provides good security properties and efficient encryption operations. The value `0xFFFF` (65535) is non-standard and not recommended for RSA key generation.

Based on cryptographic best practices, the semantically correct resolution would be to use `0x10001`. Here's the resolved code:

```c
	FILE *f;
	char *name = NULL;
	char *filename;

	fprintf(stderr, _("Generating %d bits keys:\n"), bits);
	rsa_key = RSA_generate_key(bits, 0x10001, indicator, NULL);

	if(!rsa_key) {
		fprintf(stderr, _("Error during key generation!\n"));
		return false;
	} else

```
