Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to document Catmull-Rom curves, but they have two differences:

1. Spelling: "Catmul Rom" vs "Catmull-Rom" (the second is the correct spelling)
2. The tangent formula at t=0: "(p2-p0)/2" vs "(p2-p0)/3"

The correct properties of a Catmull-Rom spline are:
- At t=0, the curve goes through p1 with tangent (p2-p0)/2
- At t=1, the curve goes through p2 with tangent (p3-p1)/2

So the HEAD version has the correct tangent formula, while the other branch has the correct spelling. Here's the resolved version:

```c
#include "bezier_curve.h"
#include "../common/scene_curves.h"

/*

  Implements Catmull-Rom curves with control points p0, p1, p2, p3. At
  t=0 the curve goes through p1, with tangent (p2-p0)/2, and for t=1
  the curve goes through p2 with tangent (p3-p2)/2.
