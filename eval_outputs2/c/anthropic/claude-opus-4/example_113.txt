Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD wants to return 1 after `share_begin_cleanup(cs);`
- The other branch (4348393f) wants to remove the return statement entirely

Without more context about what this function should return or what the calling code expects, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The semantic intent is ambiguous - it's unclear whether:
1. The function should return a value (and if so, what value and why)
2. The function should continue execution after the cleanup
3. The return type of the containing function

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
    else
#endif
      ssh_sharing_logf(cs->parent->ssh, cs->id, "Socket error: %s", error_msg);
  }
  share_begin_cleanup(cs);
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return 1;
