Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a conflict in the version control metadata (specifically the $Id$ tag that contains version information). Both sides are trying to update the version information, but with different values.

The HEAD version shows:
- Version 1.13
- Date: 2003/08/24 20:38:24
- Author: guus

The incoming version shows:
- Version 1.9.4.73
- Date: 2003/12/20 19:47:52
- Author: guus

Since the incoming version has a more recent date (December 2003 vs August 2003) and appears to be from a different branch (given the 1.9.4.73 version number format), the semantic intent is to keep the most recent version information.

Here's the resolved code:
