Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the branch `4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5` is trying to add a conditional compilation directive `#ifndef COVERITY` before the network byte order conversion functions (ntohl, htonl, htons, ntohs).

The intent appears to be excluding these specific Windows socket functions from being loaded when running under Coverity (a static analysis tool). This is likely because Coverity may have its own implementations or handling of these functions that could conflict with dynamically loading them.

Since HEAD doesn't have this conditional compilation, and the other branch is adding it for a specific purpose (Coverity compatibility), the semantic intent is to conditionally exclude these functions only when building with Coverity.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```c
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, WSAGetLastError);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, WSAEnumNetworkEvents);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, WSAStartup);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, WSACleanup);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, closesocket);
#ifndef COVERITY
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, ntohl);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, htonl);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, htons);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, ntohs);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, gethostname);
#endif
```

Note: I'm assuming the `#ifndef COVERITY` should also include `gethostname` since it appears to be part of the same group of functions being conditionally compiled. If this assumption is incorrect, the `#endif` should be placed before the `gethostname` line instead.
