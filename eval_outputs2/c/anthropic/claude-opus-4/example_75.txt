Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to fix a typo in the comment. The only difference is:

- HEAD: uses "supress" (incorrect spelling)
- The other branch: uses "suppress" (correct spelling)

The intent is clear - the comment should use the correct spelling of "suppress". Here's the resolved code:

```c

void request_resize(void *frontend, int w, int h)
{
  int width, height;

  /* If the window is maximized suppress resizing attempts */
  if (IsZoomed(hwnd)) {
    if (conf_get_int(conf, CONF_resize_action) == RESIZE_TERM)
      return;
  }


```
