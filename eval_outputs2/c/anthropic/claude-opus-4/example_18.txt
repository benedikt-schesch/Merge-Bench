Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch) has added a new option `{ "unbuffered", no_argument, NULL, 'u' },`
- The other branch (05f934d5...) doesn't have this option

This appears to be a case where one branch added a new command-line option while the other branch didn't. Since this is an additive change that doesn't conflict with the existing options, and the "unbuffered" option seems like a legitimate feature addition, the resolution should include this option.

```c
        { "id", required_argument, NULL, 'i' },
        { "bundle", required_argument, NULL, 'b' },
        { "args", required_argument, NULL, 'a' },
        { "verbose", no_argument, NULL, 'v' },
        { "timeout", required_argument, NULL, 't' },
        { "unbuffered", no_argument, NULL, 'u' },
        { "xcode", required_argument, NULL, 'x' },
        { NULL, 0, NULL, 0 },
    };
    char ch;
