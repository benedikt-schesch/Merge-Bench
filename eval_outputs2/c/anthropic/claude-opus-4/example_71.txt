Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call a function to clear an arrow, with the only difference being the function name:
- HEAD uses `DrawInsert`
- The other branch uses `p_DrawInsert`

Without more context about the codebase, it's difficult to determine which is correct. The `p_` prefix might indicate a pointer to a function, a private function, or a platform-specific implementation. Since the intent of both sides is identical (clearing the arrow by calling a DrawInsert function with the same parameters), but I cannot determine which function name is correct without additional context, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
        /* XXX hack Q183115 */
        SetWindowLongPtr(hwnd, DWLP_MSGRESULT, TRUE);
        ret |= 1;
        break;
      case DL_CANCELDRAG:
<<<<<<< HEAD
        DrawInsert(hwnd, dlm->hWnd, -1); /* Clear arrow */
=======
        p_DrawInsert(hwnd, dlm->hWnd, -1); /* Clear arrow */
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
        SendDlgItemMessage(
            hwnd, hdl->listid, LB_DELETESTRING, hdl->dummyitem, 0);
        hdl->dragging = 0;
        ret |= 1;
        break;

```
