Looking at this merge conflict, I can see there's a disagreement about what value to pass as the second argument to `handle_unthrottle()`.

- HEAD wants to pass `new_backlog`
- The other branch wants to pass `0`

Without more context about the intent of both changes and what `handle_unthrottle()` expects, I cannot determine which is semantically correct. The conflict appears to be a substantive difference in behavior rather than a simple formatting issue.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
  } else {
    /*
     * Otherwise, we've successfully thawed!
     */
    ps->frozen = UNFROZEN;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    handle_unthrottle(ps->recv_h, new_backlog);
=======
    handle_unthrottle(ps->recv_h, 0);
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
  }
}

static void sk_handle_set_frozen(Socket s, int is_frozen)
{

```
