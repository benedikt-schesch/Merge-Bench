Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are working with the same memory allocation check for `qhead`. The conflict appears to be about whether to initialize `qhead->prefixlen = 0` after the allocation.

Since this appears to be initialization code after allocating memory for `qhead`, and one side wants to explicitly set `prefixlen` to 0, this is likely an important initialization step that should be included. The semantic intent seems to be proper initialization of the structure.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
  if (!qhead) {
    fprintf(stderr, "out of memory\n");
    exit(1);
  }
  qhead->prefixlen = 0;
  for (e = environ; *e; e++)
    qhead->first_node = new_node(qhead->first_node, *e, strcspn(*e, "="));

  qtail = qhead;
  while (1) {

```
