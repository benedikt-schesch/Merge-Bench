Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are working with GTK 3.0+ code for color conversion. The conflict appears to be about whether to include a comment explaining the deprecation of `gdk_window_set_background`.

The HEAD branch adds a comment explaining why this workaround is needed, while the other branch (fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5) has the same functional code but without the explanatory comment.

Since both sides have the same intent (converting GdkColor to CSS using GdkRGBA for GTK 3.0+) and the comment provides valuable context about why this approach is being used, I'll resolve this by keeping the comment from HEAD:

```c
}

#if GTK_CHECK_VERSION(3, 0, 0)
char *colour_to_css(const GdkColor *col)
{
  /* gdk_window_set_background is deprecated; work around its
   * absence. */
  GdkRGBA rgba;
  rgba.red = col->red / 65535.0;
  rgba.green = col->green / 65535.0;
  rgba.blue = col->blue / 65535.0;
  rgba.alpha = 1.0;

```
