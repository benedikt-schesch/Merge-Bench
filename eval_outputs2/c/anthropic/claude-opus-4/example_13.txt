Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - destroying elements from index `new_active` to `size_active`. The difference is in the approach:

- HEAD uses the standard C++ allocator-aware destruction method: `std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy(alloc, &items[i])`
- The other branch uses direct destructor calls: `items[i].~T()`

The HEAD version is more correct and follows modern C++ best practices because:
1. It properly handles custom allocators that might have specialized destroy behavior
2. It's consistent with how the allocator is likely used elsewhere in the code (given the presence of an `alloc` variable)
3. It's the standard-compliant way to destroy objects managed by allocators

Here's the resolved code:

```c
        assert(new_active <= new_alloced); 

        /* destroy elements */
        if (new_active < size_active) 
        {
          for (size_t i=new_active; i<size_active; i++)
            std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy(alloc, &items[i]);
          size_active = new_active;
        }

        /* only reallocate if necessary */
        if (new_alloced == size_alloced) {

```
