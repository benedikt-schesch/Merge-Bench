Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to improve the error message formatting when a connection fails. 

The HEAD version:
- Uses `conf_get_str(inst->conf, CONF_host)` to get the host
- Has the string on a single line

The incoming change (4348393f):
- Uses `conf_dest(inst->conf)` to get the destination
- Splits the `dupprintf` call across multiple lines for better formatting

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both want to display an error message about connection failure
2. The incoming change seems to be using a more appropriate function (`conf_dest` instead of `conf_get_str`) which likely provides a better representation of the connection destination
3. The incoming change also improves code formatting

The resolution should use `conf_dest(inst->conf)` as it appears to be the more semantically correct function for getting the connection destination, while keeping the improved formatting:

```c
                           &realhost,
                           conf_get_int(inst->conf, CONF_tcp_nodelay),
                           conf_get_int(inst->conf, CONF_tcp_keepalives));

  if (error) {
    char *msg = dupprintf(
        "Unable to open connection to %s:\n%s", conf_dest(inst->conf), error);
    inst->exited = TRUE;
    fatal_message_box(inst->window, msg);
    sfree(msg);
    exit(0);
  }

```
