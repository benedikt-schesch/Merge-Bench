Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- The HEAD version checks two conditions: `connopen && back->connected(backhandle)`
- The incoming change only checks: `back->connected(backhandle)`

The conflict appears to be about whether to include the `connopen` check. The HEAD version seems more defensive by checking if the connection is open before checking if it's connected. Without more context about what `connopen` represents and when it's set/unset, I cannot determine which approach is semantically correct.

Since the intent is ambiguous without understanding the broader codebase and the purpose of the `connopen` variable, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
      buf[strlen(buf) - 1] = '\0';
    fprintf(stderr, "Unable to read from standard input: %s\n", buf);
    cleanup_exit(0);
  }
  noise_ultralight(len);

  if (back->connected(backhandle)) {
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
    if (len > 0) {
      return back->send(backhandle, data, len);
    } else {
      back->special(backhandle, TS_EOF);
      return 0;
```
