Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch) includes: `qhead->prefixlen = 0;` - This initializes the prefixlen field of the newly allocated bucket structure
- The incoming change (commit 4348393f5...) removes this line entirely

Since the context shows memory allocation for a bucket structure and error handling, and the HEAD version includes initialization of a field, the semantic intent appears to be proper initialization of the allocated structure. The removal in the incoming change might be intentional (perhaps prefixlen is initialized elsewhere or no longer needed) or could be an oversight.

Without more context about the bucket structure definition and how prefixlen is used elsewhere, I cannot determine with certainty whether this field initialization should be kept or removed.

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```c
  struct bucket *qhead, *qtail;
  extern char **environ;
  char **e;

  qhead = (struct bucket *)malloc(sizeof(struct bucket));
<<<<<<< HEAD
  qhead->prefixlen = 0;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
  if (!qhead) {
    fprintf(stderr, "out of memory\n");
    exit(1);
  }
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
