Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD version: Assigns the return value of `plug_receive()` to `new_backlog`
- Other version: Simply calls `plug_receive()` without capturing its return value

The key question is whether the return value of `plug_receive()` is needed. Looking at the context, I don't see `new_backlog` being used after this point in the visible code. However, without seeing more context, I cannot definitively determine if `new_backlog` is used later or if the return value should be ignored.

Since the intent is ambiguous without more context, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
  /*
   * Hand it off to the plug. Be careful of re-entrance - that might
   * have the effect of trying to close this socket.
   */
  ps->defer_close = TRUE;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  new_backlog = plug_receive(ps->plug, 0, data, len);
=======
  plug_receive(ps->plug, 0, data, len);
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
  bufchain_consume(&ps->inputdata, len);
  ps->defer_close = FALSE;
  if (ps->deferred_close) {
    sk_handle_close(ps);
    return;
```
