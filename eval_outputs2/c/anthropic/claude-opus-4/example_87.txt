Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call a printer write function, but they're using different function names:

- HEAD uses: `WritePrinter`
- The incoming change uses: `p_WritePrinter` 

From the context, it appears that `p_WritePrinter` is likely a function pointer or a wrapper function (indicated by the `p_` prefix), while `WritePrinter` might be the direct Windows API call.

Without more context about the codebase's architecture and whether there's a reason for using the pointer/wrapper version versus the direct call, I cannot determine which approach is correct. The intent is ambiguous.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
  DWORD written;

  if (!pj)
    return;

<<<<<<< HEAD
  WritePrinter(pj->hprinter, data, len, &written);
=======
  p_WritePrinter(pj->hprinter, data, len, &written);
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
}

void printer_finish_job(printer_job *pj)
{
  if (!pj)

```
