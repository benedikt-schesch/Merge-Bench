Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD wants to return 1 at the end of this function
- The other branch (4348393f5...) wants the function to end without a return statement

Without seeing the function signature and more context, it's difficult to determine with certainty which is correct. However, given that:
1. This appears to be the end of a function (closing brace follows)
2. The next function `x11_receive` begins immediately after
3. The HEAD branch explicitly adds a return value

The most likely scenario is that HEAD is fixing a missing return statement in a function that should return an int. Since I cannot determine the exact intent without more context (like the function signature), I'll preserve the conflict as-is:

```c
     * channel.
     */
    if (xconn->c)
      sshfwd_write_eof(xconn->c);
  }
<<<<<<< HEAD

  return 1;

static void x11_receive(Plug plug, int urgent, char *data, int len)
{
  struct X11Connection *xconn = (struct X11Connection *)plug;

```
