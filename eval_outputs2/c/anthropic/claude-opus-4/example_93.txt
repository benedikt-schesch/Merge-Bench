Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to fix what appears to be a variable name issue. The conflict is about whether to use `type` or `event->type` in the switch statement.

Based on the context and common patterns in event handling code (this appears to be GTK/GDK event handling), the correct resolution would likely be `event->type` since we're checking the type field of an event structure. However, without seeing more context about where the `type` variable comes from or whether `event` is available in this scope, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict.

Here is the same snippet with the conflict markers preserved:

```c
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
    button = MBT_WHEEL_DOWN;
  else
    return FALSE; /* don't even know what button! */

<<<<<<< HEAD
  switch (type) {
=======
  switch (event->type) {
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
  case GDK_BUTTON_PRESS:
    act = MA_CLICK;
    break;
  case GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE:
    act = MA_RELEASE;

```
