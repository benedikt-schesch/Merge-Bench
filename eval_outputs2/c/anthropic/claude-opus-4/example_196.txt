Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- The HEAD branch is adding a new function declaration `mraa_setup_uart` with its documentation
- The other branch (d7c8f2a79431b8f9461597b86ef9f046357404c6) is adding C++ compatibility closing braces

Both changes are semantically compatible and serve different purposes. The HEAD branch is extending the API with a new UART setup function, while the other branch is ensuring C++ compatibility by closing what appears to be an `extern "C"` block.

The resolution should include both changes:

```c
 * @param pin physical pin to operate on
 * @return out direction to setup. 1 for output 0 for input
 */
mraa_result_t mraa_swap_complex_gpio(int pin, int out);

/** Setup uart muxes to exposes the pins physically.
 *
 * @param index of the uart in the board definition to expose physically
 * @return mraa_result_t of operation
 */
mraa_result_t mraa_setup_uart(int index);
