Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the semantic intent of both sides:

- The HEAD side (current branch) adds a return statement: `return !finished;`
- The incoming change (commit 4348393f5...) removes that return statement, leaving the function to end after the closing brace

Without more context about the function signature and its expected behavior, it's ambiguous whether this function should return a value or be void. The conflict represents a fundamental disagreement about the function's return behavior.

Since the intent is ambiguous and I cannot determine which behavior is correct without more context, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c

    serial->finished = TRUE;

    notify_remote_exit(serial->frontend);
  }
<<<<<<< HEAD

  return !finished;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

static void serial_uxsel_setup(Serial serial)
{
  int rwx = 0;

```
