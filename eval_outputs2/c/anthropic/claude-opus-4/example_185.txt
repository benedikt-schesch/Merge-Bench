Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) removes a `break;` statement while the other side (6ffa9ed1f1) keeps it. 

Based on the context, this appears to be inside a switch statement or similar control structure. The code before the conflict shows a return statement (`return 0;`), which means the `break;` statement would be unreachable code if kept.

The semantic intent seems clear: HEAD recognized that the `break;` is unnecessary after a `return` statement and removed it, while the other branch may have added or kept it without realizing it's unreachable.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
					return -1;
				}
				state->rootdir_len = state->rootdir ? strlen(state->rootdir) : -1;
				return 0;
			}
	}

	return 1;
}
