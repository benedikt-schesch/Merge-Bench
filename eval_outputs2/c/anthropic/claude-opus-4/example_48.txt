Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version control conflict in the header comment of a file (`tincd.c`). Both sides are trying to update the `$Id$` line which appears to be an RCS/CVS version control tag.

The conflict shows:
- HEAD has version 1.17 from 2003/08/24
- The incoming change has version 1.10.4.90 from 2003/12/07

Based on the dates and version numbers, the incoming change (1.10.4.90 from December 2003) appears to be from a later date than HEAD (1.17 from August 2003), despite having a lower major version number. This suggests these might be from different branches.

Since both sides are just updating version control metadata and the actual semantic intent is the same (tracking the file version), the best resolution would be to keep the more recent timestamp. Here's the resolved version:
