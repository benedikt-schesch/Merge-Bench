Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- The HEAD branch (current branch) wants to return 0 after executing the callback and canceling the query
- The incoming branch (4348393f5...) wants to end the function without an explicit return statement

From the context, this appears to be the end of a function that processes some kind of agent connection callback. The function executes a callback, cancels the query, and then needs to complete.

Without seeing the full function signature and return type, it's difficult to determine definitively whether this function should return a value or is void. Since I cannot be certain of the intent, I'll preserve the conflict as requested:

```c
   * clean up. (Of course we don't free retbuf, since ownership
   * of that passes to the callback.)
   */
  conn->callback(conn->callback_ctx, conn->retbuf, conn->retlen);
  agent_cancel_query(conn);
