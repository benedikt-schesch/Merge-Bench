Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to declare two variables (`len` and `new_backlog`), while the other branch only declares `len`. 

Based on the context and the function name `handle_socket_unfreeze`, it appears that the HEAD branch is likely adding functionality related to handling a new backlog value during the socket unfreezing process. Since the `new_backlog` variable is being added intentionally in HEAD and doesn't conflict with the other branch's intent (which only needed `len`), the semantic resolution would be to keep both variables.

Here's the resolved code:

```c

static void handle_socket_unfreeze(void *psv)
{
  Handle_Socket ps = (Handle_Socket)psv;
  void *data;
  int len, new_backlog;

  /*
   * If we've been put into a state other than THAWING since the
   * last callback, then we're done.
   */

```
