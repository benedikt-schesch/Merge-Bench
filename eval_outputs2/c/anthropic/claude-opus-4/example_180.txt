Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

**HEAD (left side):**
- Returns the result of `ps->negotiate(ps, PROXY_CHANGE_RECEIVE)`
- Then returns the result of `plug_receive(ps->plug, urgent, data, len)`

**Incoming change (right side):**
- Calls `ps->negotiate(ps, PROXY_CHANGE_RECEIVE)` without using its return value
- Then calls `plug_receive(ps->plug, urgent, data, len)` without using its return value

The key insight is that the HEAD version is trying to return values from these function calls, while the incoming change treats them as void operations. Given that this appears to be inside a conditional block (based on the closing brace before `return`/`} else {`), and considering this is likely a callback or event handler function, the semantic intent seems to be:

1. First negotiate the proxy change
2. Then forward the data to the plug

Since the HEAD version has two return statements in sequence (which would make the second unreachable), this appears to be a logical error. The incoming change's approach of calling both functions without returning makes more semantic sense for a proxy that needs to both negotiate and forward data.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
     */
    bufchain_add(&ps->pending_input_data, data, len);
    ps->receive_urgent = urgent;
    ps->receive_data = data;
    ps->receive_len = len;
    ps->negotiate(ps, PROXY_CHANGE_RECEIVE);
  } else {
    plug_receive(ps->plug, urgent, data, len);
  }
}

static void plug_proxy_sent(Plug p, int bufsize)
{
  Proxy_Plug pp = (Proxy_Plug)p;

```
