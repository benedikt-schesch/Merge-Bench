Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD wants to `return 1;` after closing the connection
- The other branch wants to `return;` (void return) after closing the connection

The conflict is about the return type. Looking at the context, this appears to be inside a function that handles SOCKS protocol errors. After sending a "request rejected" message and closing the connection, the function needs to return.

Without seeing the full function signature, I cannot definitively resolve whether this function should return an int (1) or void. The semantic intent is unclear because both sides want to exit the function after the error handling, but they disagree on what to return.

Since I cannot determine the correct return type from the given context, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
          char data[8];
          memset(data, 0, sizeof(data));
          data[1] = 91; /* generic `request rejected' */
          sk_write(pf->s, data, 8);
          pfd_close(pf);
<<<<<<< HEAD
          return 1;
=======
          return;
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
        }
        if (pf->sockslen <= 8)
          continue; /* haven't started user/hostname */
        if (pf->socksbuf[pf->sockslen - 1] != 0)
          continue; /* haven't _finished_ user/hostname */

```
