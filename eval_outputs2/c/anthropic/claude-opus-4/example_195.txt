Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one branch (HEAD) has no additional code after the `platform_type` declaration, while the other branch adds a new variable `mraa_adv_func advance_func;`.

Since this appears to be adding a new feature (advanced functions) and doesn't conflict with the existing code semantically, the resolution should include both the existing code and the new addition.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
#include "version.h"

//static mraa_pininfo_t* pindata;
static mraa_board_t* plat = NULL;
static mraa_platform_t platform_type = MRAA_UNKNOWN_PLATFORM;
mraa_adv_func advance_func;

const char *
mraa_get_version()
{
    return gVERSION;

```
