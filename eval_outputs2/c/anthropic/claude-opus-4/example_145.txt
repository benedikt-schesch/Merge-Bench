Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add Windows function loading calls, but they're adding different functions. The HEAD version doesn't add anything beyond FlashWindowEx, while the incoming change adds ToUnicodeEx.

Since both functions appear to serve different purposes and there's no semantic conflict between them (they're just loading different Windows API functions), the resolution should include both function calls.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
static void init_winfuncs(void)
{
  HMODULE user32_module = load_system32_dll("user32.dll");
  HMODULE winmm_module = load_system32_dll("winmm.dll");
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(user32_module, FlashWindowEx);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(user32_module, ToUnicodeEx);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION_PP(winmm_module, PlaySound);
}
