Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to fix a typo in the comment for `SL`. The only difference is:
- HEAD version: `doesnt`
- Incoming version: `doesn't`

The incoming version with `doesn't` is the correct spelling (with the apostrophe), so I'll resolve the conflict by choosing that version.

```c
};

/* Shaping Types */
enum
{
  SL, /* Left-Joining, doesn't exist in U+0600 - U+06FF */
  SR, /* Right-Joining, ie has Isolated, Final */
  SD, /* Dual-Joining, ie has Isolated, Final, Initial, Medial */
  SU, /* Non-Joining */
  SC  /* Join-Causing, like U+0640 (TATWEEL) */
};

```
