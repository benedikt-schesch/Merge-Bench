Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to call a function to initialize common controls, but they're using different naming conventions:

- HEAD uses: `InitCommonControls();` (PascalCase)
- The other branch uses: `init_common_controls();` (snake_case)

Since this appears to be a simple naming convention difference rather than a semantic difference (both are trying to initialize common controls), I cannot definitively determine which naming convention should be used without more context about the codebase's style guidelines.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
  char **argv;
  int ret;

  dll_hijacking_protection();

<<<<<<< HEAD
  InitCommonControls();
=======
  init_common_controls();
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
  hinst = inst;
  hwnd = NULL;
