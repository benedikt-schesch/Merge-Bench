Looking at this merge conflict, both sides appear to have identical content - they both declare `zend_property_info* parent_info = NULL;`. The only difference is that the second version (after the `=======` marker) has a trailing space after the semicolon.

Since both sides have the same semantic intent (declaring and initializing the same variable), I'll resolve this by keeping one version without the trailing space:

```c
*/
static int store_property_access_check(Bucket * p, zend_class_entry * from)
{
    zend_class_entry *parent = from->parent;
    zend_property_info* child_info = (zend_property_info*)p->pData;
    zend_property_info* parent_info = NULL;

#ifdef ZEND_ENGINE_2_2
    return (child_info->ce != from);
#endif


```
