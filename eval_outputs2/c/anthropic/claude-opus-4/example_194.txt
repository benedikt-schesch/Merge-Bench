Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the conflict is about whether to include a pre-write hook functionality. The HEAD version doesn't have this feature, while the incoming change adds a check for `advance_func.gpio_write_pre` before proceeding with the write operation.

Based on the semantic intent, the incoming change appears to be adding a valuable feature - a pre-write callback that allows for additional validation or preprocessing before actually writing to the GPIO. This is a common pattern in hardware abstraction layers.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
mraa_gpio_write(mraa_gpio_context dev, int value)
{
    if (dev->mmap == 1)
        return mraa_gpio_write_register(dev,value);

    if (advance_func.gpio_write_pre != NULL) {
        mraa_result_t pre_ret = (advance_func.gpio_write_pre(dev,value));
        if(pre_ret != MRAA_SUCCESS)
            return pre_ret;
    }

    if (dev->value_fp == -1) {
        mraa_gpio_get_valfp(dev);
    }
    if (lseek(dev->value_fp, 0, SEEK_SET) == -1) {
        return MRAA_ERROR_INVALID_RESOURCE;

```
