Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD has: DB_VERSION 15, PARSER_VERSION 9
- The incoming branch has: DB_VERSION 16, PARSER_VERSION 8

This appears to be a version number conflict where:
- The DB_VERSION was incremented from 15 to 16 in the incoming branch
- The PARSER_VERSION was incremented from 8 to 9 in HEAD

Without additional context about what these versions represent or which changes are more recent/important, I cannot determine the correct resolution. The conflict appears to represent parallel development where both the database schema and parser were modified independently.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
#include <errno.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include "sqlite3/sqlite3.h"

<<<<<<< HEAD
#define DB_VERSION 15
#define PARSER_VERSION 9
=======
#define DB_VERSION 16
#define PARSER_VERSION 8
>>>>>>> 72bfaf80b3ff531c0bf994fbbacbdbf29e5d21ca

enum {
	DB_BEGIN,
	DB_COMMIT,
	DB_ROLLBACK,
