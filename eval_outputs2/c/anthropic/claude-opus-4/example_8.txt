Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

**HEAD (current branch)**: After failing to acquire the lock with the fast approach, it simply calls `mm_do_lock_slow(&lock->locked)` and continues.

**Incoming change**: After failing to acquire the lock, it unlocks the spinlock, yields the scheduler to give other threads a chance to run, and then presumably retries.

The conflict appears to be about different strategies for handling lock acquisition failure:
- HEAD wants to immediately fall back to a slow locking mechanism
- The incoming change wants to release the lock, yield, and retry

Without more context about the overall locking strategy and whether this is inside a loop or what the broader design intent is, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The two approaches are fundamentally different and choosing between them requires understanding the intended locking behavior.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c

        if (ret) {
            /* Still no luck, try the slow approach */
            mm_do_lock_slow(&lock->locked);
        }
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
        _spinlock_unlock(lock);
        sched_yield();
>>>>>>> 5921a191ef461e97a894063110b45f415affddcb
    }
    return 1;
}

static void mm_do_lock_slow(volatile unsigned int* locked)
