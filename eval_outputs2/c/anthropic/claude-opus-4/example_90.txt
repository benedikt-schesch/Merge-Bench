Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to create a Cairo image surface, but they disagree on the pixel format:

- HEAD wants to use `CAIRO_FORMAT_RGB24` (no alpha channel)
- The incoming change wants to use `CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32` (with alpha channel)

Without more context about the application's requirements for transparency/alpha channel support, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The choice between RGB24 and ARGB32 depends on whether the surface needs to support transparency.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
      cairo_surface_destroy(inst->surface);
      inst->surface = NULL;
    }

    inst->surface =
<<<<<<< HEAD
        cairo_image_surface_create(CAIRO_FORMAT_RGB24, backing_w, backing_h);
=======
        cairo_image_surface_create(CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32, backing_w, backing_h);
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
#endif
  }

  draw_backing_rect(inst);
