Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch added a `char buf[4096];` declaration, while the other branch (4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5) removed or didn't include this line.

Without more context about how `buf` is used later in the function, I cannot determine the correct resolution. The buffer might be needed for subsequent operations in the HEAD branch, or it might have been removed in the other branch because it's no longer needed.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
                      (HANDLE, LPVOID, DWORD, LPDWORD));

static void init_winfuncs(void)
{
  static int initialised = FALSE;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  char buf[4096];
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
  if (initialised)
    return;
  {
    HMODULE winspool_module = load_system32_dll("winspool.drv");
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
