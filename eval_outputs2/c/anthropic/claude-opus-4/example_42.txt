Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version control system (VCS) conflict in what appears to be a header comment section of a C file. The conflict is specifically about the `$Id:` line which contains version control metadata.

Both sides of the merge are trying to update the version information:
- HEAD has version 1.6 with timestamp 2003/08/24 20:38:25
- The other branch has version 1.2.4.19 with timestamp 2003/08/22 11:18:42

Since the HEAD version (1.6) appears to be newer based on the date (08/24 vs 08/22) and has a simpler version number suggesting it's from the main development line, the semantic intent would be to keep the more recent version.

Here's the resolved snippet:
