Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that HEAD wants to add `connopen = 1;` after the code block that handles the backend connection setup, while the other branch (4348393f) wants to keep that line removed.

Given the context, it appears that `connopen` is likely a flag indicating that a connection has been successfully opened. The placement right after the backend setup and before the standard handle initialization suggests this is the appropriate location to set this flag.

Since HEAD is trying to add meaningful state tracking (setting a connection flag after establishing the backend), while the other branch simply removes it without replacement, I'll resolve in favor of HEAD's version:

```c
      return 1;
    }
    back->provide_logctx(backhandle, logctx);
    sfree(realhost);
  }
  connopen = 1;

  inhandle = GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE);
  outhandle = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
  errhandle = GetStdHandle(STD_ERROR_HANDLE);


```
