Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Has a clean function start with just the parameter validation
- **Incoming branch (d7c8f2a79...)**: Adds a pre-initialization hook that checks if `advance_func.gpio_init_pre` exists and calls it before proceeding with the rest of the initialization

The semantic intent of the incoming change is to add a pre-initialization callback mechanism that allows custom initialization logic to run before the standard GPIO initialization. This is a common pattern for extensibility.

The resolution should include the pre-initialization hook from the incoming branch since it adds functionality without conflicting with the existing logic. The hook properly returns NULL on failure, maintaining the same error handling pattern as the rest of the function.

```c
}

mraa_gpio_context
mraa_gpio_init_raw(int pin)
{
    if (advance_func.gpio_init_pre != NULL) {
        printf("Actually entering\n");
        if (advance_func.gpio_init_pre(pin) != MRAA_SUCCESS)
            return NULL;
    }
    if (pin < 0)
        return NULL;

    char bu[MAX_SIZE];
    int length;

```
