Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (the branch being merged in) is trying to add a declaration for variable `j` that's used in the `sscanf` call below, while HEAD doesn't have this declaration.

The intent is clear: the variable `j` needs to be declared before it can be used in the `sscanf` call. The branch being merged in is fixing what appears to be a missing variable declaration.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
          errmsg = "unsupported cipher";
          goto error;
        }
        p = strchr(p, ',') + 1; /* always non-NULL, by above checks */
        for (i = 0; i < ivlen; i++) {
          unsigned j;
          if (1 != sscanf(p, "%2x", &j)) {
            errmsg = "expected more iv data in DEK-Info";
            goto error;
          }
          ret->iv[i] = j;
```
