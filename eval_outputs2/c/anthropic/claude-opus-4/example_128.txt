Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the semantic intent of both sides:

**HEAD version**: `return plug_receive(s->plug, 2, buf, ret);`
- Returns the value from `plug_receive()`
- This suggests the calling function expects a return value

**Other branch version**: `plug_receive(s->plug, 2, buf, ret);`
- Simply calls `plug_receive()` without returning its value
- Ends with a break statement, suggesting this is inside a switch/case

Given that this appears to be inside a switch statement (indicated by the `break;` after the conflict), and one side wants to return while the other wants to continue to the break, the most semantically correct resolution would likely be to return the value, as returning would exit the function and make the break unnecessary.

However, without more context about the function's return type and whether other cases in the switch statement also return values, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
         */
        if (s->addr) {
          sk_addr_free(s->addr);
          s->addr = NULL;
        }

      }
      break;
    }
