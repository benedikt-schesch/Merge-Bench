Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call a function to draw an insert marker, with the only difference being the function name:
- HEAD uses: `DrawInsert`
- The incoming change uses: `p_DrawInsert`

Since the conflict is simply about which function name to use and both sides have the same intent (drawing an insert marker at the same location with the same parameters), I cannot determine which is correct without more context about the codebase's naming conventions or which function is the proper one to use.

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
      case DL_DRAGGING:
        hdl->dragging = 1;
        dest = pl_itemfrompt(dlm->hWnd, dlm->ptCursor, TRUE);
        if (dest > hdl->dummyitem)
          dest = hdl->dummyitem;
<<<<<<< HEAD
        DrawInsert(hwnd, dlm->hWnd, dest);
=======
        p_DrawInsert(hwnd, dlm->hWnd, dest);
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
        if (dest >= 0)
          SetWindowLongPtr(hwnd, DWLP_MSGRESULT, DL_MOVECURSOR);
        else
          SetWindowLongPtr(hwnd, DWLP_MSGRESULT, DL_STOPCURSOR);
        ret |= 1;

```
