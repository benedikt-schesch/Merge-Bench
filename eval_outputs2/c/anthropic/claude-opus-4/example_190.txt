Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the return value after clearing a bit in a register. 

The HEAD version simply returns `MRAA_SUCCESS` after the bit clear operation.

The incoming change adds a conditional check for a post-write callback function (`advance_func.gpio_mmaped_write_post`) and calls it if it exists, returning its result. If the callback doesn't exist, it falls through to return `MRAA_SUCCESS`.

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to return a success status after the bit manipulation
2. The incoming change wants to add support for an optional post-write callback that can be executed after the GPIO write operation

The resolution should include the callback functionality while preserving the success return behavior:

```c
        *((unsigned *)dev->reg) |= (1<<dev->reg_bit_pos);
        return MRAA_SUCCESS;
    }
    *((unsigned *)dev->reg) &= ~(1<<dev->reg_bit_pos);

    if (advance_func.gpio_mmaped_write_post != NULL)
        return advance_func.gpio_mmaped_write_post(dev,value);
    return MRAA_SUCCESS;
}

static mraa_result_t
mraa_gpio_wait_interrupt(int fd)

```
