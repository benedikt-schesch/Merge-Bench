Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version control conflict in what appears to be a header comment section of a C source file. The conflict is between two different version identifiers (`$Id$` tags) that were likely automatically generated by a version control system (probably CVS based on the format).

Both sides are trying to document the file version, but they have different version numbers and timestamps:
- HEAD has version 1.32 from 2003/08/24
- The other branch has version 1.28.4.148 from 2003/11/17

Since the second version has a later date (November vs August) and appears to be from a more developed branch (based on the version numbering scheme 1.28.4.148), the semantic intent would typically be to keep the more recent version information.

Here's the resolved code:
