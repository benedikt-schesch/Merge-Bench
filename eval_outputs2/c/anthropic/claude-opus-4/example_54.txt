Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD**: Simply calls `elf_end(elf->elf);` to free the ELF handle
- **Other branch**: Comments out the same call with `/* LEAK elf_end(elf->elf); */`, explicitly marking it as a leak

The context shows that after this line, `elf->elf` is reassigned to `elf->debug_data->elf`. This suggests that calling `elf_end(elf->elf)` before the reassignment would free the old ELF handle, preventing a memory leak.

The "LEAK" comment in the other branch appears to be acknowledging that commenting out this line creates a memory leak. This seems like a temporary debugging measure or a known issue that someone documented.

Since proper resource management would require freeing the old handle before reassignment, and the "LEAK" comment confirms this is indeed a leak when commented out, the semantically correct resolution is to keep the `elf_end(elf->elf);` call uncommented.

```c

  elf->symtab_data = elf->debug_data->symtab_data;
  elf->symtab_shdr = elf->debug_data->symtab_shdr;

  /* XXX free stuff */

  elf_end(elf->elf);
  elf->elf = elf->debug_data->elf;
  close(elf->debug_data->fd);

  dbg_printf("Finished dissecting debug data\n");
  return 0;

```
