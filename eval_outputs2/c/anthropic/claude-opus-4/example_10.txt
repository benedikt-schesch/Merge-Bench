Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of the `begin()` method in the context of a Catmull-Rom curve.

A Catmull-Rom curve is defined by 4 control points (v0, v1, v2, v3), where:
- v0 and v3 are used for calculating tangents
- v1 and v2 are the actual start and end points of the curve segment

Given that the `end()` method returns `v2`, and considering the typical implementation of Catmull-Rom curves, the `begin()` method should return `v1` (not `v0`) to maintain consistency. The curve segment is drawn between v1 and v2.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
      
      __forceinline CatmullRomCurveT(const Vertex& v0, const Vertex& v1, const Vertex& v2, const Vertex& v3)
        : v0(v0), v1(v1), v2(v2), v3(v3) {}

      __forceinline Vertex begin() const {
        return v1;
      }

      __forceinline Vertex end() const {
        return v2;
      }

```
