Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's about how to finish a coroutine. The conflict is between two different macro calls:
- HEAD wants: `crFinish(1);`
- The other branch wants: `crFinishV;`

Without more context about the coroutine system being used and what these specific macros do (whether `crFinish(1)` returns a value of 1, or if `crFinishV` is for void returns), I cannot determine the correct semantic intent. The choice between these two could significantly affect the behavior of the coroutine.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
    share_got_pkt_from_downstream(
        cs, cs->recvbuf[4], cs->recvbuf + 5, cs->recvlen - 5);
  }

}

static void share_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  /* struct ssh_sharing_connstate *cs = (struct ssh_sharing_connstate *)plug; */

```
