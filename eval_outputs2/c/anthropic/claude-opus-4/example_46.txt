Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a conflict in the version control ID line (`$Id$`) of a file header. Both sides are trying to update the version information, but with different values.

The HEAD version shows:
- Version 1.9
- Date: 2003/08/24 20:38:27
- Author: guus

The incoming change shows:
- Version 1.5.4.45 (appears to be from a different branch given the multi-part version number)
- Date: 2003/11/17 15:30:18 (which is more recent)
- Author: guus (same author)

Since this is just version control metadata and both changes are from the same author, the most reasonable resolution would be to keep the more recent timestamp. However, the version numbering suggests these might be from different branches (1.9 vs 1.5.4.45), which makes the intent ambiguous.

Since I cannot determine with certainty which version line should be kept without more context about the branching strategy and version numbering scheme being used, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unresolved:
