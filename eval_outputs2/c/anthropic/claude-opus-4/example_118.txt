Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): wants the function to return 1
- The other branch (4348393f5...): wants the function to end without an explicit return statement

This appears to be a function that handles some telnet data reception. The conflict is about whether this function should return a value or not.

Without seeing the function signature, it's difficult to determine the correct resolution. If the function is declared to return an int/value, then the `return 1;` is necessary. If it's a void function, then no return statement is needed.

Since I cannot determine the intent with certainty from the given context (the function signature is not visible), I'll return the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```c
  Telnet telnet = (Telnet)plug;
  if (urgent)
    telnet->in_synch = TRUE;
  telnet->session_started = TRUE;
  do_telnet_read(telnet, data, len);
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return 1;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

static void telnet_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  Telnet telnet = (Telnet)plug;

```
