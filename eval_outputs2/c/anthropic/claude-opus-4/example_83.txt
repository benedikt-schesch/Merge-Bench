Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to load the `gai_strerror` function, but they differ in:

1. **HEAD**: Uses `wship6_module` as the module source
2. **Incoming change**: Uses `winsock_module` as the module source and explicitly uses `GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION_NO_TYPECHECK`

The incoming change includes a comment "See comment above about type check" which suggests there's a specific reason for using the no-typecheck variant and the different module.

Without more context about which module is correct for `gai_strerror` or what the "comment above" refers to, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The semantic intent is clear (both want to load `gai_strerror`), but the implementation details differ in a way that could be significant.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
      logevent(NULL, "WSH IPv6 support detected");
#endif
      GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(wship6_module, getaddrinfo);
      GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(wship6_module, freeaddrinfo);
      GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(wship6_module, getnameinfo);
<<<<<<< HEAD
      GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(wship6_module, gai_strerror);
=======
      /* See comment above about type check */
      GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION_NO_TYPECHECK(winsock_module, gai_strerror);
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
    } else {
#ifdef NET_SETUP_DIAGNOSTICS
      logevent(NULL, "No IPv6 support detected");
#endif
    }

```
