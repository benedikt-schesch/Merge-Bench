Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same URL, with the only difference being the protocol:
- HEAD version uses: `http://`
- The other branch uses: `https://`

The intent appears to be the same - opening the PuTTY website. The conflict is simply about whether to use HTTP or HTTPS. In modern practice, HTTPS is preferred for security reasons, so the semantic resolution would be to use the HTTPS version.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
      return 0;
    case 102:
      /* Load web browser */
      ShellExecute(hwnd,
                   "open",
                   "https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/",
                   0,
                   0,
                   SW_SHOWDEFAULT);
      return 0;
    }

```
