Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to declare variables for token processing, but with slightly different approaches:

- HEAD side: Declares `tokens` and `pair_array`
- Other side: Declares `string_tokens`, `tokens` (note: two separate token variables)

Both sides have the same final line declaring `pattern_pair_array` and `pair_array`.

Based on the semantic intent, it appears the other side wanted to distinguish between different types of tokens (hence `string_tokens` and `tokens`), while HEAD kept it simpler. Since both sides need `pair_array` and the other side seems to have a more specific intent with the two token variables, I'll resolve by keeping both token variables from the other side:

```c
 */

static VALUE PairDistance_match(PairDistance *amatch, VALUE string, VALUE regexp, int use_regexp)
{
    double result;
    VALUE string_tokens, tokens;
    PairArray *pattern_pair_array, *pair_array;

    Check_Type(string, T_STRING);
    if (!NIL_P(regexp) || use_regexp) {
        tokens = rb_funcall(

```
