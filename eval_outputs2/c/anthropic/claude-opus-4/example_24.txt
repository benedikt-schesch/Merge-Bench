Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version control conflict in the file header comments, specifically in the CVS/RCS version identification line (`$Id$`).

Both sides are trying to track version information:
- HEAD shows version 1.14 with timestamp 2003/08/24 20:38:24
- The other branch shows version 1.9.4.77 with timestamp 2003/12/12 19:52:24

Since the second branch has a later timestamp and appears to be from a more advanced version (1.9.4.77 suggests a maintenance branch that has progressed further), the semantic intent would be to keep the more recent version information.

Here's the resolved code:
