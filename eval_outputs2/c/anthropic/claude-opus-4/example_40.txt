Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to define `AF_UNKNOWN` but with different values:
- HEAD uses `0xFFFF` (65535 in decimal, the maximum value for a 16-bit unsigned integer)
- The incoming branch uses `255` (0xFF in hex, the maximum value for an 8-bit unsigned integer)

Given that:
1. This appears to be defining an address family constant
2. The `sockaddr_unknown` structure below uses `uint16_t family` (16-bit field)
3. `0xFFFF` is a common sentinel value for "unknown" in 16-bit contexts
4. Standard address family constants (like AF_INET, AF_INET6) typically use small values

The HEAD version (`0xFFFF`) seems more semantically appropriate as it:
- Uses the maximum value possible for the 16-bit `family` field
- Is clearly distinguishable from valid address family values
- Is a common pattern for "invalid/unknown" markers

Here's the resolved snippet:

```c
	uint16_t x[8];
} ipv6_t;

typedef short length_t;

#define AF_UNKNOWN 0xFFFF

struct sockaddr_unknown {
	uint16_t family;
	uint16_t pad1;
	uint32_t pad2;

```
