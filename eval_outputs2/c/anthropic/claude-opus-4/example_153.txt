Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are declaring the variable `err`, but with different initialization approaches:

- HEAD declares `err` without initialization
- The other branch initializes `err` to 0

Since this appears to be an error code variable that will be used in the subsequent code (likely with the getaddrinfo call), initializing it to 0 is the safer and more defensive programming practice. This ensures the variable has a defined value before use.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
  ret->refcount = 1;
  *realhost = '\0';

  if ((a = p_inet_addr(host)) == (unsigned long)INADDR_NONE) {
    struct hostent *h = NULL;
    int err = 0;
#ifndef NO_IPV6
    /*
     * Use getaddrinfo when it's available
     */
    if (p_getaddrinfo) {

```
