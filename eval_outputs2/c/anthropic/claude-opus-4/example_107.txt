Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch) wants to return 1 from this function
- The incoming branch (4348393f5...) wants to remove the return statement entirely

Given the context, this appears to be a callback function handling received data. The function processes the data and sets a session flag. The key question is whether this function should return a value or not.

Looking at the pattern of the code and the fact that the next function `raw_sent` is defined as `void`, it seems the incoming change is likely correcting the function signature to be void (no return value needed). The `return 1;` in HEAD may have been added before the function signature was changed to void.

However, without seeing the function signature or more context about what the return value represents (if anything), I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The intent is ambiguous - it could be that:
1. The function should return an int (keep HEAD's version)
2. The function should be void (accept incoming change)
3. There's a different return value that should be used

Therefore, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
  Raw raw = (Raw)plug;
  c_write(raw, data, len);
  /* We count 'session start', for proxy logging purposes, as being
   * when data is received from the network and printed. */
  raw->session_started = TRUE;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return 1;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

static void raw_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  Raw raw = (Raw)plug;
```
