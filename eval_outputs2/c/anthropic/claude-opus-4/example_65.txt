Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to fix a typo in the same comment. The conflict is about the spelling of "explicitly":

- HEAD has: "explictly" (which is a typo)
- The incoming change has: "explicitly" (which is the correct spelling)

Since both sides have the same intent (the comment explains the same behavior) and the incoming change fixes the typo, the resolution should use the correctly spelled version.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
    }
  }

  /* After an erase of lines from the top of the screen, we shouldn't
   * bring the lines back again if the terminal enlarges (since the user or
   * application has explicitly thrown them away). */
  if (erasing_lines_from_top && !(term->alt_which))
    term->tempsblines = 0;
}

/*
