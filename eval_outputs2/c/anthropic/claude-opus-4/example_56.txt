Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to format the display string for TTY modes, but they have different approaches:

- HEAD: Simple ternary operator checking if `val[0] == 'A'` to show "(auto)" or `val + 1`
- The other branch: Extended logic that also checks for `val[0] == 'N'` to show "(don't send)"

The semantic intent is clear: the second branch is adding support for an additional mode ('N' for "don't send") while maintaining the existing 'A' for "(auto)" functionality. This is an enhancement that should be preserved.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
      dlg_update_start(ctrl, dlg);
      dlg_listbox_clear(ctrl, dlg);
      for (val = conf_get_str_strs(conf, CONF_ttymodes, NULL, &key);
           val != NULL;
           val = conf_get_str_strs(conf, CONF_ttymodes, key, &key)) {
        char *disp = dupprintf(
            "%s\t%s",
            key,
            (val[0] == 'A') ? "(auto)"
                            : ((val[0] == 'N') ? "(don't send)" : val + 1));
        dlg_listbox_add(ctrl, dlg, disp);
        sfree(disp);
      }
      dlg_update_done(ctrl, dlg);

```
