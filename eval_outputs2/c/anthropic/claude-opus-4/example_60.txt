Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) has just the `x_get_default` function, while the other side is trying to add a `buildinfo_gtk_relevant` constant declaration before the GTK version check.

Based on the semantic intent:
- The HEAD side wants to keep the code as is
- The other side wants to add a constant that appears to be related to GTK build information
- The constant is being placed logically before the GTK version check code

The semantic resolution should include both changes since they don't conflict in terms of functionality - one is adding a function, the other is adding a constant declaration. Here's the resolved version:

```c
char *x_get_default(const char *key)
{
  return NULL;
}

const int buildinfo_gtk_relevant = TRUE;

#if !GTK_CHECK_VERSION(3, 0, 0)
/* This front end only works in GTK 3. If that's not what we've got,
 * it's easier to just turn this program into a trivial stub by ifdef
 * in the source than it is to remove it in the makefile edifice. */
int main(int argc, char **argv)
