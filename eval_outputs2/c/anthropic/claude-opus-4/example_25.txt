Looking at this merge conflict, it appears to be a version control metadata conflict in the header comments of a C source file. Both sides are trying to update the `$Id$` line with different revision information.

The HEAD version shows:
- Version 1.11
- Date: 2003/08/24 20:38:24
- Author: guus

The incoming version shows:
- Version 1.6.4.43 (appears to be from a different branch)
- Date: 2003/08/08 22:11:54
- Author: guus

Since the HEAD version has a later date (August 24 vs August 8) and appears to be from the main development line (version 1.11 vs a branch version 1.6.4.43), the semantic intent would typically be to keep the more recent/main branch version.

Here's the resolved version:
