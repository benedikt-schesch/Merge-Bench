Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD (current branch): Returns 1 at the end of the function
- The incoming change: Removes the return statement entirely

Given the context, this appears to be a function that handles port forwarding data. The conflict is about whether the function should return a value or not.

Looking at the code structure:
1. The function appears to handle writing data to a channel
2. It sets throttling flags when data is written
3. The dispute is only about the return value

Without seeing the function signature or how it's called, I cannot definitively determine which approach is correct. The semantic intent is ambiguous - one side wants the function to return a status value (1), while the other wants it to return nothing (void function).

Since I cannot determine the correct resolution with certainty, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
    if (sshfwd_write(pf->c, data, len) > 0) {
      pf->throttled = 1;
      sk_set_frozen(pf->s, 1);
    }
  }
