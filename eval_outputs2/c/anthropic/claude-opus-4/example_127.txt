Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the semantic intent of both sides.

The conflict is about the return statement when socket `s` is not found:
- HEAD version: `return 1;` - returns an integer value (1)
- Other version: `return;` - returns void

To resolve this semantically, I need to consider what the function's return type likely is. Since one side returns an integer and the other returns void, I cannot definitively determine the correct return type without seeing the function signature.

Given the ambiguity about the function's return type and the impossibility of determining the correct semantic intent without additional context, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```c
  u_long atmark;

  /* Find the Socket structure */
  s = find234(sktree, &fd, cmpforsearch);
  if (!s)
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return 1; /* boggle */
=======
    return; /* boggle */
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5

  switch (event) {
  case 4: /* exceptional */
