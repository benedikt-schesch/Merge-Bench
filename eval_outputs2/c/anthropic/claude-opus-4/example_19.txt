Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the only difference between the two versions is in the `getopt_long` argument string:

- HEAD version: `"dvi:b:a:t:u:x:"`
- Incoming version: `"dvi:b:a:t:x:"`

The HEAD version includes `u:` while the incoming version does not. This suggests that HEAD added support for a `-u` option that takes an argument (indicated by the colon after 'u').

Without seeing the rest of the switch statement or knowing the full intent, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The `u:` option might be intentionally removed in the incoming branch, or it might be a feature that should be kept.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
        { "xcode", required_argument, NULL, 'x' },
        { NULL, 0, NULL, 0 },
    };
    char ch;

<<<<<<< HEAD
    while ((ch = getopt_long(argc, argv, "dvi:b:a:t:u:x:", longopts, NULL)) != -1)
=======
    while ((ch = getopt_long(argc, argv, "dvi:b:a:t:x:", longopts, NULL)) != -1)
>>>>>>> 05f934d5013ca01de31ec6e500551c233ed71593
    {
        switch (ch) {
        case 'd':
            debug = 1;
            break;

```
