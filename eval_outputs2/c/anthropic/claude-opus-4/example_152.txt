Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch adds a `return 1;` statement after the closing braces, while the other branch (4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5) doesn't have this return statement.

Given the context and the fact that this appears to be the end of a function (followed by a comment about special error values for different functions), the semantic intent seems clear: HEAD is adding a return value to this function, likely to indicate success (returning 1).

Here's the resolved code:

```c
    } else if (plug_accepting(s->plug, sk_tcp_accept, actx)) {
      p_closesocket(t); /* denied or error */
    }
  }
  }

  return 1;
}

/*
 * Special error values are returned from sk_namelookup and sk_new
 * if there's a problem. These functions extract an error message,
```

The resolution includes the `return 1;` statement from HEAD, as it appears to be providing the necessary return value for the function.
