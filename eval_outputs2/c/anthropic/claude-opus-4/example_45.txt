Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to allocate memory for a `past_request_t` structure, but they differ in style:

- HEAD version: Uses explicit cast `(past_request_t *)` before `xmalloc`
- Other branch: Removes the explicit cast

In C, `malloc` and related functions return `void*` which automatically converts to any pointer type, so the cast is unnecessary. The semantic intent of both versions is identical - to allocate memory for the structure.

Since this appears to be a style preference conflict rather than a functional one, and modern C style generally recommends avoiding unnecessary casts (as they can hide errors), I'll resolve in favor of the cleaner version without the cast:

```c

	if(avl_search(past_request_tree, &p)) {
		ifdebug(SCARY_THINGS) logger(LOG_DEBUG, _("Already seen request"));
		return true;
	} else {
		new = xmalloc(sizeof(*new));
		new->request = xstrdup(request);
		new->firstseen = now;
		avl_insert(past_request_tree, new);
		return false;
	}

```
