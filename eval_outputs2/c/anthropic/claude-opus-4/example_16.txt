Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the `GDB_SHELL` path, but they differ in how they specify the Developer tools location:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Uses `` `xcode-select -print-path` `` to dynamically determine the Xcode path
- **Incoming change**: Uses a hardcoded path `/Developer/`

The semantic intent appears to be defining the path to the GDB debugger. The HEAD version is more flexible and modern, as it uses `xcode-select` to find the current Xcode installation path dynamically, which is the preferred approach since Xcode can be installed in different locations. The incoming change uses an older hardcoded path that was common in earlier versions of Xcode.

Given that the HEAD version is more robust and follows current best practices, I'll resolve the conflict by keeping the HEAD version:

```c
#include <pwd.h>
#include "MobileDevice.h"

#define FDVENDOR_PATH  "/tmp/fruitstrap-remote-debugserver"
#define PREP_CMDS_PATH "/tmp/fruitstrap-gdb-prep-cmds"
#define GDB_SHELL      "`xcode-select -print-path`/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/libexec/gdb/gdb-arm-apple-darwin --arch armv7f -i mi -q -x " PREP_CMDS_PATH

// approximation of what Xcode does:
#define GDB_PREP_CMDS CFSTR("set mi-show-protections off\n\
    set auto-raise-load-levels 1\n\
    set shlib-path-substitutions /usr \"{ds_path}/Symbols/usr\" /System \"{ds_path}/Symbols/System\" \"{device_container}\" \"{disk_container}\" \"/private{device_container}\" \"{disk_container}\" /Developer \"{ds_path}/Symbols/Developer\"\n\

```
