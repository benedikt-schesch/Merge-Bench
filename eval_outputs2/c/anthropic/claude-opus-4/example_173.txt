Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides.

The conflict is about whether the function should return a value or not:
- HEAD version: includes `return 1;`
- The other branch: removes the return statement

Without seeing the full function signature and usage context, it's difficult to determine which is correct. The function appears to be handling an error/close condition for a pageant connection, freeing resources and then either returning 1 or not returning anything.

Since I cannot determine the correct intent without more context (like the function signature, what the return value represents, and how it's used by callers), I'll preserve the conflict as requested:

```c
    plog(pc->logctx, pc->logfn, "%p: error: %s", pc, error_msg);
  else
    plog(pc->logctx, pc->logfn, "%p: connection closed", pc);
  sk_close(pc->connsock);
  sfree(pc);
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return 1;

}

static void pageant_conn_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  /* struct pageant_conn_state *pc = (struct pageant_conn_state *)plug; */

```
