Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- `HEAD` side: Uses `crFinish(1);` which appears to be a coroutine macro that finishes with a return value of 1
- The other side: Uses `crFinishV;` which appears to be a coroutine macro that finishes with no return value (void)

Without more context about the function signature and the coroutine system being used, I cannot determine which version is semantically correct. The conflict represents a fundamental disagreement about whether this coroutine should return a value or not.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
      sk_write(pc->connsock, reply, replylen);
      smemclr(reply, replylen);
    }
  }

<<<<<<< HEAD
  crFinish(1);

}

struct pageant_listen_state {
  const struct plug_function_table *fn;
  /* the above variable absolutely *must* be the first in this structure */

```
