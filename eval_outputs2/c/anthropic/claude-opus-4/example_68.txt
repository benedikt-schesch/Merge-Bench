Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call a function to make the list control draggable, but they're using different function names:

- HEAD uses: `MakeDragList(ctl);`
- The incoming change uses: `p_MakeDragList(ctl);`

The `p_` prefix typically indicates a function pointer or a dynamically loaded function (often used when functions are loaded from DLLs at runtime). Since both sides have the same intent (making the list draggable) but differ in the implementation approach, I cannot determine which is correct without more context about the codebase's architecture.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
                    WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_TABSTOP | WS_VSCROLL |
                        LBS_HASSTRINGS | LBS_USETABSTOPS,
                    WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE,
                    "",
                    listid);
<<<<<<< HEAD
        MakeDragList(ctl);
=======
        p_MakeDragList(ctl);
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
      }
      break;

    case 2:
      /* The "Up" and "Down" buttons. */

```
