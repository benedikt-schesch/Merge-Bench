No reasoning found</think>
Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to set the `tv.tv_sec` value, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Sets `tv.tv_sec = 1 + (rand() & 7)` with a comment explaining this creates approximately 5 seconds with randomization to prevent global synchronization effects
- **Other branch**: Comments out the randomized approach and sets a fixed `tv.tv_sec = 1`

The semantic intent appears to be that the other branch wants to disable the randomization feature and use a fixed 1-second timeout instead. Since the other branch explicitly commented out the randomized version rather than just deleting it, this suggests it might be a temporary change or they want to preserve the option to re-enable it later.

Given this analysis, here's the resolved version that preserves the intent of the other branch (fixed timeout) while keeping the commented randomization code for reference:

```c
	running = true;

	while(running) {
		now = time(NULL);

	//	tv.tv_sec = 1 + (rand() & 7);	/* Approx. 5 seconds, randomized to prevent global synchronisation effects */
		tv.tv_sec = 1;
		tv.tv_usec = 0;

		maxfd = build_fdset(&fset);

		r = select(maxfd + 1, &fset, NULL, NULL, &tv);

```
