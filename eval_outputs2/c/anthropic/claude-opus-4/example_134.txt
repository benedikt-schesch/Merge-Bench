Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- The HEAD branch (top) wants to set `connopen = 1;` after the connection setup
- The other branch (bottom) removed this line entirely

Without more context about what `connopen` represents and how it's used elsewhere in the code, I cannot determine whether this variable assignment should be kept or removed. The conflict appears to be about whether to track the connection state with this variable.

Since the intent is ambiguous without knowing the broader codebase changes, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
    }
    back->provide_logctx(backhandle, logctx);
    ldisc_create(conf, NULL, back, backhandle, NULL);
    sfree(realhost);
  }
<<<<<<< HEAD
