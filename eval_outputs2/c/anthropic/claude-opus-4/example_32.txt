Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's about type casting when accessing `nnode->data`. 

The HEAD version explicitly casts to `(node_t *)` while the incoming change removes the cast. Since this appears to be C code and the variable `n` is likely already declared as `node_t *`, the explicit cast in the HEAD version is probably unnecessary but harmless.

Both versions achieve the same semantic intent - assigning the node data to variable `n`. The incoming change simply removes redundant casting.

Here's the resolved version, choosing the cleaner approach without the cast:

```c

	/* Remove all edges and subnets owned by unreachable nodes. */

	for(nnode = node_tree->head; nnode; nnode = nnext) {
		nnext = nnode->next;
		n = nnode->data;

		if(!n->status.reachable) {
			ifdebug(SCARY_THINGS) logger(LOG_DEBUG, _("Purging node %s (%s)"), n->name,
					   n->hostname);


```
