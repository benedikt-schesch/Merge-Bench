Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to declare Windows functions, but they're declaring different functions:

- HEAD side: Declares `MakeSignature` function
- The other side: Declares `AddDllDirectory` function

Since both declarations appear to be independent and serve different purposes (one for security/signing, one for DLL directory management), the semantic intent seems to be to include both function declarations. Here's the resolved conflict:

```c
                      (PCtxtHandle, ULONG, PVOID));
DECL_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(static,
                      SECURITY_STATUS,
                      MakeSignature,
                      (PCtxtHandle, ULONG, PSecBufferDesc, ULONG));
DECL_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(static, DLL_DIRECTORY_COOKIE, AddDllDirectory, (PCWSTR));

typedef struct winSsh_gss_ctx {
  unsigned long maj_stat;
  unsigned long min_stat;
  CredHandle cred_handle;

```
