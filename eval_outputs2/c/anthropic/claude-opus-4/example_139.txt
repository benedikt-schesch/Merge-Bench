Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is trying to add a variable declaration `int ret = TRUE;` at the beginning of the `pty_select_result` function, while the other branch (4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5) doesn't have this variable.

Without more context about how `ret` is used later in the function, or what the intent of adding this variable is, I cannot determine the correct resolution. The conflict appears to be about whether this return value variable should be initialized at the start of the function or not.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

void pty_select_result(int fd, int event)
{
<<<<<<< HEAD
  int ret = TRUE;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
  Pty pty;

  if (fd == pty_signal_pipe[0]) {
    pid_t pid;
    int status;

```
