Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- **HEAD** uses `memmove` with `countSize` and includes a comment explaining it's used "in case count & Counting1 are overlapping"
- **The other branch** uses `memcpy` with `(maxSymbolValue+1) * 4` as the size

The key semantic difference is:
1. `memmove` is safe for overlapping memory regions (as the comment indicates)
2. `memcpy` is faster but unsafe for overlapping regions
3. The size calculation differs: `countSize` vs `(maxSymbolValue+1) * 4`

Given that the HEAD version explicitly chose `memmove` for safety reasons (overlapping memory) and includes a comment explaining this choice, the safer resolution would be to use `memmove`. However, the size calculation from the other branch `(maxSymbolValue+1) * 4` appears to be more precise as it only copies up to the actual maximum symbol value rather than potentially the full `countSize`.

The best resolution combines the safety of `memmove` with the more efficient size calculation:

```c

    {   unsigned maxSymbolValue = 255;
        while (!Counting1[maxSymbolValue]) maxSymbolValue--;
        if (check && maxSymbolValue > *maxSymbolValuePtr) return ERROR(maxSymbolValue_tooSmall);
        *maxSymbolValuePtr = maxSymbolValue;
        memmove(count, Counting1, (maxSymbolValue+1) * 4);   /* in case count & Counting1 are overlapping */
    }
    return (size_t)max;
}
