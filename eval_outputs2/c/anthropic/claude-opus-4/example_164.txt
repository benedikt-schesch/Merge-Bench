Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD version: `connopen &= select_result(wp, lp);` - This updates the `connopen` variable by AND-ing it with the return value of `select_result()`
- Other branch: `select_result(wp, lp);` - This simply calls `select_result()` without using its return value

The key difference is whether to track the return value of `select_result()` in the `connopen` variable. Without more context about what `connopen` represents and how it's used later, I cannot determine which approach is correct. The HEAD version suggests that `connopen` is tracking some kind of connection state that depends on the select results, while the other branch ignores this.

Since the intent is ambiguous without understanding the broader context of how `connopen` is used, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```c
          for (e = 0; e < lenof(eventtypes); e++)
            if (things.lNetworkEvents & eventtypes[e].mask) {
              LPARAM lp;
              int err = things.iErrorCode[eventtypes[e].bit];
              lp = WSAMAKESELECTREPLY(eventtypes[e].mask, err);

    } else if (n == WAIT_OBJECT_0 + nhandles + 1) {
      MSG msg;
