Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version control conflict in the file header comments, specifically in the CVS/RCS version identifier line (`$Id$`). 

Both sides are trying to update the version information:
- HEAD has: `$Id: net.c,v 1.40 2003/08/24 20:38:24 guus Exp $`
- The other branch has: `$Id: net.c,v 1.35.4.203 2003/12/20 19:47:52 guus Exp $`

The second version (1.35.4.203) appears to be from a branch (note the 4-part version number) and has a later date (December vs August), suggesting it's the more recent change.

Here's the resolved code:
