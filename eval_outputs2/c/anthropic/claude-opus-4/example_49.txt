Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one branch (HEAD) has the includes ending with `<getopt.h>`, while the other branch adds `#include <pidfile.h>` after it.

Since this appears to be a simple additive change where one branch is adding an additional include file, the semantic intent seems clear: both includes should be present. The conflict arose because they were added at the same location by different branches.

Here's the resolved version:

```c
#include <openssl/evp.h>

#include <lzo1x.h>

#include <getopt.h>
#include <pidfile.h>

#include "conf.h"
#include "device.h"
#include "logger.h"
#include "net.h"

```
