Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are modifying the function signature for `agent_select_result`. The conflict is about the return type:

- HEAD version: `static int agent_select_result(int fd, int event)`
- Other version: `static void agent_select_result(int fd, int event)`

Without more context about how this function is used (especially whether callers expect a return value), I cannot determine which return type is semantically correct. The intent is ambiguous without seeing:
1. How this function is called
2. Whether the function body returns any values
3. What the broader changes in each branch were trying to achieve

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unresolved:

```c
  close(conn->fd);
  del234(agent_pending_queries, conn);
  sfree(conn);
}

<<<<<<< HEAD

{
  agent_pending_query *conn;

  assert(event == 1); /* not selecting for anything but R */
