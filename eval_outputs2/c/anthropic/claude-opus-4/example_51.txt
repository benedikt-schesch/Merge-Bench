Looking at this merge conflict, I can see two different additions being made:

1. The HEAD branch is adding a configuration function declaration for response type configuration
2. The incoming branch (e2ef03b27ff049632b3238dfa6ec88c54a39c4ae) is adding two static function declarations for file cache operations

Since these are non-overlapping additions that serve different purposes, the semantic intent is to include both sets of function declarations. Here's the resolved version:

```c
char       *ngx_http_uwsgi_cache_purge_conf(ngx_conf_t *cf,
        ngx_command_t *cmd, void *conf);
ngx_int_t   ngx_http_uwsgi_cache_purge_handler(ngx_http_request_t *r);
# endif /* NGX_HTTP_UWSGI */

char        *ngx_http_cache_purge_response_type_conf(ngx_conf_t *cf, 
                ngx_command_t *cmd, void *conf);

static ngx_int_t
ngx_http_purge_file_cache_noop(ngx_tree_ctx_t *ctx, ngx_str_t *path);
static ngx_int_t
ngx_http_purge_file_cache_delete_file(ngx_tree_ctx_t *ctx, ngx_str_t *path);

ngx_int_t   ngx_http_cache_purge_access_handler(ngx_http_request_t *r);
ngx_int_t   ngx_http_cache_purge_access(ngx_array_t *a, ngx_array_t *a6,
                                        struct sockaddr *s);
