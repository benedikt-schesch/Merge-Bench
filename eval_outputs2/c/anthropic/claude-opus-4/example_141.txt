Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the semantic intent of both sides:

**HEAD (current branch):**
- Calls `pty_real_select_result()` and uses its return value
- Performs a logical AND operation with `ret`
- Returns the combined result

**Incoming change (commit 4348393...):**
- Simply calls `pty_real_select_result()` without capturing its return value
- Doesn't return anything

The key difference is that HEAD cares about the return value and propagates it, while the incoming change treats it as a void operation. Without more context about the function's return type and purpose, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict as the intent is ambiguous - one side wants to track and return a result while the other doesn't.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
    } while (pid > 0);
  } else {
    pty = find234(ptys_by_fd, &fd, pty_find_by_fd);

    if (pty)
<<<<<<< HEAD
      ret = ret && pty_real_select_result(pty, event, 0);
  }

  return ret;
=======
      pty_real_select_result(pty, event, 0);
  }
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

static void pty_uxsel_setup(Pty pty)
{
  int rwx;

```
