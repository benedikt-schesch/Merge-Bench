Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Declares three variables: `int i, j, ivlen;`
- The other branch: Declares only two variables: `int i, ivlen;`

The difference is that HEAD includes an additional variable `j`. Without more context about how these variables are used in the subsequent code, I cannot determine if `j` is actually needed or if it was removed intentionally in the other branch.

Since the conflict involves variable declarations where one side has an extra variable that might be used later in the code, and I cannot determine the intent without seeing how these variables are used, I'll preserve the conflict as is:

```c
        }
        p += 2;
        if (!strcmp(p, "ENCRYPTED"))
          ret->encrypted = TRUE;
      } else if (!strcmp(line, "DEK-Info")) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        int i, j, ivlen;
=======
        int i, ivlen;
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5

        if (!strncmp(p, "DES-EDE3-CBC,", 13)) {
          ret->encryption = OP_E_3DES;
          ivlen = 8;
        } else if (!strncmp(p, "AES-128-CBC,", 12)) {
```
