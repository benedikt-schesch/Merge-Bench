Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to pass a `result` variable to what appears to be a macro or function call, but they differ in whether to cast it to unsigned.

Without more context about what `result` is and what the receiving function expects, I cannot definitively determine which approach is correct. The conflict appears to be about type handling - one side wants the raw `result` value while the other wants to ensure it's treated as unsigned.

Since the intent is ambiguous without knowing more about the surrounding code and the expected type of the parameter, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
             #func,                                                            \
             #string,                                                          \
             #arg2,                                                            \
             #suffix,                                                          \
             ret,                                                              \

    }                                                                          \
