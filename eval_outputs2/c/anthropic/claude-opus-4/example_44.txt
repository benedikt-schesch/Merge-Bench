Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (the branch being merged in) is adding a global variable declaration `bool tunnelserver = false;` while HEAD doesn't have this addition.

Since this appears to be a simple addition of a new variable declaration and there's no conflicting code in HEAD at this location, the semantic intent seems clear - to introduce this new global variable. The resolution should include this addition.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
#include "meta.h"
#include "protocol.h"
#include "utils.h"
#include "xalloc.h"

bool tunnelserver = false;

/* Jumptable for the request handlers */

static bool (*request_handlers[])(connection_t *) = {
		id_h, metakey_h, challenge_h, chal_reply_h, ack_h,
		status_h, error_h, termreq_h,

```
