Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic difference between the two versions:

- HEAD version: `return plug_receive(s->plug, 2, buf, ret);`
- Other version: `plug_receive(s->plug, 2, buf, ret);`

The key difference is that HEAD includes a `return` statement while the other version does not. This is inside an `else` block that appears to be part of error handling logic.

Without more context about the function's return type and the broader control flow, I cannot definitively determine which version is correct. The semantic intent could be either:
1. The function should return the value from `plug_receive` (HEAD version)
2. The function should call `plug_receive` but continue execution (other version)

Since the intent is ambiguous without more context, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
      /* We're inside the Windows frontend here, so we know
       * that the frontend handle is unnecessary. */
      logevent(NULL, str);
      fatalbox("%s", str);
    } else {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      return plug_receive(s->plug, 2, buf, ret);
=======
      plug_receive(s->plug, 2, buf, ret);
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
    }
    break;
  case FD_WRITE: {
    int bufsize_before, bufsize_after;
    s->writable = 1;
