Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that HEAD wants to add a `return 0;` statement after the `connection_fatal` call, while the other branch (4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5) does not have this return statement.

Based on the context, this appears to be the end of a function (likely an error handling function) followed by the start of another function `ssh_receive`. The semantic intent seems to be:
- HEAD: The function should explicitly return 0 after handling the fatal connection error
- Other branch: The function ends without an explicit return statement

Without knowing the function signature and return type, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The presence or absence of the return statement could be significant depending on whether this is a void function or one that returns an int/error code.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c

  if (error_msg)
    logevent(error_msg);
  if (!ssh->close_expected || !ssh->clean_exit)
    connection_fatal(ssh->frontend, "%s", error_msg);
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return 0;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

static void ssh_receive(Plug plug, int urgent, char *data, int len)
{
  Ssh ssh = (Ssh)plug;

```
