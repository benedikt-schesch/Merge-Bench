Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD version: checks both `connopen` and `back->connected(backhandle)`
- Incoming version: only checks `back->connected(backhandle)`

The HEAD version appears to add an additional condition (`connopen`) that must be true along with the backend being connected. This suggests `connopen` is a flag that tracks whether the connection should be considered open from the application's perspective, providing an additional layer of state checking beyond just the backend's connected status.

Since the HEAD version is more restrictive (requiring both conditions) and appears to be adding intentional additional state checking, the semantic resolution should preserve both conditions:

```c

    if (FD_ISSET(STDIN_FILENO, &rset)) {
      char buf[4096];
      int ret;

      if (connopen && back->connected(backhandle)) {
        ret = read(STDIN_FILENO, buf, sizeof(buf));
        if (ret < 0) {
          perror("stdin: read");
          exit(1);
        } else if (ret == 0) {

```
