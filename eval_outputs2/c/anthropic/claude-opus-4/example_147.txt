Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides.

The conflict is about the return value of a `plug_receive` call:
- HEAD version: `return plug_receive(ps->plug, 0, data, len);`
- Other version: calls `plug_receive` but explicitly returns 0

This appears to be a case where one side wants to propagate the return value from `plug_receive`, while the other side wants to always return 0 regardless of what `plug_receive` returns.

Without more context about the expected behavior and what the caller expects, I cannot determine which semantic intent is correct. The function containing this code might expect:
1. The actual return value from `plug_receive` (HEAD's intent)
2. Always 0 after calling `plug_receive` (other branch's intent)

Since the intent is ambiguous without understanding the broader system's expectations, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```c
       * And return a very large backlog, to prevent further
       * data arriving from winhandl until we unfreeze.
       */
      return INT_MAX;
    } else {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      return plug_receive(ps->plug, 0, data, len);
=======
      plug_receive(ps->plug, 0, data, len);
      return 0;
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
    }
  }
}

static int handle_stderr(struct handle *h, void *data, int len)
