Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - properly destroying the object at `items[size_active]` when popping from the back of what appears to be a vector-like container.

The HEAD version uses the standard C++ allocator traits approach with `std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy()`, while the incoming change uses direct destructor invocation with `items[size_active].~T()`.

The `std::allocator_traits::destroy()` approach is more general and correct because:
1. It properly handles custom allocators that might have specialized destroy methods
2. It's the standard-compliant way to destroy objects in allocated storage
3. It will work correctly even if the allocator has a custom destroy implementation

Therefore, the HEAD version should be preferred:

```c

      __forceinline void pop_back() 
      {
        assert(!empty());
        size_active--;
        std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy(alloc, &items[size_active]);
      }

      __forceinline void clear() 
      {
        /* destroy elements */

```
