Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to log an error message, but with some differences:

1. **HEAD (current branch)**: 
   - Adds a condition `if (op_errno != EAGAIN)`
   - Uses `GF_LOG_ERROR` log level
   - Uses `PRId64` format specifier

2. **Incoming change**:
   - No condition (logs for all cases)
   - Uses `GF_LOG_WARNING` log level
   - Uses `PRIu64` format specifier

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD wants to avoid logging EAGAIN errors (which are typically temporary "try again" errors)
- HEAD considers this an ERROR level issue
- The incoming change treats all cases as WARNING level

The most sensible resolution would be to keep the EAGAIN condition from HEAD (as it's a common pattern to not log temporary failures) but we need to resolve the format specifier and log level conflicts. Since the context shows this is an error path and the format specifier should match the data type of `frame->root->unique`, I'll preserve the conflict as the intent is ambiguous regarding whether this should be ERROR or WARNING level, and which format specifier is correct.

```c
                                gf_log ("glusterfs-fuse", GF_LOG_ERROR,
                                        "SETLK not supported. loading "
                                        "'features/posix-locks' on server side "
                                        "will add SETLK support.");
                        }

                send_fuse_err (this, state->finh, op_errno);
        }
