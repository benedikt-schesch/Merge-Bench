Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to play a sound file, but they have different approaches:

- HEAD: Direct call to `PlaySound()`
- The other branch: Checks if `p_PlaySound` exists before calling it (likely for dynamic loading/compatibility)

The semantic intent of the second branch appears to be adding a safety check to ensure the PlaySound function pointer is available before using it. This is a common pattern for dynamically loaded functions or for compatibility across different Windows versions.

Here's the resolved conflict that preserves the safety check while maintaining the same functionality:

```c
     * time _after_ it finishes rather than before it starts.
     */
    lastbeep = GetTickCount();
  } else if (mode == BELL_WAVEFILE) {
    Filename *bell_wavefile = conf_get_filename(conf, CONF_bell_wavefile);
    if (!p_PlaySound ||
        !p_PlaySound(bell_wavefile->path, NULL, SND_ASYNC | SND_FILENAME)) {
      char buf[sizeof(bell_wavefile->path) + 80];
      char otherbuf[100];
      sprintf(buf,
              "Unable to play sound file\n%s\n"
              "Using default sound instead",

```
