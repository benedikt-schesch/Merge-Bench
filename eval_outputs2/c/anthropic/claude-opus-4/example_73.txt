Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call what appears to be the same function to draw an insert marker, but with different function names:
- HEAD uses: `DrawInsert(hwnd, dlm->hWnd, -1);`
- The other branch uses: `p_DrawInsert(hwnd, dlm->hWnd, -1);`

The conflict appears to be a simple naming difference - one side has renamed the function from `DrawInsert` to `p_DrawInsert` (likely adding a prefix for some organizational purpose). Both calls have identical parameters and are in the same logical position in the code flow.

Since I cannot determine which naming convention is correct without more context about the codebase's naming standards or the broader refactoring intent, I'll return the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
      case DL_DROPPED:
        if (hdl->dragging) {
          dest = pl_itemfrompt(dlm->hWnd, dlm->ptCursor, TRUE);
          if (dest > hdl->dummyitem)
            dest = hdl->dummyitem;
<<<<<<< HEAD
          DrawInsert(hwnd, dlm->hWnd, -1);
=======
          p_DrawInsert(hwnd, dlm->hWnd, -1);
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
        }
        SendDlgItemMessage(
            hwnd, hdl->listid, LB_DELETESTRING, hdl->dummyitem, 0);
        if (hdl->dragging) {
          hdl->dragging = 0;

```
