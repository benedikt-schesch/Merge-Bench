Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) is adding a new configuration directive for `cache_purge_response_type`, while the other side removed it or never had it. The conflict appears to be about whether to include this cache purge response type configuration option.

Since I cannot determine the intent without more context about the project's requirements, I'll return the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```c
        0,
        NULL
    },
# endif /* NGX_HTTP_UWSGI */

<<<<<<< HEAD
    { ngx_string("cache_purge_response_type"),
      NGX_HTTP_MAIN_CONF|NGX_HTTP_SRV_CONF|NGX_HTTP_LOC_CONF|NGX_CONF_TAKE1,
      ngx_http_cache_purge_response_type_conf,
      NGX_HTTP_LOC_CONF_OFFSET,
      0,
      NULL },
