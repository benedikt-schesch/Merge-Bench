Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD wants to return 1 from this function
- The other branch (4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5) wants to end the function without a return statement

Given that this appears to be a plug function (based on the `plug` parameter) and is handling an error condition (closing a listening socket), the return value is likely meaningful. In many callback/plug interfaces, returning a value indicates whether the error was handled or whether further processing should occur.

Since HEAD explicitly adds a return statement, this suggests the function signature requires a return value, and the other branch may have been incomplete or had different assumptions about the function's requirements.

Here's the resolved version, keeping the return statement from HEAD:

```c
  struct ssh_sharing_state *sharestate = (struct ssh_sharing_state *)plug;
  if (error_msg)
    ssh_sharing_logf(sharestate->ssh, 0, "listening socket: %s", error_msg);
  sk_close(sharestate->listensock);
  sharestate->listensock = NULL;
  return 1;
}

static void share_send_verstring(struct ssh_sharing_connstate *cs)
{
  char *fullstring = dupcat("SSHCONNECTION@putty.projects.tartarus.org-2.0-",
```
