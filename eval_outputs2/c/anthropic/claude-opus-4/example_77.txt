Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to fix a typo in the same comment. The conflict is purely about spelling:

- HEAD has: "definitly"
- The incoming change has: "definitely" (which is the correct spelling)

Since both sides have the same intent - to have this comment in the code - and the incoming change has the correct spelling, the resolution should use the correctly spelled version.

```c
      /* This is so the ALT-Numpad and dead keys work correctly. */
      keys_unicode[0] = 0;

      return p - output;
    }
    /* If we're definitely not building up an ALT-54321 then clear it */
    if (!left_alt)
      keys_unicode[0] = 0;
    /* If we will be using alt_sum fix the 256s */
    else if (keys_unicode[0] && (in_utf(term) || ucsdata.dbcs_screenfont))
      keys_unicode[0] = 10;

```
