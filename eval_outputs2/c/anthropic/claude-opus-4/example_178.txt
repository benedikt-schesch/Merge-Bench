Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the context:

1. This appears to be error handling code that sends a reply indicating "atype not supported" (reply[1] = 8)
2. After sending the error reply, it closes the connection with `pfd_close(pf)`
3. The conflict is about what to return after this error handling

The two sides of the merge have different return types:
- HEAD wants to `return 1;` (suggesting the function returns an int, likely for error status)
- The other branch wants to `return;` (suggesting the function returns void)

Without more context about the function signature and the broader codebase changes, I cannot determine which return type is semantically correct. The intent is ambiguous - one branch may have changed the function to return an error code while the other kept it as void, or vice versa.

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```c
             * Unknown address type. (FIXME: support IPv6!)
             */
            reply[1] = 8; /* atype not supported */
            sk_write(pf->s, (char *)reply, lenof(reply));
            pfd_close(pf);
<<<<<<< HEAD
            return 1;
=======
            return;
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
          }
        }
      }
