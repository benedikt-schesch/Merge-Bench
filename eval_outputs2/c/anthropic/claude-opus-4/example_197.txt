Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add new fields to the `input_device` struct:

- HEAD is adding `int rotate;` - likely for handling device rotation
- The other branch is adding `bool is_touchscreen;` - for identifying touchscreen devices

Both changes appear to be independent additions that don't conflict semantically. They're both adding new device properties/capabilities to the struct. The logical resolution is to include both fields.

```c

struct input_device {
  struct libevdev *dev;
  bool is_keyboard;
  bool is_mouse;
  int rotate;
  bool is_touchscreen;
  struct mapping* map;
  int key_map[KEY_MAX];
  int abs_map[ABS_MAX];
  int hats_state[3][2];
  int fd;

```
