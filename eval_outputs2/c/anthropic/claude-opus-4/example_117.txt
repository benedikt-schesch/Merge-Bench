Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- The HEAD side (current branch) wants to return 0 at the end of this function
- The other side (branch 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5) appears to want to remove the return statement entirely, leaving just the closing brace

This appears to be at the end of a function that handles connection errors or normal closure. The comment "Otherwise, the remote side closed the connection normally" suggests this is the normal exit path.

Without more context about what this function should return, and given that one side explicitly wants a return value while the other doesn't, I cannot determine the correct resolution with certainty. The ambiguity lies in whether this function should return a value or not (possibly it changed from returning int to void, or vice versa).

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
  if (error_msg) {
    logevent(telnet->frontend, error_msg);
    connection_fatal(telnet->frontend, "%s", error_msg);
  }
  /* Otherwise, the remote side closed the connection normally. */
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return 0;

}

static void telnet_receive(Plug plug, int urgent, char *data, int len)
{
  Telnet telnet = (Telnet)plug;

```
