Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version adds a `return 1;` statement after the closing brace of what appears to be a switch statement or similar control structure, while the other branch (4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5) doesn't have this return statement.

Without more context about the function's return type and expected behavior, I cannot definitively determine which version is correct. The semantic intent is ambiguous - it could be that:
1. The function should return 1 to indicate success
2. The function should fall through to other code below
3. The function might have a different return statement elsewhere

Since the intent is ambiguous, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
      if (bufsize_after < bufsize_before)
        plug_sent(s->plug, bufsize_after);
    }
    break;
  }
