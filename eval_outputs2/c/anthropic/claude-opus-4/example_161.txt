Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the semantic intent of both sides:

- HEAD version: `if (connopen && back->connected(backhandle))`
- Incoming version: `if (back->connected(backhandle))`

The conflict is about whether to include the `connopen` check before checking if the backend is connected. 

Based on the context, this appears to be error handling code that writes to stdout/stderr and then potentially unthrottles the backend connection. The HEAD version adds an additional guard condition (`connopen`) before checking the backend connection status.

The semantic intent seems to be:
- HEAD wants to ensure both that `connopen` is true AND the backend is connected before unthrottling
- The incoming change only cares about whether the backend is connected

Without more context about what `connopen` represents and why it was added, the safer resolution would be to keep the more restrictive condition from HEAD, as it likely prevents some edge case issue.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
            "Unable to write to standard %s: %s\n",
            (h == stdout_handle ? "output" : "error"),
            buf);
    cleanup_exit(0);
  }
  if (connopen && back->connected(backhandle)) {
    back->unthrottle(
        backhandle,
        (handle_backlog(stdout_handle) + handle_backlog(stderr_handle)));
  }
}
```
