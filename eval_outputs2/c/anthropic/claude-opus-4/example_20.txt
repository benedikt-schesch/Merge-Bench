Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has added a new command-line option 'u' that sets an `unbuffered` flag to 1, while the other branch doesn't have this option. The conflict appears to be a simple addition where one branch has added functionality that the other branch doesn't have.

Since this seems to be an additive change (not conflicting logic), the semantic intent would be to keep the new option. Here's the resolved code:

```c
            verbose = 1;
            break;
        case 't':
            timeout = atoi(optarg);
            break;
        case 'u':
            unbuffered = 1;
            break;
        case 'x':
            developer_path = optarg;
            break;
        default:
            usage(argv[0]);

```
