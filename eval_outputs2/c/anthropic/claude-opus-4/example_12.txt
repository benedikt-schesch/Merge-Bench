Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to destroy elements before freeing memory, but using different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Uses `std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy(alloc, &items[i])` - the standard C++ allocator-aware way to destroy objects
- **Other branch**: Directly calls the destructor `items[i].~T()` - a more direct approach

Since the code is using an allocator (we can see `alloc.deallocate` below), the more appropriate and consistent approach is to use the allocator traits for destruction. This ensures proper handling for custom allocators that might have special destroy behavior.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
      }

      __forceinline void clear() 
      {
        /* destroy elements */
        for (size_t i=0; i<size_active; i++)
          std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy(alloc, &items[i]);
        
        /* free memory */
        alloc.deallocate(items,size_alloced); 
        items = nullptr;
        size_active = size_alloced = 0;

```
