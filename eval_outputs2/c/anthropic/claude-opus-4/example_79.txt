Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the conflict is about whether to include a constant declaration `buildinfo_gtk_relevant` between the end of one function and the start of `gtk_askpass_main`.

The HEAD version (current branch) has nothing between the two functions, while the incoming change adds a constant declaration. This appears to be a straightforward addition that doesn't conflict with the intent of the HEAD version - it's simply adding a new constant that's likely used elsewhere in the codebase.

Here's the resolved version:

```c

  gtk_initialised = ret;
  return ret;
}

const int buildinfo_gtk_relevant = TRUE;

char *gtk_askpass_main(const char *display,
                       const char *wintitle,
                       const char *prompt,
                       int *success)
{

```
