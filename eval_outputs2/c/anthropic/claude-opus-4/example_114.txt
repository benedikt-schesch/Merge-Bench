Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the context of the `crGetChar` macro and what both sides are trying to achieve.

This appears to be a coroutine-style macro (note the `cr` prefix and the use of `__LINE__` for resumption points). The macro seems to implement a character-reading operation that can yield/suspend execution when no data is available (`len == 0`).

The conflict is about the return statement:
- HEAD version: `return 1;`
- Other version: `return;`

In coroutine implementations, the return value typically indicates the state:
- Returning a value (like 1) often means "not done, will resume"
- Returning void might indicate completion or a different design pattern

Without more context about the broader codebase and the coroutine framework being used, I cannot definitively determine which return statement is correct. The semantic intent is ambiguous - one side expects a return value while the other expects void.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
  }
#define crGetChar(c)                                                           \
  do {                                                                         \
    while (len == 0) {                                                         \
      *crLine = __LINE__;                                                      \

      return;                                                                  \

    }                                                                          \
    len--;                                                                     \
    (c) = (unsigned char)*data++;                                              \
  } while (0)
