Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to fix the same issue but in slightly different ways:

- HEAD version: Reformats the printf to split across multiple lines
- Other version: Also reformats the printf across multiple lines AND adds a cast `(unsigned)l` to the last parameter

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to improve code formatting by breaking the long printf statement
2. The other branch additionally wants to ensure proper type handling by casting `l` to unsigned

Since the cast to `(unsigned)` is likely addressing a potential type mismatch or warning (printing a signed value with %08x which expects unsigned), and both sides agree on the formatting improvement, the resolution should include both changes.

Here's the resolved code:

```c
      printf("%d: correct string shorter than output\n", line);
      total_errs++;
      break;
    }
    if (l != str[i]) {
      printf("%d: char %d came out as %08x, should be %08x\n",
             line,
             i,
             str[i],
             (unsigned)l);
      total_errs++;
    }
  }
  if (l != -1) {
    l = va_arg(ap, long int);

```
