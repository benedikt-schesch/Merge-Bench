Based on the semantic analysis of both changes, here's the resolved snippet preserving context and intent:

```c
                           &realhost,
                           conf_get_int(inst->conf, CONF_tcp_nodelay),
                           conf_get_int(inst->conf, CONF_tcp_keepalives));

  if (error) {
    char *msg = dupprintf("Unable to open connection to %s:\n%s",
                          conf_dest(inst->conf),
                          error);
    inst->exited = TRUE;
    fatal_message_box(inst->window, msg);
    sfree(msg);
    exit(0);
  }

```

Resolution reasoning:
1. The branch change (4348393f) introduces `conf_dest()` which appears to be a more comprehensive destination formatter (likely including host+port)
2. The HEAD change uses raw `conf_get_str()` which only fetches the hostname
3. The branch version is semantically superior as it provides more complete connection information
4. Formatting is preserved using HEAD's multi-line argument style for consistency with surrounding code
5. The change maintains error message clarity while improving information quality

The resolution keeps the branch's functional improvement (`conf_dest`) while preserving HEAD's code formatting style for readability.
