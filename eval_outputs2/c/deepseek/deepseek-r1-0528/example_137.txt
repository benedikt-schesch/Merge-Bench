The merge conflict involves a discrepancy in the control flow after handling `event == 2`. Both branches have valid but conflicting intentions:

1. **HEAD branch**: Returns `1` immediately after handling the event, plus adds an additional return statement at the end of the function block.
2. **Other branch** (`4348393`): Only closes the `else if` block without explicit returns.

The function's control flow and return requirements are ambiguous without seeing the full function signature and surrounding logic. Since the intent cannot be determined from the given snippet, the conflict remains unresolved.

```c
    }
  } else if (event == 2) {
    assert(fd == s->to_cmd);
    if (localproxy_try_send(s))
      plug_sent(s->plug, bufchain_size(&s->pending_output_data));
