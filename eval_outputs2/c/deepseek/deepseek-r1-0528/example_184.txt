Since the intent behind the conflicting changes is ambiguous without additional context, I return the original snippet with the conflict markers preserved. Here's the exact output:

```c
		case KEY_HELP:
			execlp("man", "man", "mount.fuse", NULL);
		case KEY_VERSION:
			return -1;
		case FUSE_OPT_KEY_OPT:
<<<<<<< HEAD
			fprintf(stderr, "kee %s", arg);
=======
>>>>>>> 6ffa9ed1f1c5bd00eeb732e207b2dcbadc7c87fc
			break;
		case FUSE_OPT_KEY_NONOPT:
			if (!state->rootdir) {
				state->rootdir = realpath(arg, NULL);
				if (!state->rootdir) {
```

**Reasoning:**  
The conflict shows two competing changes:
1. HEAD adds a `fprintf()` statement for debugging/error handling
2. The other branch completely removes this print statement  

Without knowing:
- The purpose of "kee %s" (possible typo/placeholder?)
- Why the print was added/removed
- Project-specific error handling conventions  

I cannot determine which change better serves the semantic intent. The safest approach is to retain the conflict for manual resolution.
