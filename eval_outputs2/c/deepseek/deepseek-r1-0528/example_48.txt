```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. Both conflicts represent version control identifiers (`$Id$`), which are automatically generated metadata tracking file revisions
2. The branch version (`1.10.4.90 2003/12/07`) is more recent than the HEAD version (`1.17 2003/08/24`) based on the commit date
3. Version identifiers are typically updated to reflect the latest modification timestamp during merges
4. Preserving the newer version maintains accurate chronological metadata while satisfying both intents (version tracking)
5. The spacing and comment structure remain consistent with the original context
