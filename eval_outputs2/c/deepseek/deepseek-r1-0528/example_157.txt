The conflict centers around whether to include an `open = 1;` statement when handling `FD_CLOSE`. After analyzing both sides:

1. **HEAD version** sets `open = 1` immediately before reading socket data
2. **Other branch** removes this assignment entirely

Given the context of `FD_CLOSE` handling (socket closure sequence), setting `open = 1` appears semantically incorrect. The socket is being closed, so marking it as "open" contradicts the operation's intent. The other branch's removal aligns with proper close handling semantics.

Resolved version:
```c
    if (bufsize_after < bufsize_before)
      plug_sent(s->plug, bufsize_after);
  } break;
  case FD_CLOSE:
    /* Signal a close on the socket. First read any outstanding data. */
    do {
      ret = p_recv(s->s, buf, sizeof(buf), 0);
      if (ret < 0) {
        err = p_WSAGetLastError();
        if (err == WSAEWOULDBLOCK)
```
