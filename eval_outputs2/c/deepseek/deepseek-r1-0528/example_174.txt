  const struct plug_function_table *fn;
  /* the above variable absolutely *must* be the first in this structure */
```

**Reasoning:**  
This conflict shows two different macros being used to finish a coroutine (`crFinish(1)` vs `crFinishV`). Since the macros likely have different semantics (one taking an argument, one being void) and we lack context about:  
1. The coroutine implementation details  
2. Function return type expectations  
3. Project-specific macro definitions  

The intent is ambiguous and cannot be safely resolved without deeper understanding of the codebase. The conflict markers are preserved as required.
