            /* Not CONNECT or reserved field nonzero - error */
            reply[1] = 1; /* generic failure */
            sk_write(pf->s, (char *)reply, lenof(reply));
            pfd_close(pf);

```

The conflict cannot be automatically resolved due to fundamental differences in function flow:
1. The HEAD version returns an integer value (`return 1;`) suggesting the function has a non-void return type where this value might indicate error status
2. The other branch returns nothing (`return;`) suggesting either:
   - The function return type is void
   - The control flow should simply exit at this point without returning a value

Without seeing the function signature or understanding the broader context of error handling, this represents a semantic conflict that requires manual resolution. The surrounding context doesn't provide enough information to determine which version is correct.
