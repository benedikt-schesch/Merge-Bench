Based on the provided code snippet with merge conflict markers, I've analyzed the semantic intent of both branches. The conflict occurs around setting the `connopen` flag. The HEAD branch adds this flag assignment while the other branch does not include it.

After examining the surrounding context:
- The code appears to be handling connection setup
- The `connopen` flag likely tracks connection state
- Both versions immediately proceed to get standard I/O handles
- There's no additional context about why the flag was added/removed

Since the intent is ambiguous without more context about:
1. Why HEAD added this state flag
2. Why the other branch removed it
3. How the `connopen` flag is used elsewhere

I'm returning the original code with conflict markers preserved as instructed:

```c
      return 1;
    }
    back->provide_logctx(backhandle, logctx);
    sfree(realhost);
  }
<<<<<<< HEAD
  connopen = 1;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5

  inhandle = GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE);
  outhandle = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
  errhandle = GetStdHandle(STD_ERROR_HANDLE);
