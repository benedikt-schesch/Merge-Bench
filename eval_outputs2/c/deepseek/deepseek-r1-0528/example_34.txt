```c
				subnet_del(n, s);
			}

			for(enode = n->edge_tree->head; enode; enode = enext) {
				enext = enode->next;
				e = (edge_t *) enode->data;
				if(!tunnelserver)
					send_del_edge(broadcast, e);
				edge_del(e);
			}
		}
	}


```

The conflict is resolved by:
1. Keeping the type cast from HEAD `(edge_t *)` for type safety
2. Preserving the conditional `send_del_edge()` from the feature branch
3. Maintaining the `edge_del(e)` call that both branches agree on

This combines both semantic intentions:
- Type safety improvement from HEAD
- Conditional message sending logic from the feature branch
- The deletion logic remains unchanged

The resolution ensures:
- The cast is preserved for correct type handling
- Broadcast only happens when `!tunnelserver`
- Edge deletion always occurs regardless of tunnel status
- Original spacing/formatting is maintained
