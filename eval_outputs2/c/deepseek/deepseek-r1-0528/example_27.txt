The merge conflict involves a difference in type casting for the node data assignment. The HEAD version uses an explicit cast to `(connection_t *)` while the other branch does not use a cast. Since the code later accesses `c->last_ping_time`, it's clear that `c` must be of type `connection_t *`. 

The resolution depends on the underlying type of `node->data`:
1. If `node->data` is already `connection_t *` (e.g., due to a type change in one branch), the cast is redundant
2. If `node->data` remains a generic pointer (like `void *`), the cast is necessary

Without additional context about the type definition of `node->data`, this conflict is **semantically ambiguous**. Both versions could be correct depending on type changes in either branch. Therefore, the conflict markers should be preserved.

Resolved output (with conflict intact):
```c

	cp();

	for(node = connection_tree->head; node; node = next) {
		next = node->next;
<<<<<<< HEAD
		c = (connection_t *) node->data;
=======
		c = node->data;

		if(c->last_ping_time + pingtimeout < now) {
			if(c->status.active) {
				if(c->status.pinged) {
					ifdebug(CONNECTIONS) logger(LOG_INFO, _("%s (%s) didn't respond to PING"),
