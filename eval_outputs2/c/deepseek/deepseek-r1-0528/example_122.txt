The conflict arises from formatting differences and a cast addition in the printf statement. Both versions intend to print the same error message, but the secondary branch adds an explicit cast to `unsigned` for the `l` variable to ensure proper formatting with `%08x`. This is semantically important since `%08x` expects an unsigned integer. The multi-line formatting improves readability.

Here's the resolved code preserving context:

```c
      printf("%d: correct string shorter than output\n", line);
      total_errs++;
      break;
    }
    if (l != str[i]) {
      printf("%d: char %d came out as %08x, should be %08x\n",
             line,
             i,
             str[i],
             (unsigned)l);
      total_errs++;
    }
  }
  if (l != -1) {
    l = va_arg(ap, long int);
```
