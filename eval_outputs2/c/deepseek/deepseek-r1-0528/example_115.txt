I've analyzed the provided merge conflict, but the intent behind the two conflicting changes (`crFinish(1)` vs `crFinishV`) is ambiguous without additional context about the coroutine implementation and the expected behavior. Since I cannot determine the semantic intent with certainty, I'm returning the original snippet with the conflict markers preserved as requested.

```c
    share_got_pkt_from_downstream(
        cs, cs->recvbuf[4], cs->recvbuf + 5, cs->recvlen - 5);
  }

dead:;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  crFinish(1);

}

static void share_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  /* struct ssh_sharing_connstate *cs = (struct ssh_sharing_connstate *)plug; */
```
