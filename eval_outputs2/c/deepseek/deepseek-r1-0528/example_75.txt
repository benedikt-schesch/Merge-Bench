The conflict involves a comment spelling correction. Both sides intend to prevent resizing when the window is maximized, but the branch fixes a typo ("supress" â†’ "suppress"). The resolution adopts the corrected spelling while preserving identical functionality.

Resolved code:
```c

void request_resize(void *frontend, int w, int h)
{
  int width, height;

  /* If the window is maximized suppress resizing attempts */
  if (IsZoomed(hwnd)) {
    if (conf_get_int(conf, CONF_resize_action) == RESIZE_TERM)
      return;
  }


```
