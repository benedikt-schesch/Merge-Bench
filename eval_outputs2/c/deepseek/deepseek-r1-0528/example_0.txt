The merge conflict involves the declaration of `countSize`, which is present in the HEAD branch but absent in the other branch. Since the variable `countSize` is not used in the immediate context and the surrounding logic relies on `workSpace` allocations, the declaration appears redundant. Both branches agree on the subsequent logic, so the conflict can be resolved by omitting the `countSize` declaration.

Resolved code:
```c
                                HIST_checkInput_e check,
                                U32* const workSpace)
{
    const BYTE* ip = (const BYTE*)source;
    const BYTE* const iend = ip+sourceSize;
    unsigned max=0;
    U32* const Counting1 = workSpace;
    U32* const Counting2 = Counting1 + 256;
    U32* const Counting3 = Counting2 + 256;
    U32* const Counting4 = Counting3 + 256;

```
