The merge conflict occurs around a return statement at the end of a function. Since the function's return type isn't visible in the snippet, the intent is ambiguous. The HEAD branch returns `1` at this position, while the other branch has no return statement. Without knowing whether the function should return a value, it's unsafe to resolve automatically.

Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```c
      rlogin->firstbyte = 0;
    }
    if (len > 0)
      c_write(rlogin, data, len);
  }
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return 1;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

static void rlogin_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  Rlogin rlogin = (Rlogin)plug;
```
