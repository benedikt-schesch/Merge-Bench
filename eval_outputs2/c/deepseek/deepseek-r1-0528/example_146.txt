Based on the semantic analysis of both changes, the resolution maintains the explicit type casting for `sprintf` arguments while preserving the multi-line formatting for readability. Here's the resolved snippet:

```c
        blen = alen = 0;
      } else {
        multilen = WideCharToMultiByte(
            CP_ACP, 0, unitab + uindex, 1, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL);
        if (multilen != 1) {
          blen = sprintf(
              before, "{\\uc%d\\u%d", (int)multilen, (int)udata[uindex]);
          alen = 1;
          strcpy(after, "}");
        } else {
          blen = sprintf(before, "\\u%d", udata[uindex]);
          alen = 0;
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Both versions agree on the core functionality - formatting Unicode escape sequences
2. The casting to `(int)` explicitly ensures type safety for `%d` format specifier
3. The multi-line formatting improves code readability without changing behavior
4. The surrounding context remains unchanged as per requirements

The resolution maintains compiler compatibility (preventing potential warnings) while keeping the semantic intent of both branches.
