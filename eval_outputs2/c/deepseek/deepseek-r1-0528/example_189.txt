The merge conflict involves a conditional block added in one branch that doesn't exist in the other. Since the conditional block references `advance_func.gpio_init_post` which isn't present in the surrounding context, its intent and necessity are ambiguous. Without additional context about `advance_func` or how these branches relate to the overall codebase, it's impossible to determine if this is a required error check or conflicting functionality. 

The conflict is preserved exactly as provided since the semantic intent can't be confidently resolved:

```c
        }
        dev->owner = 1;
        close(export);
    }
