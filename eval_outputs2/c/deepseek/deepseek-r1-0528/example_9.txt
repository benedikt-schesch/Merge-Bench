I'll help resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intent of both changes while preserving the surrounding context exactly as provided.

```c
#include "bezier_curve.h"
#include "../common/scene_curves.h"

/*

<<<<<<< HEAD
  Implements Catmul Rom curves with control points p0, p1, p2, p3. At
  t=0 the curve goes through p1, with tangent (p2-p0)/2, and for t=1
=======
  Implements Catmull-Rom curves with control points p0, p1, p2, p3. At
  t=0 the curve goes through p1, with tangent (p2-p0)/3, and for t=1
  the curve goes through p2 with tangent (p3-p2)/2.

### Analysis:
1. **Spelling correction** (from "Catmul Rom" to "Catmull-Rom") is objectively correct and should be kept
2. **Tangent values** show conflicting technical specifications:
   - HEAD uses `/2` for tangent at t=0
   - Other branch uses `/3` for t=0 and `/2` for t=1
3. **Completion of thought**: The other branch completes the t=1 description

### Resolution:
This conflict cannot be automatically resolved because:
- The tangent values are mathematically significant and inconsistent
- Without implementation context, I can't determine which tangent values are correct
- Both changes modify overlapping lines with conflicting technical specifications

### Recommendation:
A human developer should:
1. Verify the correct tangent calculations in the implementation
2. Choose between:
   - Standard Catmull-Rom formula (usually uses 0.5 tension â†’ `/2`)
   - Custom implementation (might need `/3`)
3. Complete the sentence for t=1 regardless of chosen version

The conflict remains unresolved due to technical ambiguity in the specification.
