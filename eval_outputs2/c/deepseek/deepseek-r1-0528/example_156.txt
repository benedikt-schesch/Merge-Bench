The merge conflict presents two different approaches for handling the `plug_receive` call in the `else` branch. The HEAD version uses a `return` statement, which would exit the function immediately, while the other branch calls the function without returning. This creates a control flow discrepancy since the subsequent `break` statement would be unreachable in the HEAD version.

Given the ambiguity in function-wide control flow requirements and without additional context about the function's return type or overall logic, it's unsafe to automatically resolve this conflict. The decision depends on whether the function should exit immediately after `plug_receive` or continue processing.

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```c
      /* We're inside the Windows frontend here, so we know
       * that the frontend handle is unnecessary. */
      logevent(NULL, str);
      fatalbox("%s", str);
    } else {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      return plug_receive(s->plug, 2, buf, ret);
=======
      plug_receive(s->plug, 2, buf, ret);
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
    }
    break;
  case FD_WRITE: {
    int bufsize_before, bufsize_after;
    s->writable = 1;
```
