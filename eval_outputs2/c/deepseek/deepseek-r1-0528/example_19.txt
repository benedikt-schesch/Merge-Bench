The conflict occurs in the `getopt_long` option string where HEAD adds a `u:` option while the other branch removes it. Since the context doesn't show the corresponding case handler for `'u'` and the intent is ambiguous, I cannot safely resolve this conflict. Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```c
        { "xcode", required_argument, NULL, 'x' },
        { NULL, 0, NULL, 0 },
    };
    char ch;

<<<<<<< HEAD
    while ((ch = getopt_long(argc, argv, "dvi:b:a:t:u:x:", longopts, NULL)) != -1)
=======
    while ((ch = getopt_long(argc, argv, "dvi:b:a:t:x:", longopts, NULL)) != -1)
>>>>>>> 05f934d5013ca01de31ec6e500551c233ed71593
    {
        switch (ch) {
        case 'd':
            debug = 1;
            break;

``` 

Resolution requires checking:
1. If `case 'u'` exists elsewhere in the code (HEAD adds new functionality)
2. If `u:` was intentionally removed in the other branch (refactoring/deprecation)
3. Whether both options need to coexist (combine into `"dvi:b:a:t:u:x:"`)

Without seeing the full context for `'u'` handling, manual resolution is required.
