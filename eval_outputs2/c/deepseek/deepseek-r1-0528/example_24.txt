I'll help resolve this merge conflict while preserving the context exactly. The conflict involves two different version identifiers in a comment block. Since version identifiers are typically generated by version control systems and don't affect code functionality, but we need to choose one to resolve the conflict.

Looking at the two options:
1. HEAD: `$Id: conf.c,v 1.14 2003/08/24 20:38:24 guus Exp $`
2. Other branch: `$Id: conf.c,v 1.9.4.77 2003/12/12 19:52:24 guus Exp $`

The version from the other branch (1.9.4.77) appears to be a more recent version based on both the version number and date (December 2003 vs August 2003). Since it's a comment that doesn't affect code execution, we'll keep the more recent version identifier.

Here's the resolved code with full context preserved:
