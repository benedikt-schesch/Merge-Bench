The conflict arises from differences in header includes between the branches. The intent appears to be:
1. The base code conditionally includes `php_logos.h` for older engines
2. The incoming branch adds essential PHP includes (`php.h`, `php_ini.h`)
3. The incoming branch also adds version-specific `php_logos.h` inclusion for PHP < 5.5.0
4. Both branches need the subsequent includes (`fopen_wrappers.h`, etc.)

The resolution maintains all necessary includes while preserving both conditional behaviors. The version check for `php_logos.h` is kept since it might be needed for environments where `ZEND_ENGINE_2_5` isn't defined but PHP_VERSION_ID is available.

Resolved version:
```c

#ifndef ZEND_ENGINE_2_5
#include "php_logos.h"
#endif

#include "php.h"
#include "php_ini.h"
#if PHP_VERSION_ID < 50500
   #include "php_logos.h"
#endif
#include "main/fopen_wrappers.h"
#include "ext/standard/info.h"
#include "ext/standard/php_incomplete_class.h"
#include "ext/standard/md5.h"
