The merge conflict involves a `return 1;` statement that exists in the HEAD branch but is missing in the other branch (4348393f). Since the function's return type and semantics are not visible in the provided context, it's ambiguous whether the return statement is required for correct program behavior. Without knowing the function's signature or the intent behind both changes, it's unsafe to automatically resolve this conflict.

Here's the unchanged code with conflict markers:

```c
  Raw raw = (Raw)plug;
  c_write(raw, data, len);
  /* We count 'session start', for proxy logging purposes, as being
   * when data is received from the network and printed. */
  raw->session_started = TRUE;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return 1;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

static void raw_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  Raw raw = (Raw)plug;
```
