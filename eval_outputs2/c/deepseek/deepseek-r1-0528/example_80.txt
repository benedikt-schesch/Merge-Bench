Based on the semantic analysis, both declarations are independent Windows API imports that should be preserved. The conflict is resolved by keeping both function declarations in their original formats:

```c
                      (PCtxtHandle, ULONG, PVOID));
DECL_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(static,
                      SECURITY_STATUS,
                      MakeSignature,
                      (PCtxtHandle, ULONG, PSecBufferDesc, ULONG));
DECL_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(static, DLL_DIRECTORY_COOKIE, AddDllDirectory, (PCWSTR));

typedef struct winSsh_gss_ctx {
  unsigned long maj_stat;
  unsigned long min_stat;
  CredHandle cred_handle;
```

Key resolution points:
1. `MakeSignature` declaration (multi-line format) is preserved from HEAD
2. `AddDllDirectory` declaration (single-line format) is preserved from other branch
3. Both declarations are complementary Windows API imports
4. Original spacing/formatting is maintained for both declarations
5. Struct definition remains unchanged as common context

The declarations serve different purposes:
- `MakeSignature` handles cryptographic operations
- `AddDllDirectory` manages DLL search paths
Both are required for complete functionality.
