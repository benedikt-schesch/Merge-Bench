Based on the provided code snippet, I notice the conflict revolves around how the linked list data is being accessed. The conflict appears ambiguous because:

1. The HEAD version uses an explicit cast `(edge_t *)` while the other branch does not
2. Without knowing the exact type definitions of `edge_weight_tree` and its nodes, I cannot determine if the cast is necessary or redundant
3. Both versions seem functionally identical in intent (accessing edge data from a linked list node)

Since the semantic intent is unclear without additional context about the data types, I'm returning the original conflicted snippet as instructed:

```c
>>>>>>> af86a3226ea42375644b3f99c182c778d327de1e

		if(!n->status.reachable) {
			for(enode = edge_weight_tree->head; enode; enode = enext) {
				enext = enode->next;
<<<<<<< HEAD
				e = (edge_t *) enode->data;
=======
				e = enode->data;
>>>>>>> af86a3226ea42375644b3f99c182c778d327de1e

				if(e->to == n)
					break;
			}
