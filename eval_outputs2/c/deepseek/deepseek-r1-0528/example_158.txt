I'll resolve this merge conflict by selecting the HTTPS URL since it's the more secure and updated version, which aligns with modern web standards. Here's the resolved snippet:

```c
      return 0;
    case 102:
      /* Load web browser */
      ShellExecute(hwnd,
                   "open",
                   "https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/",
                   0,
                   0,
                   SW_SHOWDEFAULT);
      return 0;
    }
```

Key points in this resolution:
1. Both sides share identical intent - loading the PuTTY website
2. HTTPS provides encryption and security benefits over HTTP
3. The domain and path are identical in both versions
4. Modern browsers often force HTTPS upgrades anyway
5. Preserves all surrounding context and formatting exactly as provided

The conflict was semantic rather than functional - both URLs would work, but HTTPS is clearly the better choice for security reasons.
