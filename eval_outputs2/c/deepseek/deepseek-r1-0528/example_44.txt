The conflict arises from the addition of a global variable declaration in one branch while the other branch doesn't have it. Since this is a new variable declaration and doesn't conflict with existing declarations in the context, it can be safely added. The variable `tunnelserver` appears to be a new global flag added in the feature branch, likely for controlling tunnel server behavior.

Resolved code:
```c
#include "meta.h"
#include "protocol.h"
#include "utils.h"
#include "xalloc.h"

bool tunnelserver = false;

/* Jumptable for the request handlers */

static bool (*request_handlers[])(connection_t *) = {
		id_h, metakey_h, challenge_h, chal_reply_h, ack_h,
		status_h, error_h, termreq_h,
```
