The conflict arises from one branch adding a post-write hook while the other branch doesn't. The hook (`gpio_mmaped_write_post`) should be called after modifying the register but before returning success, as it extends functionality without breaking existing behavior when the hook is unset. Here's the resolved version:

```c
        *((unsigned *)dev->reg) |= (1<<dev->reg_bit_pos);
        return MRAA_SUCCESS;
    }
    *((unsigned *)dev->reg) &= ~(1<<dev->reg_bit_pos);

    if (advance_func.gpio_mmaped_write_post != NULL)
        return advance_func.gpio_mmaped_write_post(dev,value);
    return MRAA_SUCCESS;
}

static mraa_result_t
mraa_gpio_wait_interrupt(int fd)
```

Key resolution points:
1. The `gpio_mmaped_write_post` hook is preserved from the feature branch
2. It's safely guarded by a NULL check
3. When the hook exists, its return value propagates
4. When no hook exists, `MRAA_SUCCESS` returns normally
5. Original spacing/indentation is preserved

The solution maintains both:
- The original success return behavior (when no hook exists)
- The new extended functionality (when hook is configured)
