The conflict is a simple spelling correction in a comment. The change from "doesnt" to "doesn't" improves grammatical correctness without altering the meaning. The resolved code maintains consistency with the surrounding comments:

```c
};

/* Shaping Types */
enum
{
  SL, /* Left-Joining, doesn't exist in U+0600 - U+06FF */
  SR, /* Right-Joining, ie has Isolated, Final */
  SD, /* Dual-Joining, ie has Isolated, Final, Initial, Medial */
  SU, /* Non-Joining */
  SC  /* Join-Causing, like U+0640 (TATWEEL) */
};

```
