Based on the provided context, the conflict involves a `return 1;` statement that exists in the HEAD branch but is absent in the other branch (4348393f). The surrounding code shows:

1. The conflict occurs right before the function's closing brace `}`
2. The function appears to be non-void (based on the comment about returning error values)
3. The HEAD branch explicitly returns 1 after a switch statement
4. The other branch has no return statement at this location

This creates ambiguity because:
- If the function requires a return value, omitting it (other branch) could cause undefined behavior
- If the function returns void, keeping `return 1;` (HEAD) would break compilation
- Without seeing the function signature or full control flow, we can't determine:
  * If other return paths exist
  * The actual return type
  * Whether 1 is a valid success code

Since the intent is ambiguous and critical information is missing, I'm returning the unresolved conflict:

```c
      if (bufsize_after < bufsize_before)
        plug_sent(s->plug, bufsize_after);
    }
    break;
  }
