The merge conflict involves the presence of a variable declaration `int ret = TRUE;` in the HEAD branch, which is absent in the other branch (4348393f). Since the variable `ret` isn't referenced in the visible code snippet, the intent behind its existence is ambiguous. It might be used later in the function (outside the provided context), or it could be an unnecessary leftover. Without more context about the full function, it's impossible to resolve this conflict safely.

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

void pty_select_result(int fd, int event)
{
<<<<<<< HEAD
  int ret = TRUE;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
  Pty pty;

  if (fd == pty_signal_pipe[0]) {
    pid_t pid;
    int status;

```
