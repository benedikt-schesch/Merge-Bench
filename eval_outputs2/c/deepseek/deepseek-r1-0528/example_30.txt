The conflict arises from a difference in casting when accessing the `event` data from the event tree. The HEAD branch explicitly casts `event_tree->head->data` to `(event_t *)`, while the other branch assigns it directly without a cast. 

After analyzing the semantics:
1. Both branches intend to retrieve an event pointer to call its handler and delete it
2. The subsequent `event->handler(event->data)` usage confirms `event` must be a pointer to a struct with these members
3. In C, explicit casting from `void*` is good practice but not strictly required
4. The direct assignment suggests the data member might already be typed as `event_t*` in the other branch
5. Both approaches are functionally equivalent in standard C

Resolution: Keep the more concise version without the cast, as it's equally valid and reduces redundancy. The context doesn't indicate any type safety issues requiring the explicit cast.

```c

		if(sigalrm) {
			logger(LOG_INFO, _("Flushing event queue"));

			while(event_tree->head) {
				event = event_tree->head->data;
				event->handler(event->data);
				event_del(event);
			}
			sigalrm = false;
		}

```
