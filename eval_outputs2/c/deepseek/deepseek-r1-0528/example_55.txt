Based on the provided code snippet, I'll return the exact content with the conflict markers preserved since the intent behind the changes is ambiguous without more context. Both versions modify the same struct fields in incompatible ways, and it's unclear whether the changes are additive or mutually exclusive.

```c
    }
  }
}

struct ttymodes_data {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  union control *modelist, *valradio, *valbox;
  union control *addbutton, *rembutton, *listbox;
=======
  union control *valradio, *valbox, *setbutton, *listbox;
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
};

static void ttymodes_handler(union control *ctrl,
                             void *dlg,
                             void *data,
``` 

The conflict remains unresolved because:
1. HEAD version includes `modelist`, `addbutton`, and `rembutton` while the other branch adds `setbutton`
2. The purpose of these controls is unclear from the snippet
3. The changes appear mutually exclusive rather than additive
4. Without understanding the dialog's functionality, we can't determine if one set replaces the other or if they should be combined
