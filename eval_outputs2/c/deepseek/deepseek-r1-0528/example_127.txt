The merge conflict cannot be automatically resolved due to ambiguity in the function's return type. Both changes modify the return statement differently (`return 1;` vs `return;`), which implies potential differences in the function signature (int vs void). Since the function declaration isn't visible in the snippet, I'm preserving the conflict for manual resolution.

```c
  u_long atmark;

  /* Find the Socket structure */
  s = find234(sktree, &fd, cmpforsearch);
  if (!s)
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return 1; /* boggle */
=======
    return; /* boggle */
