The conflict arises from one branch adding a new global variable declaration `mraa_adv_func advance_func;` after the `platform_type` definition, while the other branch makes no changes in this location. Since these changes are additive and non-conflicting in intent, we can safely include both lines while preserving semantics.

Resolved code:
```c
#include "version.h"

//static mraa_pininfo_t* pindata;
static mraa_board_t* plat = NULL;
static mraa_platform_t platform_type = MRAA_UNKNOWN_PLATFORM;
mraa_adv_func advance_func;

const char *
mraa_get_version()
{
    return gVERSION;
```

Resolution reasoning:
1. Both branches agree on `static mraa_platform_t platform_type = MRAA_UNKNOWN_PLATFORM;`
2. The added variable `advance_func` doesn't conflict with existing declarations
3. The variable is likely needed for extended functionality in the merging branch
4. No modification of existing context was made
5. Spacing and comments are preserved exactly as in original context

The resolution maintains compatibility with both branches' intentions while avoiding ambiguous changes. The new variable declaration is included without `static` modifier as originally introduced in the feature branch, preserving its intended linkage.
