```

**Reasoning:**  
The conflict involves two different function calls (`WritePrinter` vs `p_WritePrinter`) with identical parameters and semantics. Since the intent behind the name change is ambiguous (could be refactoring, dynamic linking, or a typo) and there's insufficient context to determine which version should take precedence, the conflict cannot be safely resolved automatically. Preserving both versions in conflict markers is necessary for manual resolution.
