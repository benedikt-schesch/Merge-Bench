The conflict arises from the presence of an inner `#if GTK_CHECK_VERSION(3,0,0)` check inside a function that's already conditionally compiled for GTK 3.0.0+. The HEAD version includes a comment explaining the workaround, while the other branch removes the redundant inner check. 

The resolution keeps the explanatory comment while removing the redundant inner `#if` check since the function is already wrapped in an identical version check. This maintains semantic correctness while preserving valuable context.

```c
}

#if GTK_CHECK_VERSION(3, 0, 0)
char *colour_to_css(const GdkColor *col)
{
  /* gdk_window_set_background is deprecated; work around its
   * absence. */
  GdkRGBA rgba;
  rgba.red = col->red / 65535.0;
  rgba.green = col->green / 65535.0;
  rgba.blue = col->blue / 65535.0;
  rgba.alpha = 1.0;
```
