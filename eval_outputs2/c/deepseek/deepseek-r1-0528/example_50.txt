The merge conflict involves the public exponent value used in `RSA_generate_key`. Both values (`0xFFFF` and `0x10001`) are valid public exponents, but they represent different cryptographic choices. Since:

1. There's no additional context about project-specific requirements
2. Both values are semantically valid but functionally distinct
3. The conflict marker references a specific commit (`af86a322...`) indicating intentional divergence

The intent is ambiguous without knowing which exponent the project requires. Therefore, the conflict remains unresolved. Here's the unchanged code snippet:

```c
	FILE *f;
	char *name = NULL;
	char *filename;

	fprintf(stderr, _("Generating %d bits keys:\n"), bits);
<<<<<<< HEAD
	rsa_key = RSA_generate_key(bits, 0xFFFF, indicator, NULL);
=======
	rsa_key = RSA_generate_key(bits, 0x10001, indicator, NULL);
>>>>>>> af86a3226ea42375644b3f99c182c778d327de1e

	if(!rsa_key) {
		fprintf(stderr, _("Error during key generation!\n"));
		return false;
	} else

```
