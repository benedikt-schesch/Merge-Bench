Based on the provided context, this appears to be a version identifier conflict in a header comment. Both branches are updating the same `$Id$` tag with different version information. Since this is purely metadata and doesn't affect code functionality, and we lack semantic context about which version is preferred, I'm returning the unresolved conflict:

#ifndef __TINC_PROTOCOL_H__
#define __TINC_PROTOCOL_H__


```

Rationale:
1. Both changes modify the same line in the header comment
2. The conflict shows two different version numbers and dates
3. Without knowing project versioning conventions or merge direction, we can't determine which version is current
4. The RCS `$Id$` tag is typically auto-updated by version control systems
5. Preserving the conflict allows manual resolution based on external knowledge
