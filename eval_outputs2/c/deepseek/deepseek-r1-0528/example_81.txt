The conflict involves adding a security measure to safely load `sspicli.dll` before calling `GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION`. Both branches agree on loading `secur32.dll` and calling `GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION`, but the incoming branch adds a comment explaining why `sspicli.dll` must be preloaded to avoid unsafe implicit loading. This is a valid security improvement that doesn't conflict with HEAD's logic.

Resolved code:
```c
  {
    static int tried_usernameex = FALSE;
    if (!tried_usernameex) {
      /* Not available on Win9x, so load dynamically */
      HMODULE secur32 = load_system32_dll("secur32.dll");
      /* If MIT Kerberos is installed, the following call to
         GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION makes Windows implicitly load
         sspicli.dll WITHOUT proper path sanitizing, so better
         load it properly before */
      HMODULE sspicli = load_system32_dll("sspicli.dll");
      GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(secur32, GetUserNameExA);
      tried_usernameex = TRUE;
    }
  }
```
