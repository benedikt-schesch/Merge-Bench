The conflict arises from two different ways to describe the mount option `dirsync` and its effect on directory operations. Both sides agree that `dirsync` makes directory operations synchronous (like `mkdir`), but differ in phrasing:

- **HEAD version** uses `=>` to indicate a logical mapping (mount option â†’ behavior)
- **Other branch** uses "caused by" to emphasize causality

After analyzing the semantics:
1. Both describe identical behavior (synchronous directory operations)
2. The arrow `=>` is concise and aligns with comment style
3. No functional difference exists between the two versions

Resolved by keeping the **HEAD version** for its clarity and brevity.

```c
 *
 * If the datasync parameter is non-zero, then only the user data
 * should be flushed, not the meta data
 *
 * Introduced in version 2.3
 * => mount option dirsync, which causes directory operations e.g. mkdir to be synchronous
 */

int sfs_fsyncdir(const char *path, int datasync, struct fuse_file_info *fi) {
	int retstat = 0;
	DIR *dp;
