I've analyzed the merge conflict, which involves different `$Id` tags from two branches. Both versions serve the same semantic purpose - they're version control metadata for tracking file revisions. Since this is purely informational and the actual content is functionally identical, I'll resolve by keeping the HEAD version as it represents the target branch.

#define __TINC_CONF_H__


```

Rationale:
1. Both versions serve identical semantic purposes (version tracking)
2. The HEAD version is preserved as it's the target branch
3. The spacing and surrounding context remain unchanged
4. This resolution maintains consistency with the HEAD branch while preserving all functional aspects of the code
