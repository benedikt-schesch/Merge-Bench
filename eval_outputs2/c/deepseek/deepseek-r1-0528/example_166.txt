Based on analyzing the conflict and surrounding context:

1. The comment explicitly references `select_result()`: "We must not call select_result() for any socket..."
2. This indicates the function is used later in the code
3. The HEAD version properly declares the function prototype
4. The other branch's removal would likely cause compilation errors

Resolved version preserving necessary declaration:

```c
    handle_got_event(handles[n - WAIT_OBJECT_0]);
  } else if (netindex >= 0 && n == WAIT_OBJECT_0 + netindex) {
    WSANETWORKEVENTS things;
    SOCKET socket;
    extern SOCKET first_socket(int *), next_socket(int *);
    extern int select_result(WPARAM, LPARAM);
    int i, socketstate;

    /*
     * We must not call select_result() for any socket
     * until we have finished enumerating within the
```

The resolution keeps the `select_result` declaration since:
- The function is referenced in the comment
- Removing it would break compilation
- Both branches appear to need this function
- The declaration doesn't conflict with other visible code
