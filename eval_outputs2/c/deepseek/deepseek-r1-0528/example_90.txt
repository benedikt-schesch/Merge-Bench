I'll return the code snippet exactly as provided since the intent behind the conflicting surface formats (RGB24 vs ARGB32) is ambiguous without more context. Both formats serve different purposes (opaque vs transparent surfaces), and I can't determine which one is semantically correct without understanding the application's requirements.

```c
      cairo_surface_destroy(inst->surface);
      inst->surface = NULL;
    }

    inst->surface =

        cairo_image_surface_create(CAIRO_FORMAT_RGB24, backing_w, backing_h);

        cairo_image_surface_create(CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32, backing_w, backing_h);

  draw_backing_rect(inst);
