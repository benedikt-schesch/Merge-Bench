The conflict arises from differing definitions of `AF_UNKNOWN`. The HEAD branch uses `0xFFFF` (a 16-bit value), while the other branch uses `255` (an 8-bit value). Given that `family` in `sockaddr_unknown` is defined as `uint16_t`, the 16-bit `0xFFFF` is more semantically appropriate for an "unknown" constant in a 16-bit field. This value aligns with common conventions for maximum-value sentinels in network programming.

Resolved version:
```c
	uint16_t x[8];
} ipv6_t;

typedef short length_t;

#define AF_UNKNOWN 0xFFFF

struct sockaddr_unknown {
	uint16_t family;
	uint16_t pad1;
	uint32_t pad2;
```
