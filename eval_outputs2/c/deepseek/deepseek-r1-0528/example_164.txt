The merge conflict involves a difference in how the `select_result` function call is handled. In the HEAD version, the return value of `select_result` is used to update `connopen` via bitwise AND assignment (`&=`), indicating the state of the connection is being tracked. In the other branch, the return value is ignored. 

Since the intent behind these changes is unclear and the usage of `connopen` isn't visible in the surrounding context, this conflict requires manual resolution. Here's the preserved snippet with the conflict:

```c
          for (e = 0; e < lenof(eventtypes); e++)
            if (things.lNetworkEvents & eventtypes[e].mask) {
              LPARAM lp;
              int err = things.iErrorCode[eventtypes[e].bit];
              lp = WSAMAKESELECTREPLY(eventtypes[e].mask, err);
<<<<<<< HEAD
              connopen &= select_result(wp, lp);
=======
              select_result(wp, lp);
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
            }
        }
      }
    } else if (n == WAIT_OBJECT_0 + nhandles + 1) {
      MSG msg;

```
