The conflict centers around the condition for unthrottling the backend. The HEAD branch adds an extra `connopen` check alongside the existing `back->connected()` call, while the other branch retains only the `back->connected()` check. Since there's no additional context about the purpose of `connopen` or whether it's still relevant in the other branch, the intent is ambiguous. 

Both changes modify the same logical condition, and without knowing if `connopen` is:
1. A necessary safeguard added in HEAD
2. A redundant variable removed in the other branch
3. Mutually exclusive with the other branch's changes

...it's unsafe to automatically resolve. The conflict is preserved for manual resolution.

    cleanup_exit(0);
