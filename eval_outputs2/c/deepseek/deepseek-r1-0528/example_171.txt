Based on the semantic context, both branches are trying to properly initialize a queue structure (`qhead`), but they do it differently:

1. The HEAD branch initializes `qhead->first_node` through a loop
2. The other branch adds explicit initialization for `qhead->prefixlen`

The resolution combines both initialization steps since they initialize different fields and are semantically compatible:

```c
  if (!qhead) {
    fprintf(stderr, "out of memory\n");
    exit(1);
  }
  qhead->prefixlen = 0;
  for (e = environ; *e; e++)
    qhead->first_node = new_node(qhead->first_node, *e, strcspn(*e, "="));

  qtail = qhead;
  while (1) {
```

Key reasoning:
1. Memory check (`if (!qhead)`) is common to both
2. `prefixlen` initialization is safe to include before the loop
3. The loop initializes `first_node` (preserved from HEAD)
4. Both initializations are necessary for different fields
5. No semantic overlap exists between the two initializations

Here's the resolved code with full context:

```c
  if (!qhead) {
    fprintf(stderr, "out of memory\n");
    exit(1);
  }
  qhead->prefixlen = 0;
  for (e = environ; *e; e++)
    qhead->first_node = new_node(qhead->first_node, *e, strcspn(*e, "="));

  qtail = qhead;
  while (1) {
```
