The conflict arises from a variable declaration placement. Both branches intend to parse IV data, but one branch declares the variable `j` inside the loop for better scoping. The resolution preserves this improvement while maintaining functionality.

Resolved code:
```c
          errmsg = "unsupported cipher";
          goto error;
        }
        p = strchr(p, ',') + 1; /* always non-NULL, by above checks */
        for (i = 0; i < ivlen; i++) {
          unsigned j;
          if (1 != sscanf(p, "%2x", &j)) {
            errmsg = "expected more iv data in DEK-Info";
            goto error;
          }
          ret->iv[i] = j;
```
