The conflict arises from different approaches to iterating over items. Both sides aim to process valid items (`ver > 0`), but differ in:
1. Source of item count (`(child+i)->count` vs `data->count`)
2. Loop/condition formatting

Resolution reasoning:
1. `data->count` is more direct as it's paired with `data->head`
2. Maintain HEAD's brace style for consistency
3. Remove unused count variable from HEAD

Resolved code:
```c
    int i, j;
    for (i=0; i<BUCKET_SIZE; i++)
    {
        Data *data = get_data(child+i);
        Item *it = data->head;
        for (j=0; j < data->count; j++)
        {
            if (it->ver > 0)
            {
                add_item(tree, node, it, key_hash(tree, it), false);
            } // drop deleted items, ver < 0
            it = (Item*)((char*)it + it->length);
        }
        clear(child + i);
```
