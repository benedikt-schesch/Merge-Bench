The merge conflict involves the function signature and implementation of `x11_receive`. The ambiguity arises because: 

1. **HEAD branch** declares `x11_receive` as returning an `int` and includes a `return 0` statement
2. **Other branch** declares it as `void` with an empty body

Without additional context about the function's intended purpose or its usage, it's impossible to determine which version is semantically correct. The return type (`int` vs `void`) and presence/absence of a return statement represent a fundamental conflict in the function's contract.

Here's the original code with conflicts preserved:

```c
                    int port,
                    const char *error_msg,
                    int error_code)
{
}
<<<<<<< HEAD
static int x11_receive(Plug plug, int urgent, char *data, int len)
{
  return 0;
=======
static void x11_receive(Plug plug, int urgent, char *data, int len)
{
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
