Based on the semantic analysis, both sides are attempting to initialize common controls but use different function names. The conflict arises from a naming discrepancy where HEAD uses `InitCommonControls()` while the other branch uses `init_common_controls()`. 

After examining the context:
1. The surrounding code uses lowercase naming conventions (`sk_init`, `set_explicit_app_user_model_id`)
2. The comment references PuTTY, which historically uses `init_common_controls`
3. The standard Windows API is `InitCommonControls()`, but PuTTY typically wraps this in its own function

The resolution uses `init_common_controls()` to maintain:
- Project naming consistency
- Historical PuTTY code patterns
- Semantic intent of the branch commit

Resolved code:
```c
  hwnd = NULL;
  flags = FLAG_VERBOSE | FLAG_INTERACTIVE;

  sk_init();

  init_common_controls();

  /* Set Explicit App User Model Id so that jump lists don't cause
     PuTTY to hang on to removable media. */

  set_explicit_app_user_model_id();

```
