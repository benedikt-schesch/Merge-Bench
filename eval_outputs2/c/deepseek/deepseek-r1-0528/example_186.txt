The conflict involves a commented line in the HEAD branch that was removed in the other branch. Since the line is commented out (`//fuse_opt_add_arg...`), it has no functional impact. Both branches agree on the subsequent syslog line. The safest resolution is to remove the commented line since it's inactive code and the other branch explicitly deleted it.

Resolved snippet:
```c
		if (setuid(state->uid) == -1) {
			syslog(LOG_ERR, "unable to drop privileges to uid %i", state->uid);
			abort();
		}

		syslog(LOG_NOTICE, "Drop privileges to uid=%i, gid=%i\n", state->uid, state->gid);
	}

	if (!state->perm_checks && (getuid() == 0 || geteuid() == 0)) {
		syslog(LOG_ERR, "[main] cannot run as root without --perms");
```
