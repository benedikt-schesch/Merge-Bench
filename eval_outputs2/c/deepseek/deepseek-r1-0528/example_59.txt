I'll resolve this merge conflict by analyzing the intent of both changes while preserving the surrounding context exactly as provided. Here's the resolved snippet:

```c
                                100,
                                HELPCTX(ssh_ttymodes),
                                ttymodes_handler,
                                P(td),
                                P(NULL));
      td->valbox->generic.column = 1;
      ctrl_tabdelay(s, td->setbutton);
    }

    if (!midsession) {
      /*
       * The Connection/SSH/X11 panel.
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. The column value change (2 → 1) appears to be a layout adjustment where both values could be valid, but the newer value (1) from the branch commit is likely more current
2. The button reference change (`addbutton` → `setbutton`) suggests a semantic renaming where `setbutton` is likely the more appropriate/current reference
3. Both changes modify adjacent lines but are semantically related to the same UI component
4. The branch commit's changes appear more recent and intentional (specific button naming vs generic "add")
5. No additional context suggests these changes are mutually exclusive

The resolved version maintains:
- The column adjustment from the branch commit
- The button renaming from the branch commit
- Full surrounding context unchanged
- Original spacing and formatting preserved
