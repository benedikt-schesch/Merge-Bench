I've analyzed the merge conflict in the Catmull-Rom curve implementation. The key semantic issue is determining the correct starting point for the curve segment. Based on standard Catmull-Rom spline behavior where curves are defined between control points v1 and v2 (with v0 and v3 providing tangent information), the branch version returning `v1` is correct.

Here's the resolved code preserving all context and formatting:

```c
      
      __forceinline CatmullRomCurveT(const Vertex& v0, const Vertex& v1, const Vertex& v2, const Vertex& v3)
        : v0(v0), v1(v1), v2(v2), v3(v3) {}

      __forceinline Vertex begin() const {
        return v1;
      }

      __forceinline Vertex end() const {
        return v2;
      }

```

Rationale:
1. The curve segment should logically start at `v1` and end at `v2` (consistent with `end()`)
2. `v0` and `v3` are control points that influence the curve's shape but aren't segment endpoints
3. The branch change (d70beac) correctly implements Catmull-Rom semantics
4. All surrounding context and formatting is preserved exactly as provided
