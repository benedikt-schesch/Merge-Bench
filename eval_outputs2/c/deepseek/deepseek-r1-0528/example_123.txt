Based on the provided code snippet and surrounding context, I've analyzed the semantic merge conflict. The conflict centers around variable declarations in the "DEK-Info" block:

```c
<<<<<<< HEAD
        int i, j, ivlen;
=======
        int i, ivlen;
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
```

### Analysis:
1. **HEAD version** declares three variables: `i`, `j`, and `ivlen`
2. **Other branch** declares only `i` and `ivlen` (omitting `j`)
3. The subsequent code uses `ivlen` but doesn't show any usage of `i` or `j`
4. Without seeing the complete logic of the block, we can't determine if `j` is used later
5. The removal of `j` in the other branch suggests it might be unused, but we can't verify this from the snippet

Since the intent is ambiguous without full context (we don't see the complete block where these variables might be used), I'm returning the original code with conflict markers as instructed.

```c
        }
        p += 2;
        if (!strcmp(p, "ENCRYPTED"))
          ret->encrypted = TRUE;
      } else if (!strcmp(line, "DEK-Info")) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        int i, j, ivlen;
=======
        int i, ivlen;
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5

        if (!strncmp(p, "DES-EDE3-CBC,", 13)) {
          ret->encryption = OP_E_3DES;
          ivlen = 8;
        } else if (!strncmp(p, "AES-128-CBC,", 12)) {
