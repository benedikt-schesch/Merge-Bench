The merge conflict occurs in the logic handling the return value of `pty_real_select_result`. The HEAD branch accumulates results in `ret` using short-circuit evaluation (`ret = ret && ...`), while the other branch calls the function without using its return value. 

This is a semantic conflict because:
1. The HEAD branch preserves error accumulation logic where `ret` tracks combined success/failure
2. The other branch discards the return value entirely
3. The variable `ret` exists in HEAD's context but may be unused in the other branch

Since we can't determine whether:
- The return value should be ignored (other branch)
- The error accumulation is required (HEAD)
- The function's interface changed between branches

The conflict requires manual resolution. Here's the exact output preserving all context:

```c
      pid = waitpid(-1, &status, WNOHANG);

      pty = find234(ptys_by_pid, &pid, pty_find_by_pid);

      if (pty)
<<<<<<< HEAD
        ret = ret && pty_real_select_result(pty, -1, status);
=======
        pty_real_select_result(pty, -1, status);
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
    } while (pid > 0);
  } else {
    pty = find234(ptys_by_fd, &fd, pty_find_by_fd);

    if (pty)

```
