Based on the semantic analysis, the resolution combines the condition from HEAD with the logging improvements from the other branch. Here's the resolved snippet:

```c
                                gf_log ("glusterfs-fuse", GF_LOG_ERROR,
                                        "SETLK not supported. loading "
                                        "'features/posix-locks' on server side "
                                        "will add SETLK support.");
                        }
                } else  if (op_errno != EAGAIN) {
                        gf_log ("glusterfs-fuse", GF_LOG_WARNING,
                                "%"PRIu64": ERR => -1 (%s)",
                                frame->root->unique, strerror (op_errno));
                }

                send_fuse_err (this, state->finh, op_errno);
        }

```

Key resolution points:
1. Kept the `op_errno != EAGAIN` condition from HEAD to avoid logging transient errors
2. Adopted the `GF_LOG_WARNING` level from the other branch since these are recoverable errors
3. Used `PRIu64` format specifier from the other branch as it matches the unsigned type of `frame->root->unique`
4. Preserved all spacing and context exactly as in the original

The solution maintains the intent of both branches: suppressing EAGAIN log noise while improving logging consistency for other errors.
