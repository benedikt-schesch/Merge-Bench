I've analyzed the semantic merge conflict regarding destroying elements when resizing a container. Both approaches aim to destroy elements beyond the new active size, but use different methods:

1. The HEAD version uses `std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy()` which is the modern, allocator-aware approach
2. The other branch uses direct destructor calls `items[i].~T()` which is less generic

The allocator-traits approach is preferred as it properly handles custom allocators. I've resolved the conflict by keeping the HEAD version while maintaining the exact context and spacing.

```c
        assert(new_active <= new_alloced); 

        /* destroy elements */
        if (new_active < size_active) 
        {
          for (size_t i=new_active; i<size_active; i++)
            std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy(alloc, &items[i]);
          size_active = new_active;
        }

        /* only reallocate if necessary */
        if (new_alloced == size_alloced) {
```
