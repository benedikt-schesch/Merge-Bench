Here's the resolved snippet with the conflict resolved by choosing the more secure HTTPS URL:

```c
      return 0;
    case 102:
      /* Load web browser */
      ShellExecute(hwnd,
                   "open",
                   "https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/",
                   0,
                   0,
                   SW_SHOWDEFAULT);
      return 0;
    }

```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. Both sides intend to open the same PuTTY website
2. The HTTPS version provides encrypted communication (security upgrade)
3. Modern websites should support HTTPS
4. The context remains unchanged as requested
5. The chosen URL matches the branch commit's intent (4348393f...) while maintaining functionality

Note: The resolution assumes the website supports HTTPS. If the site only supports HTTP, the conflict would need to be revisited.
