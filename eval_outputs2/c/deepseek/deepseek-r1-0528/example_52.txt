The conflict arises from one branch adding a new configuration directive `cache_purge_response_type` while the other branch doesn't include this change. Since the added directive doesn't conflict with any other changes and appears to be a valid addition to the configuration array, the resolution keeps the new directive while maintaining proper array formatting.

Resolved code:
```c
        0,
        NULL
    },
# endif /* NGX_HTTP_UWSGI */

    { ngx_string("cache_purge_response_type"),
      NGX_HTTP_MAIN_CONF|NGX_HTTP_SRV_CONF|NGX_HTTP_LOC_CONF|NGX_CONF_TAKE1,
      ngx_http_cache_purge_response_type_conf,
      NGX_HTTP_LOC_CONF_OFFSET,
      0,
      NULL },

    ngx_null_command
};

static ngx_http_module_t  ngx_http_cache_purge_module_ctx = {
    NULL,                                  /* preconfiguration */
```
