I've analyzed the merge conflict and found the intent ambiguous. The conflict revolves around whether a `return 0;` statement should be present at the end of the function. Since the function's return type isn't visible in the provided context, I can't determine if:

1. The function should return a value (making the return statement necessary)
2. The function is void (making the return statement invalid)
3. `connection_fatal()` terminates execution (making the return unreachable)

Without seeing the function signature or understanding the full control flow, I'm preserving the conflict markers as instructed.

Here's the unchanged code snippet with conflict markers:

```c

  if (error_msg)
    logevent(error_msg);
  if (!ssh->close_expected || !ssh->clean_exit)
    connection_fatal(ssh->frontend, "%s", error_msg);
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return 0;

}

static void ssh_receive(Plug plug, int urgent, char *data, int len)
{
  Ssh ssh = (Ssh)plug;

```
