The merge conflict involves the presence of a `return 1;` statement after `do_telnet_read()`. Both branches' intent is ambiguous without knowing the function signature (missing from context). Since the function could reasonably be either `void` (no return needed) or `int` (return required), this cannot be safely resolved automatically. The conflict is preserved.

```c
  Telnet telnet = (Telnet)plug;
  if (urgent)
    telnet->in_synch = TRUE;
  telnet->session_started = TRUE;
  do_telnet_read(telnet, data, len);

static void telnet_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  Telnet telnet = (Telnet)plug;

```
