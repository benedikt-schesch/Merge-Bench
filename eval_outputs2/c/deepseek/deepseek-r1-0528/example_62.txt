The merge conflict occurs in the handling of the `else` branch after processing `val`. The HEAD version unconditionally calls `do_mode` with `val + 1`, while the other branch adds a conditional check for `'V'` and includes a comment about future cases. 

The semantic resolution keeps the safer approach from the other branch that:
1. Checks if `val` starts with `'V'` before skipping it
2. Adds a comment explaining other cases (`'N'`/future values) are ignored
3. Maintains the code structure with braces for clarity

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```c
      val = get_ttymode(ssh->frontend, mode->mode);
      if (val) {
        do_mode(data, mode, val);
        sfree(val);
      }
    } else if (val[0] == 'V') {
      do_mode(data, mode, val + 1); /* skip the 'V' */
    } /* else 'N', or something from the future we don't understand */
  }
}

static int ssh_channelcmp(void *av, void *bv)
