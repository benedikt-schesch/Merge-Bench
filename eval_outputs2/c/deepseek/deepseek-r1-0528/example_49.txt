The merge conflict arises from both branches adding different include statements at the same location. The semantic intent is straightforward - both headers (`<getopt.h>` and `<pidfile.h>`) are required dependencies. Since they serve different purposes and there are no ordering dependencies indicated, we can safely include both.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```c
#include <openssl/evp.h>

#include <lzo1x.h>

#include <getopt.h>
#include <pidfile.h>

#include "conf.h"
#include "device.h"
#include "logger.h"
#include "net.h"

```

Resolution reasoning:
1. Both headers are independent system includes
2. No functional overlap between the headers
3. Alphabetical order is maintained (`getopt` before `pidfile`)
4. Preserves whitespace and formatting from original context
5. Both dependencies appear necessary for the merged codebase

The conflict is resolved by keeping both includes while maintaining the existing code structure and conventions.
