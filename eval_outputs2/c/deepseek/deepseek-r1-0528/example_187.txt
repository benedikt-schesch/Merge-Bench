The conflict arises from both branches adding code at the same location in `mraa_gpio_init_raw()`. The HEAD branch added a pin validation check, while the other branch added a pre-initialization hook. The hook should run first since its purpose is to intercept/validate before any other checks. The pin check remains necessary for basic validation. 

Resolved code:
```c
}

mraa_gpio_context
mraa_gpio_init_raw(int pin)
{
    if (advance_func.gpio_init_pre != NULL) {
        printf("Actually entering\n");
        if (advance_func.gpio_init_pre(pin) != MRAA_SUCCESS)
            return NULL;
    }
    if (pin < 0)
        return NULL;

    char bu[MAX_SIZE];
    int length;
```
