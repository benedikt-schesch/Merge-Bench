The merge conflict arises from a difference in control flow between the branches. The HEAD branch returns directly after setting `state->rootdir_len`, while the other branch adds a `break` statement after the return. Since `return 0` exits the function immediately, the `break` statement is unreachable code. The correct resolution is to keep the HEAD version without the unreachable `break`.

Resolved code:
```c
					return -1;
				}
				state->rootdir_len = state->rootdir ? strlen(state->rootdir) : -1;
				return 0;
			}
	}

	return 1;
}
```
