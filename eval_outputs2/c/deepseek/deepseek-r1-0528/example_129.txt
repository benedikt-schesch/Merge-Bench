I've analyzed the merge conflict, and it presents a semantic ambiguity that requires deeper context to resolve safely. The key issue is the difference in control flow between the two versions:

1. The HEAD version uses `return plug_receive(...)`, which exits the function immediately
2. The other branch uses `plug_receive(...)` without return, allowing execution to continue to the `break` statement

Without knowing:
- The return type of the containing function
- Whether `plug_receive()` returns a value
- The expected control flow after this operation
- What happens after the switch statement

I cannot determine which version is correct or if they can be safely combined. Here's the original code with conflict markers preserved:

```c
       */
      if (s->addr) {
        sk_addr_free(s->addr);
        s->addr = NULL;
      }
<<<<<<< HEAD
      return plug_receive(s->plug, atmark ? 0 : 1, buf, ret);
=======
      plug_receive(s->plug, atmark ? 0 : 1, buf, ret);
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
    }
    break;
  case 2: /* writable */
    if (!s->connected) {
      /*

```

This conflict requires human review to determine:
1. Should the function exit immediately after `plug_receive()`?
2. Is the return value of `plug_receive()` meaningful?
3. Does the control flow need to reach the `break` statement?
4. What is the expected behavior after the switch block?
