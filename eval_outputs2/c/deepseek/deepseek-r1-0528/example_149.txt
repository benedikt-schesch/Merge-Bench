Based on the provided context, the conflict arises from different handling of the `plug_receive()` return value. The resolution focuses on semantic intent while preserving functionality:

1. The `new_backlog` variable assignment appears unused in the provided context
2. Both branches agree on the core logic sequence:
   - Set `defer_close` flag
   - Call `plug_receive()`
   - Consume input data
   - Clear `defer_close` flag
   - Handle deferred close if needed

The resolved version keeps the function call without assignment since the return value isn't used in the visible context:

```c
  /*
   * Hand it off to the plug. Be careful of re-entrance - that might
   * have the effect of trying to close this socket.
   */
  ps->defer_close = TRUE;
  plug_receive(ps->plug, 0, data, len);
  bufchain_consume(&ps->inputdata, len);
  ps->defer_close = FALSE;
  if (ps->deferred_close) {
    sk_handle_close(ps);
    return;
```

Rationale:
- The HEAD branch's `new_backlog` assignment appears unnecessary as the variable isn't used in the visible context
- The other branch's version matches the surrounding logic patterns
- Both branches maintain identical control flow after the function call
- Removing unused variables improves code cleanliness
- The core functionality remains unaffected regardless of capturing the return value
