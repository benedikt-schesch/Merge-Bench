The conflict arises from one branch adding a new `TYPECHECK` macro definition while the other branch doesn't modify this section. Since both changes are non-overlapping and semantically independent (one adds a new macro while the other preserves existing code), they can be safely merged by including both changes. The `TYPECHECK` macro is added after the comment block and before the existing `DECL_WINDOWS_FUNCTION` macro.

Here's the resolved snippet preserving all context and spacing:

```c
 *    (However, it can't always be used, as it trips over more complicated
 *    macro trickery such as the WspiapiGetAddrInfo wrapper for getaddrinfo.)
 *
 * (DECL_WINDOWS_FUNCTION works with both these variants.)
 */
#define TYPECHECK(to_check, to_return)                                         \
  (sizeof(to_check) ? to_return : to_return)
#define DECL_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(linkage, rettype, name, params)                  \
  typedef rettype(WINAPI *t_##name) params;                                    \
  linkage t_##name p_##name
#define STR1(x) #x
#define STR(x) STR1(x)
