I'll return the code snippet with the conflict markers intact since the intent is ambiguous. The presence of `connopen` in the HEAD branch suggests an additional connection state check that's missing in the other branch. Without more context about how `connopen` interacts with `back->connected()`, I can't safely resolve this conflict.

Here's the exact code with conflict markers preserved:

```c
    FD_ZERO(&xset);
    maxfd = 0;

    FD_SET_MAX(signalpipe[0], maxfd, rset);

<<<<<<< HEAD
    if (connopen && !sending && back->connected(backhandle) &&
        back->sendok(backhandle) &&
=======
    if (!sending && back->connected(backhandle) && back->sendok(backhandle) &&
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
        back->sendbuffer(backhandle) < MAX_STDIN_BACKLOG) {
      /* If we're OK to send, then try to read from stdin. */
      FD_SET_MAX(STDIN_FILENO, maxfd, rset);
    }


```
