```c
#include <errno.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include "sqlite3/sqlite3.h"

#define DB_VERSION 16
#define PARSER_VERSION 9

enum {
	DB_BEGIN,
	DB_COMMIT,
	DB_ROLLBACK,
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. **DB_VERSION** - The conflicting branch's version `16` is higher than HEAD's `15`, indicating it contains newer database schema changes that should be preserved after merging.

2. **PARSER_VERSION** - HEAD's version `9` is higher than the conflicting branch's `8`, indicating it contains more recent parser improvements that should be retained.

This resolution combines the latest changes from both branches:
- Database schema updates from the conflicting branch (`DB_VERSION 16`)
- Parser improvements from the current branch (`PARSER_VERSION 9`)

The versions are independent of each other, so combining the higher/more recent values from each branch safely incorporates both sets of changes without conflicts.
