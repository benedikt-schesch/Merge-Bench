Based on the semantic analysis, the conflict arises from one branch adding a global variable declaration while the other branch doesn't have it. The variable `buildinfo_gtk_relevant` appears to be build-related metadata. Since this variable isn't referenced in the surrounding context and the GTK version check immediately follows, it's safe to remove the declaration to maintain consistency with the HEAD branch's structure.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```c
char *x_get_default(const char *key)
{
  return NULL;
}

#if !GTK_CHECK_VERSION(3, 0, 0)
/* This front end only works in GTK 3. If that's not what we've got,
 * it's easier to just turn this program into a trivial stub by ifdef
 * in the source than it is to remove it in the makefile edifice. */
int main(int argc, char **argv)
```
