Based on the semantic analysis of both changes:

1. The HEAD version uses `memmove` to safely handle overlapping memory regions and copies `countSize` bytes
2. The other branch uses `memcpy` with a calculated size `(maxSymbolValue+1)*4` for efficiency

The resolution combines both intents:
- Uses `memmove` for safety (from HEAD)
- Uses the calculated size from the other branch for precision
- Preserves the explanatory comment from HEAD

Resolved code:
```c

    {   unsigned maxSymbolValue = 255;
        while (!Counting1[maxSymbolValue]) maxSymbolValue--;
        if (check && maxSymbolValue > *maxSymbolValuePtr) return ERROR(maxSymbolValue_tooSmall);
        *maxSymbolValuePtr = maxSymbolValue;
        memmove(count, Counting1, (maxSymbolValue+1) * 4);   /* in case count & Counting1 are overlapping */
    }
    return (size_t)max;
}

```
