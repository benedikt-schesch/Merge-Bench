Based on the provided context and conflict markers, I'll resolve this by preserving both intents: the functions should be loaded unconditionally except when Coverity static analysis is being performed. Here's the resolved snippet:

```c
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, WSAGetLastError);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, WSAEnumNetworkEvents);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, WSAStartup);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, WSACleanup);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, closesocket);
#ifndef COVERITY
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, ntohl);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, htonl);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, htons);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, ntohs);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(winsock_module, gethostname);
#endif
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. The `HEAD` version wants these functions loaded unconditionally
2. The other branch (4348393) wants to exclude them only during Coverity analysis
3. Wrapping the functions in `#ifndef COVERITY` satisfies both intents:
   - Normal builds get all functions (original HEAD behavior)
   - Coverity builds skip these functions (other branch's requirement)
4. Note: Preserved the apparent typo in `winsock_module` (with 'i') for `ntohl` to maintain exact original formatting
