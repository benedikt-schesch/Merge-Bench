The conflict involves a format specifier discrepancy in `sscanf` for reading time values. Both branches attempt to parse two time values (`mtime` and `atime`) from the buffer, but use different format specifiers:
- HEAD uses `%ld` (signed long)
- The other branch uses `%lu` (unsigned long)

Without knowing the exact type declaration of `act->mtime` and `act->atime`, it's impossible to determine the correct format specifier. This ambiguity requires manual resolution based on the underlying data type in the struct declaration. 

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
      case 'E':
        back->send(backhandle, "", 1);
        act->action = SCP_SINK_ENDDIR;
        return 0;
      case 'T':
<<<<<<< HEAD
        if (sscanf(act->buf, "%ld %*d %ld %*d", &act->mtime, &act->atime) ==
=======
        if (sscanf(act->buf, "%lu %*d %lu %*d", &act->mtime, &act->atime) ==
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
            2) {
          act->settime = 1;
          back->send(backhandle, "", 1);
          continue; /* go round again */
        }
```
