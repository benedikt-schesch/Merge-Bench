The conflict arises because one branch added a new function declaration (`mraa_setup_uart`) while the other branch added C++ extern guards closing (`#ifdef __cplusplus`). Both changes are valid and should be preserved. The function declaration belongs *inside* the extern "C" block for proper C++ compatibility, so the closing guards must come after the new function.

Resolved code:
```c
 * @param pin physical pin to operate on
 * @return out direction to setup. 1 for output 0 for input
 */
mraa_result_t mraa_swap_complex_gpio(int pin, int out);

/** Setup uart muxes to exposes the pins physically.
 *
 * @param index of the uart in the board definition to expose physically
 * @return mraa_result_t of operation
 */
mraa_result_t mraa_setup_uart(int index);

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
