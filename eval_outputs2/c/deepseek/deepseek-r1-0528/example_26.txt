Based on the context, this conflict involves version control metadata (`$Id$`) which doesn't affect functionality. Since both lines serve the same semantic purpose (tracking file versions), we'll retain the most recent version based on the date stamps.

#include "system.h"

#include <openssl/rand.h>

```

Justification:
1. Both conflicts are CVS version tags in comments
2. The second version (`1.35.4.203`) has a more recent date (2003/12/20 vs 2003/08/24)
3. This preserves the most up-to-date version metadata
4. No functional impact - both lines are purely informational
5. The surrounding context remains unchanged as requested
