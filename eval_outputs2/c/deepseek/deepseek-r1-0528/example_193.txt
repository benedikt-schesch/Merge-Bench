The conflict arises between the base code (HEAD) and a branch adding an advanced function call. The intent is to call `advance_func.gpio_dir_post` if available after closing the direction, while preserving the original success return. The resolution implements the hook functionality from the branch while maintaining the base behavior when the hook isn't present.

Resolved code:
```c
        close(direction);
        return MRAA_ERROR_INVALID_RESOURCE;
    }

    close(direction);
    if (advance_func.gpio_dir_post != NULL)
        return advance_func.gpio_dir_post(dev,dir);
    return MRAA_SUCCESS;
}

int
mraa_gpio_read(mraa_gpio_context dev)

```
