```c
  pktin = sftp_wait_for_reply(req);
  dirh = fxp_opendir_recv(pktin, req);

  if (dirh == NULL) {
    printf("Unable to open %s: %s\n", dir, fxp_error());
    return 0;
  } else {
    nnames = namesize = 0;
    ournames = NULL;

    while (1) {

```

**Reasoning:**
The conflict involves error handling when `dirh` is NULL. Both versions agree on printing the error message, but differ in subsequent behavior:
1. The HEAD version continues execution after printing (falling through to the else block)
2. The branch version adds `return 0` to terminate the function early

The resolution adds `return 0` because:
- Without early return, execution would incorrectly proceed to the else block (which requires valid `dirh`)
- The else block contains resource initialization (`ournames = NULL`) and loop that depends on valid `dirh`
- Returning after failure follows standard error-handling patterns
- Preserves the original context and spacing exactly as required
