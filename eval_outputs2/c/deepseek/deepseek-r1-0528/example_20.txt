**Explanation:**  
The conflict shows one branch added a `'u'` case handler while the other branch didn't have this change. Without additional context about why `'u'` was added/removed or whether these changes are compatible, it's ambiguous whether to keep or remove the case handler. Since the intent isn't clear, the conflict markers are preserved according to the instructions.
