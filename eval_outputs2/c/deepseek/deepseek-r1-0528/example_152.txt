I've analyzed the merge conflict and resolved it based on the semantic intent of both branches. The conflict occurs at the end of a function where one branch adds a `return 1;` statement while the other branch doesn't modify this section.

The resolution keeps the `return 1;` statement because:
1. The function appears to be non-void (given the comment about returning special error values)
2. The `return 1;` provides an explicit return value for this code path
3. Without this return, control would flow to the function's end without a return value

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```c
    } else if (plug_accepting(s->plug, sk_tcp_accept, actx)) {
      p_closesocket(t); /* denied or error */
    }
  }
  }

  return 1;
}

/*
 * Special error values are returned from sk_namelookup and sk_new
 * if there's a problem. These functions extract an error message,
```
