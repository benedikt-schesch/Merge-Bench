```c
      /* This is so the ALT-Numpad and dead keys work correctly. */
      keys_unicode[0] = 0;

      return p - output;
    }
    /* If we're definitely not building up an ALT-54321 then clear it */
    if (!left_alt)
      keys_unicode[0] = 0;
    /* If we will be using alt_sum fix the 256s */
    else if (keys_unicode[0] && (in_utf(term) || ucsdata.dbcs_screenfont))
      keys_unicode[0] = 10;
```

**Resolution Rationale:**  
The conflict was purely about comment spelling correction ("definitly" â†’ "definitely"). Both branches functionally agree on the subsequent code logic. The corrected spelling improves readability without altering behavior, making this a safe resolution. The semantic intent of clearing `keys_unicode[0]` when not building ALT-codes remains unchanged.
