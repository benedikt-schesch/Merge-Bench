Based on the provided context, the conflict appears to be about the correct capitalization and naming convention for initializing common controls. Both versions serve the same semantic purpose (initialization), but use different naming styles:

1. **HEAD version** uses `InitCommonControls()` - PascalCase naming
2. **Other branch** uses `init_common_controls()` - snake_case naming

Without additional context about the project's naming conventions or existing codebase style, it's ambiguous which version should be preferred. Both are functionally equivalent in intent but syntactically different.

Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```c
  char **argv;
  int ret;

  dll_hijacking_protection();

<<<<<<< HEAD
  InitCommonControls();
=======
  init_common_controls();
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
  hinst = inst;
  hwnd = NULL;

  /*
   * See if we can find our Help file.
```

Recommendations for resolution:
1. Check project style guide for naming conventions
2. Verify existence of both functions in the codebase
3. Determine if this is a standard API call (WinAPI uses `InitCommonControls`) or custom wrapper
4. Look for similar function calls elsewhere in the codebase

Since the intent is ambiguous without broader context, the conflict should be resolved manually by a developer familiar with the codebase conventions.
