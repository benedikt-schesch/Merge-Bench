Based on the semantic analysis of the conflict, both versions aim to assign the current node's data to variable `c` for further processing. The conflict arises from a type declaration difference that appears to be a refactoring change where explicit casting became unnecessary. 

The resolution maintains the cleaner, more modern approach (removing the redundant cast) while preserving all functionality since:
1. The context shows `c` is used as a connection pointer (`c->status.remove`)
2. `connection_del(c)` expects a connection pointer
3. The removal of the cast suggests the data structure was refactored to contain the correct type

Resolved snippet:

```c

	FD_ZERO(fs);

	for(node = connection_tree->head; node; node = next) {
		next = node->next;
		c = node->data;

		if(c->status.remove) {
			connection_del(c);
			if(!connection_tree->head)
				purge();
```
