The conflict involves a missing return statement after error handling. Both branches close the socket and clear the pointer, but the HEAD branch explicitly returns 1 (indicating an error condition) while the other branch omits this. Since the function appears to expect an integer return value (as evidenced by the subsequent function declaration with `static int`), preserving the explicit error return maintains functional integrity and avoids undefined behavior.

Resolved code:
```c
  struct pageant_listen_state *pl = (struct pageant_listen_state *)plug;
  if (error_msg)
    plog(pl->logctx, pl->logfn, "listening socket: error: %s", error_msg);
  sk_close(pl->listensock);
  pl->listensock = NULL;
  return 1;
}

static int pageant_listen_accepting(Plug plug,
                                    accept_fn_t constructor,
                                    accept_ctx_t ctx)

```
