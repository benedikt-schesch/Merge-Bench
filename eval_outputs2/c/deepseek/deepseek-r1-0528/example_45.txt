Based on the analysis of both changes, the difference is purely stylistic regarding pointer casting in C. The semantic intent is identical - both versions correctly allocate memory for a `past_request_t` structure. The version without explicit casting is more idiomatic in modern C code since `void*` conversions are implicit.

Here's the resolved code preserving all context:

```c

	if(avl_search(past_request_tree, &p)) {
		ifdebug(SCARY_THINGS) logger(LOG_DEBUG, _("Already seen request"));
		return true;
	} else {
		new = xmalloc(sizeof(*new));
		new->request = xstrdup(request);
		new->firstseen = now;
		avl_insert(past_request_tree, new);
		return false;
	}

```

Key resolution points:
1. Removed explicit cast `(past_request_t *)` as redundant in C
2. Maintained identical memory allocation behavior
3. Preserved all surrounding logic and formatting
4. Kept all context lines unchanged
5. The resolution follows common C conventions while maintaining semantic equivalence

The change is safe because:
- `xmalloc` returns `void*` which implicitly converts to any pointer type
- Both versions allocate identical memory sizes (`sizeof(*new)`)
- Subsequent member assignments remain unchanged
