The intent of both branches is ambiguous without knowing the function's return type. The HEAD branch returns integer values (0 and 1), while the other branch omits return statements entirely. Since:

1. We don't have the function signature to verify the return type
2. The behavior difference is significant (returning values vs. void behavior)
3. Both versions could be correct depending on unseen context

I'm returning the unresolved conflict as the intent cannot be safely determined:

```c
{
  Ssh ssh = (Ssh)plug;
  ssh_gotdata(ssh, (unsigned char *)data, len);
  if (ssh->state == SSH_STATE_CLOSED) {
    ssh_do_close(ssh, TRUE);
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return 0;
  }
  return 1;
=======
  }
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

static void ssh_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  Ssh ssh = (Ssh)plug;

```
