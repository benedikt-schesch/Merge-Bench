I've analyzed the merge conflict and determined that the intent is ambiguous without additional context about the data type of `term->esc_args[i]`. Since we don't have information about whether these values should be treated as signed or unsigned integers, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact as instructed.

```c
              char lbuf[64];
              strcpy(term->id_string, "\033[?");
              for (i = 1; i < term->esc_nargs; i++) {
                if (i != 1)
                  strcat(term->id_string, ";");
<<<<<<< HEAD
                sprintf(lbuf, "%d", term->esc_args[i]);

                sprintf(lbuf, "%u", term->esc_args[i]);

                strcat(term->id_string, lbuf);
              }
              strcat(term->id_string, "c");
            }
