No reasoning found</think>
I've analyzed the provided merge conflict. Both sides are attempting to check if the backend connection is established before reading from stdin, but they differ in the condition:

1. The HEAD version requires two conditions: `connopen` flag AND `back->connected(backhandle)`
2. The other branch only checks `back->connected(backhandle)`

This is ambiguous because:
- We don't know if `connopen` is redundant or provides necessary state tracking
- We can't determine if `back->connected()` is safe to call without `connopen`
- There's no context about how these variables are maintained

Since the intent is unclear and both conditions might be important for different reasons, I'm returning the code with the conflict unresolved as instructed:

```c

    if (FD_ISSET(STDIN_FILENO, &rset)) {
      char buf[4096];
      int ret;

<<<<<<< HEAD
      if (connopen && back->connected(backhandle)) {
=======
      if (back->connected(backhandle)) {
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
        ret = read(STDIN_FILENO, buf, sizeof(buf));
        if (ret < 0) {
          perror("stdin: read");
          exit(1);
        } else if (ret == 0) {

```
