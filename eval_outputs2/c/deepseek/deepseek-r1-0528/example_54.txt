The merge conflict involves handling the `elf_end` call and associated comments. The HEAD version includes a call to `elf_end(elf->elf)` with surrounding whitespace, while the other branch comments it out with a `LEAK` marker and adds an extra newline. Since the intent behind commenting out vs. keeping the `elf_end` call is ambiguous (possibly due to resource management concerns), and without additional context to determine which approach is correct, the conflict remains unresolved.

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```c

  elf->symtab_data = elf->debug_data->symtab_data;
  elf->symtab_shdr = elf->debug_data->symtab_shdr;

  /* XXX free stuff */
<<<<<<< HEAD

  elf_end(elf->elf);
=======
  /* LEAK elf_end(elf->elf); */

>>>>>>> ffc859cb81926982c1323abf81704f5b0366dcc2
  elf->elf = elf->debug_data->elf;
  close(elf->debug_data->fd);

  dbg_printf("Finished dissecting debug data\n");
  return 0;

```
