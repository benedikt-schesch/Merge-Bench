The conflict occurs because the incoming change adds an optional post-write hook using `advance_func.gpio_write_post`, while the base code doesn't have this feature. Both changes share the same error handling for the write operation and ultimately return `MRAA_SUCCESS` on success. The intent is to add a new feature while preserving existing behavior.

The resolution integrates the new hook functionality while maintaining the original success/error flow:

```c
    int length = snprintf(bu, sizeof(bu), "%d", value);
    if (write(dev->value_fp, bu, length*sizeof(char)) == -1) {
        return MRAA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE;
    }

    if (advance_func.gpio_write_post != NULL)
        return advance_func.gpio_write_post(dev,value);
    return MRAA_SUCCESS;
}

static mraa_result_t
mraa_gpio_unexport_force(mraa_gpio_context dev)
```

Key resolution points:
1. The error handling for `write()` remains unchanged
2. The new hook call is added after successful write
3. When the hook exists, its return value is propagated
4. Original `MRAA_SUCCESS` return is preserved for the no-hook case
5. Maintains backward compatibility for existing callers
6. Enables new functionality through `advance_func` interface
