Based on the provided context, I can't determine the semantic purpose of the `char buf[4096]` declaration since:

1. The buffer is declared but never used in the visible context
2. The function appears to be incomplete in the snippet
3. The opposing commit completely removed this declaration
4. There's no visible functionality that would require this buffer

Since I can't verify if this buffer is needed later in the function (outside the visible snippet) and the intent is ambiguous, I'm returning the unresolved conflict as instructed:

```c
                      (HANDLE, LPVOID, DWORD, LPDWORD));

static void init_winfuncs(void)
{
  static int initialised = FALSE;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  char buf[4096];

  if (initialised)
    return;
  {
    HMODULE winspool_module = load_system32_dll("winspool.drv");
```
