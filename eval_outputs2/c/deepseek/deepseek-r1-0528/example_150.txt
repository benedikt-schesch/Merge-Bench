I'll return the code snippet exactly as provided with the merge conflict markers intact, since the intent behind the conflicting changes is ambiguous without more context. Here's the preserved snippet:

```c
  } else {
    /*
     * Otherwise, we've successfully thawed!
     */
    ps->frozen = UNFROZEN;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    handle_unthrottle(ps->recv_h, new_backlog);
=======
    handle_unthrottle(ps->recv_h, 0);
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
  }
}

static void sk_handle_set_frozen(Socket s, int is_frozen)
{
```

The conflict exists because:
1. HEAD uses a variable `new_backlog` suggesting dynamic backlog adjustment
2. The other branch uses a fixed value `0` suggesting complete unthrottling

Without understanding:
- Where `new_backlog` is defined
- The semantics of `handle_unthrottle`
- Why these different values were chosen
- The broader context of the throttling system

...I cannot safely resolve this conflict. The differences appear semantically significant (dynamic value vs hardcoded zero), so manual resolution by a developer familiar with this codebase is required.
