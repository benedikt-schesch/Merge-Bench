The conflict arises from differing syntax for accessing the `data` field in a linked list node. Both versions aim to retrieve a connection object (`connection_t *`), but they use different syntax:

1. **HEAD version** uses explicit casting: `(connection_t *) node->data`
2. **Other branch** uses direct access: `node->data`

After analyzing the semantics:
- Both achieve the same goal of assigning `connection_t *c`
- The direct access (`node->data`) is cleaner and functionally equivalent in C when `node->data` is already a `connection_t *`
- The explicit cast is redundant if the data type is correct

Resolution: Keep the simpler syntax from the other branch since it's semantically equivalent and more idiomatic.

Resolved code:
```c
			}

			/* Close connections to hosts that have a changed or deleted host config file */
			
			for(node = connection_tree->head; node; node = node->next) {
				c = node->data;
				
				if(c->outgoing) {
					free(c->outgoing->name);
					freeaddrinfo(c->outgoing->ai);
					free(c->outgoing);
```
