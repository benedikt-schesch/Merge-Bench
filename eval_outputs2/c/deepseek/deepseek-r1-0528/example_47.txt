The merge conflict involves an `extern` declaration for `tunnelserver` added in one branch but missing in HEAD. Since this declaration appears to be a global variable needed by the other branch, and there are no semantic conflicts with existing code in the context, it should be preserved. The resolution maintains the declaration while keeping all surrounding context unchanged.

```c
typedef struct past_request_t {
	char *request;
	time_t firstseen;
} past_request_t;

extern bool tunnelserver;

/* Maximum size of strings in a request */

#define MAX_STRING_SIZE 2048
#define MAX_STRING "%2048s"

```
