The merge conflict centers around a return statement. The HEAD branch includes `return 1;` while the other branch removes this line. Without additional context about the function's return type or purpose, it's impossible to determine whether the return statement is semantically necessary. Both versions are logically valid but might serve different error-handling or control flow purposes in their respective branches.

Since the intent is ambiguous, the conflict should be preserved for manual resolution:

```c
  struct ssh_sharing_state *sharestate = (struct ssh_sharing_state *)plug;
  if (error_msg)
    ssh_sharing_logf(sharestate->ssh, 0, "listening socket: %s", error_msg);
  sk_close(sharestate->listensock);
  sharestate->listensock = NULL;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return 1;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

static void share_send_verstring(struct ssh_sharing_connstate *cs)
{
  char *fullstring = dupcat("SSHCONNECTION@putty.projects.tartarus.org-2.0-",
```

Resolution requires knowing:
1. The function's return type (void vs non-void)
2. Whether the caller expects a return value
3. Error-handling semantics of the surrounding code

A developer should examine the function signature and usage to determine if the return statement is needed.
