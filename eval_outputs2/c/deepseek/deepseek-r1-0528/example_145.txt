The conflict arises from both branches modifying the same function by adding different Windows API imports. The `HEAD` branch imports `FlashWindowEx` and `PlaySound`, while the other branch imports `FlashWindowEx`, `ToUnicodeEx`, and `PlaySound`. 

The semantic intent is:
1. Both branches require `FlashWindowEx` and `PlaySound`
2. The other branch additionally requires `ToUnicodeEx` for keyboard input handling
3. These are complementary changes rather than mutually exclusive

Here's the resolved version preserving all context:

```c
static void init_winfuncs(void)
{
  HMODULE user32_module = load_system32_dll("user32.dll");
  HMODULE winmm_module = load_system32_dll("winmm.dll");
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(user32_module, FlashWindowEx);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(user32_module, ToUnicodeEx);
  GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION_PP(winmm_module, PlaySound);
}

/*
 * Translate a WM_(SYS)?KEY(UP|DOWN) message into a string of ASCII
```

Key resolution points:
1. Kept `FlashWindowEx` from HEAD
2. Added `ToUnicodeEx` from the other branch
3. Kept `PlaySound` from both
4. Preserved all spacing and context exactly
5. Removed conflict markers while maintaining both functional requirements

The resolved version satisfies both branches' needs: HEAD's window flashing functionality and the other branch's keyboard input handling capability.
