The conflict centers around the line `connopen = 1;` added in HEAD but absent in the other branch. Without broader context about the purpose of `connopen` or why it was removed in the other branch, the intent is ambiguous. For example:

1. If `connopen` tracks connection state, keeping it might be critical
2. If the state is now managed elsewhere (e.g., in `ldisc_create`), removing it might be intentional

Since the semantics can't be definitively resolved, the conflict is preserved as instructed:

```c
    }
    back->provide_logctx(backhandle, logctx);
    ldisc_create(conf, NULL, back, backhandle, NULL);
    sfree(realhost);
  }
