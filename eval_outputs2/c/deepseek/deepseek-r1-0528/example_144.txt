```c

    case IDA_WEB:
      /* Load web browser */
      ShellExecute(hwnd,
                   "open",
                   "https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/",
                   0,
                   0,
                   SW_SHOWDEFAULT);
      return 0;
    }

```

Resolution reasoning:
1. Both sides intend to launch the same PuTTY website URL
2. The HTTPS version provides a secure connection (encrypted traffic)
3. The modern version of the website supports HTTPS
4. The branch commit (4348393f) likely updated to HTTPS for security best practices
5. Preserving the URL structure maintains identical functionality while upgrading security
6. The surrounding parameters (0,0, SW_SHOWDEFAULT) remain unchanged

The conflict is resolved by selecting the HTTPS version as it's semantically equivalent but more secure. The context before and after remains unchanged.
