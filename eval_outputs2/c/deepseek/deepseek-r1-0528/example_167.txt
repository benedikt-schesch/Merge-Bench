The conflict involves the type casting of `result` in a macro definition. The HEAD version uses `result` directly, while the other branch explicitly casts it to `(unsigned)`. Since the surrounding context doesn't provide enough information to determine the correct type semantics (e.g., whether the macro expects signed or unsigned values), and the test invocation uses a signed integer `7` as the expected result, the intent is ambiguous. 

Without clear semantic direction, the conflict cannot be safely resolved. The original conflict markers are preserved as required.
