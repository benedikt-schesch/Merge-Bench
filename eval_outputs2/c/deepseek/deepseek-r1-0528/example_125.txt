The conflict involves the return type of the `agent_select_result` function. Since there's no additional context about the function's implementation or usage, it's impossible to determine whether the function should return `int` or `void`. The surrounding code shows memory cleanup operations, but doesn't reveal any dependencies on the function's return type. Without more information about the function's body or its callers, this conflict cannot be safely resolved.

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
  close(conn->fd);
  del234(agent_pending_queries, conn);
  sfree(conn);
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
static int agent_select_result(int fd, int event)

{
  agent_pending_query *conn;

  assert(event == 1); /* not selecting for anything but R */


```
