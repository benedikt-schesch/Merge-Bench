Based on the semantic analysis, both changes appear to be independent additions that can coexist. The HEAD change adds a function declaration for `ngx_http_cache_purge_response_type_conf`, while the other branch adds two static helper functions. Since these serve different purposes and there are no naming conflicts, we can include both.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```c
char       *ngx_http_uwsgi_cache_purge_conf(ngx_conf_t *cf,
        ngx_command_t *cmd, void *conf);
ngx_int_t   ngx_http_uwsgi_cache_purge_handler(ngx_http_request_t *r);
# endif /* NGX_HTTP_UWSGI */

char        *ngx_http_cache_purge_response_type_conf(ngx_conf_t *cf, 
                ngx_command_t *cmd, void *conf);
static ngx_int_t
ngx_http_purge_file_cache_noop(ngx_tree_ctx_t *ctx, ngx_str_t *path);
static ngx_int_t
ngx_http_purge_file_cache_delete_file(ngx_tree_ctx_t *ctx, ngx_str_t *path);

ngx_int_t   ngx_http_cache_purge_access_handler(ngx_http_request_t *r);
ngx_int_t   ngx_http_cache_purge_access(ngx_array_t *a, ngx_array_t *a6,
                                        struct sockaddr *s);

```

Resolution rationale:
1. Preserved HEAD's `ngx_http_cache_purge_response_type_conf` declaration
2. Kept both static helper functions from the other branch
3. Maintained original formatting and context
4. Ordered declarations logically (new feature function first, then helper functions)
5. Verified no naming conflicts or overlapping functionality
