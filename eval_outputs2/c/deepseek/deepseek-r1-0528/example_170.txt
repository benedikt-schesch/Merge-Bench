The conflict arises from initializing `qhead->prefixlen` immediately after allocation (HEAD) vs. skipping initialization (other branch). The HEAD version has a potential NULL dereference bug since `qhead->prefixlen = 0` executes before checking if `malloc` succeeded. The resolution moves the initialization after the NULL check to maintain the HEAD's intent safely while incorporating the other branch's structural change.

Resolved snippet:
```c
  struct bucket *qhead, *qtail;
  extern char **environ;
  char **e;

  qhead = (struct bucket *)malloc(sizeof(struct bucket));
  if (!qhead) {
    fprintf(stderr, "out of memory\n");
    exit(1);
  }
  qhead->prefixlen = 0;
<<<<<<< HEAD
