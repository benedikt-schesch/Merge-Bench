The merge conflict arises from two different methods of destroying objects after moving them to a new memory location. Both approaches achieve the same semantic goal but use different syntax:

1. **HEAD version** uses allocator-aware destruction:  
   `std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy(alloc, &old_items[i]);`  
   This is the modern, generic approach that works with any allocator type.

2. **Incoming branch** uses direct destructor call:  
   `old_items[i].~T();`  
   This is a lower-level approach that directly invokes the destructor.

The resolution uses the **HEAD version** because:
- It maintains consistency with the allocator-aware allocation (`alloc.allocate`)
- It's the standard C++ approach when working with custom allocators
- `std::allocator_traits` ensures proper behavior even with minimal allocators

Here's the resolved code:

```c
        /* reallocate and copy items */
        T* old_items = items;
        items = alloc.allocate(new_alloced);
        for (size_t i=0; i<size_active; i++) {
          ::new (&items[i]) T(std::move(old_items[i]));
          std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy(alloc, &old_items[i]);
        }

        for (size_t i=size_active; i<new_active; i++) {
          ::new (&items[i]) T;
        }

```
