**Explanation of unresolved conflict:**  
The conflict shows two different function calls (`MakeDragList` vs `p_MakeDragList`) with identical parameters. Without additional context about:
1. The origin/meaning of `p_MakeDragList` (wrapper function? renamed API?)
2. Why the change was made in either branch
3. Header file modifications

...it's impossible to determine the correct resolution. Both versions appear semantically equivalent in behavior but imply different underlying implementations. Preserving the conflict markers is necessary for manual resolution.
