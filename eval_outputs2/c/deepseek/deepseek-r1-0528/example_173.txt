Based on the provided context, I cannot safely resolve this conflict. The key ambiguity is whether the surrounding function should return a value (`return 1;`) or not at this location. Since the function signature isn't visible in the snippet, I can't determine if:

1. The function is supposed to return a value (int) and requires the return statement (HEAD version)
2. The function is void and the return was incorrectly added (other branch version)
3. The function's return type was changed between branches

Without seeing the function declaration or understanding the broader context, this conflict requires human judgment. Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```c
    plog(pc->logctx, pc->logfn, "%p: error: %s", pc, error_msg);
  else
    plog(pc->logctx, pc->logfn, "%p: connection closed", pc);
  sk_close(pc->connsock);
  sfree(pc);
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return 1;

static void pageant_conn_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  /* struct pageant_conn_state *pc = (struct pageant_conn_state *)plug; */
```
