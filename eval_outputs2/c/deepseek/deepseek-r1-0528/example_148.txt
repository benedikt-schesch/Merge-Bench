I'll help resolve this semantic merge conflict while preserving the context exactly. The conflict is about variable declarations - one branch added a `new_backlog` variable while the other branch only declares `len`. Since I don't have visibility into how these variables are used later in the function, I must consider this ambiguous and keep the conflict markers.

Here's the exact output with preserved spacing and conflict markers:

```c

static void handle_socket_unfreeze(void *psv)
{
  Handle_Socket ps = (Handle_Socket)psv;
  void *data;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  int len, new_backlog;
=======
  int len;
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5

  /*
   * If we've been put into a state other than THAWING since the
   * last callback, then we're done.
   */

```

Reason for keeping conflict:
- The HEAD branch introduces `new_backlog` which might be used later for socket backlog management
- The other branch only declares `len`, suggesting `new_backlog` might not be needed
- Without seeing the full function implementation, I can't determine if `new_backlog` is required
- The comment block doesn't provide enough context to resolve this semantically
- Preserving the conflict allows developers to decide based on complete knowledge of the codebase
