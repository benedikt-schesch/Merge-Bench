The merge conflict involves different function calls (`DrawInsert` vs `p_DrawInsert`) for the same operation. Without additional context about their implementations or the project's naming conventions, it's impossible to determine which function is correct. Both branches appear to be attempting the same semantic action (drawing an insertion mark), but the ambiguity in function naming prevents safe resolution. 

Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```c
      case DL_DROPPED:
        if (hdl->dragging) {
          dest = pl_itemfrompt(dlm->hWnd, dlm->ptCursor, TRUE);
          if (dest > hdl->dummyitem)
            dest = hdl->dummyitem;
<<<<<<< HEAD
          DrawInsert(hwnd, dlm->hWnd, -1);
=======
          p_DrawInsert(hwnd, dlm->hWnd, -1);
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
        }
        SendDlgItemMessage(
            hwnd, hdl->listid, LB_DELETESTRING, hdl->dummyitem, 0);
        if (hdl->dragging) {
          hdl->dragging = 0;

```
