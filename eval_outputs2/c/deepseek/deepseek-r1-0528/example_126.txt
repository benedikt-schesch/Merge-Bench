The merge conflict occurs after `agent_cancel_query(conn)`, where one branch adds a `return 0;` statement while the other branch does not. Since the function's return type isn't visible in the snippet, it's ambiguous whether the function should return a value at this point. Resolving this requires knowing the function signature (which isn't provided). 

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
   * clean up. (Of course we don't free retbuf, since ownership
   * of that passes to the callback.)
   */
  conn->callback(conn->callback_ctx, conn->retbuf, conn->retlen);
  agent_cancel_query(conn);
