Based on the semantic analysis, both versions aim to destroy elements but use different methods. The HEAD version uses `std::allocator_traits` which is the correct allocator-aware approach since the code later uses `alloc.deallocate`. The other branch uses explicit destructor calls which may not respect custom allocator behavior. The HEAD version is semantically correct for this context.

Resolved code:
```c
      }

      __forceinline void clear() 
      {
        /* destroy elements */
        for (size_t i=0; i<size_active; i++)
          std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy(alloc, &items[i]);
        
        /* free memory */
        alloc.deallocate(items,size_alloced); 
        items = nullptr;
        size_active = size_alloced = 0;
```
