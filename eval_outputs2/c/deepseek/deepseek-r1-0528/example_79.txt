Based on the semantic analysis of the merge conflict, here's the resolved snippet. The conflict was about adding a global constant `buildinfo_gtk_relevant` between two function definitions. Since this is an additive change that doesn't conflict with existing functionality, it can be safely merged:

```c

  gtk_initialised = ret;
  return ret;
}

const int buildinfo_gtk_relevant = TRUE;

char *gtk_askpass_main(const char *display,
                       const char *wintitle,
                       const char *prompt,
                       int *success)
{
```

**Resolution rationale:**  
1. The `buildinfo_gtk_relevant` constant appears to be a harmless global declaration likely used for build configuration or feature flags  
2. Its placement between the two function definitions is syntactically correct in C  
3. The HEAD branch contained no conflicting changes in this location (just empty space)  
4. The addition doesn't modify existing functions or variables  
5. Both branches' intents are preserved:  
   - HEAD: Function definitions remain unchanged  
   - Other branch: Build constant is added  

The spacing and context are preserved exactly as provided, with only the conflict markers removed.
