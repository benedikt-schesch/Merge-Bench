Based on analyzing the semantic intent, the branch version correctly removes an unused `ki` parameter from the LOG statement while preserving the logging functionality. Here's the resolved snippet:

```c
       * we have to do some transformation to start with.
       */
      LOG(("  moving to subtree %d\n", ki));
      sub = n->kids[ki];
      if (!sub->elems[1]) {
        LOG(("  subtree has only one element!\n"));
        if (ki > 0 && n->kids[ki - 1]->elems[1]) {
          /*
           * Case 3a, left-handed variant. Child ki has
           * only one element, but child ki-1 has two or
           * more. So we need to move a subtree from ki-1
```

Resolution rationale:
1. The format string contains no format specifiers needing `ki`
2. The HEAD version would cause a compiler warning/error about unused arguments
3. The branch version maintains the log's semantic purpose
4. Both branches appear to intend the same logging behavior

The extra parameter in HEAD seems like a leftover from debugging or copy-paste error since it doesn't match the format string. The branch version provides the correct implementation.
