Since the intent behind the `char *lua;` declaration is ambiguous (it's declared in HEAD but unused in the provided context, while the other branch removes it), and without full visibility into how this variable is used later in the function, I cannot safely resolve this conflict. The merge conflict markers are preserved as required.

```c
	tupid_t newdt;
	struct tup_entry *oldtent = tf->curtent;
	int old_dfd = tf->cur_dfd;
	struct tup_entry *srctent = NULL;
	struct tup_entry *newtent;
<<<<<<< HEAD
	char *lua;

	if(get_path_elements(file, &pg) < 0)
		goto out_err;
	if(pg.pg_flags & PG_HIDDEN) {
		fprintf(tf->f, "tup error: Unable to include file with hidden path element.\n");

```
