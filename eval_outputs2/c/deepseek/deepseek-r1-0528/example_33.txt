```c
			ifdebug(SCARY_THINGS) logger(LOG_DEBUG, _("Purging node %s (%s)"), n->name,
					   n->hostname);

			for(snode = n->subnet_tree->head; snode; snode = snext) {
				snext = snode->next;
				s = snode->data;
				if(!tunnelserver)
					send_del_subnet(broadcast, s);
				subnet_del(n, s);
			}

			for(enode = n->edge_tree->head; enode; enode = enext) {
				enext = enode->next;

```

Reasoning:
1. Preserved the cast removal from the feature branch (`s = snode->data;`) as this appears to be a type system improvement
2. Kept the tunnelserver condition (`if(!tunnelserver)`) which adds important behavior control
3. Maintained the critical `subnet_del()` call from both branches
4. Preserved all surrounding context and indentation exactly as provided

The resolution maintains both semantic improvements:
- The type cast removal suggests better type safety was implemented in the feature branch
- The tunnelserver condition adds necessary control logic without altering the core deletion functionality

Note: The edge_tree loop remains unchanged as it wasn't part of the conflict.
