The merge conflict involves a discrepancy in function termination logic. The HEAD branch includes a `return !finished;` statement after setting `serial->finished = TRUE`, while the other branch completely omits this return statement. Since there's no surrounding context showing the function's return type declaration or the declaration of the `finished` variable, it's impossible to determine semantic intent with certainty.

The conflict remains unresolved due to:
1. Ambiguity in function's expected return type (void vs non-void)
2. Unknown scope and meaning of `finished` variable
3. Lack of context showing function signature

Here's the original code with conflict markers preserved:

```c

    serial->finished = TRUE;

    notify_remote_exit(serial->frontend);
  }
<<<<<<< HEAD

  return !finished;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

static void serial_uxsel_setup(Serial serial)
{
  int rwx = 0;

```
