The conflict involves two branches making changes at the same location. The HEAD branch only calls `mm_do_lock_slow()` when `ret` is true, while the other branch adds `_spinlock_unlock()` and `sched_yield()` after the lock attempt. Since the intent of these operations is ambiguous (the unlock/yield might be required for resource management or scheduling, but could conflict with locking semantics), and without more context about the locking strategy, it's unsafe to automatically resolve this. 

The conflict is preserved as shown below:

```c

        if (ret) {
            /* Still no luck, try the slow approach */
            mm_do_lock_slow(&lock->locked);
        }
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
        _spinlock_unlock(lock);
        sched_yield();
>>>>>>> 5921a191ef461e97a894063110b45f415affddcb
    }
    return 1;
}

static void mm_do_lock_slow(volatile unsigned int* locked)

```
