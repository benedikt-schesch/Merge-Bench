The conflict arises from differing approaches to error reporting when `canonify()` fails. Both sides agree on:
1. Printing an error message
2. Returning 0
3. The message format `"%s: canonify: %s\n"`

The disagreement is about which path to display:
- **HEAD** uses `dir` (result of `canonify()`)
- **Other branch** uses `cmd->words[i]` (original input)

Since `dir` is NULL when this error occurs (as checked by `if (!dir)`), dereferencing it for printing would cause undefined behavior. The other branch's approach using the original input `cmd->words[i]` is safer and more useful for debugging.

Resolved version:
```c

  ret = 1;
  for (i = 1; i < cmd->nwords; i++) {
    dir = canonify(cmd->words[i]);
    if (!dir) {
      printf("%s: canonify: %s\n", cmd->words[i], fxp_error());
      return 0;
    }

    req = fxp_mkdir_send(dir);
    pktin = sftp_wait_for_reply(req);
```
