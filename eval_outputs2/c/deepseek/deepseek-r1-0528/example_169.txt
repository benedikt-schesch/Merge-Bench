Based on the provided code snippet, I've analyzed the semantic intent of both sides of the merge conflict. Here's the resolution:

```c
  if (sshfwd_write(xconn->c, data, len) > 0) {
    xconn->throttled = 1;
    xconn->no_data_sent_to_x_client = FALSE;
    sk_set_frozen(xconn->s, 1);
  }

  return 1;
}

static void x11_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  struct X11Connection *xconn = (struct X11Connection *)plug;
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. The `return 1;` statement from the HEAD branch is semantically necessary as:
   - The function appears to be non-void (based on the return statement)
   - Without this return, control would reach end of non-void function
   - The return value likely indicates successful processing

2. The conflicting commit (4348393) only removed this return statement without providing an alternative flow control mechanism, which would create compilation errors.

3. The blank line before `return 1;` is preserved for consistent formatting with the original HEAD version.

The resolved version maintains both the functional behavior from HEAD and proper control flow while preserving the original context and spacing.
