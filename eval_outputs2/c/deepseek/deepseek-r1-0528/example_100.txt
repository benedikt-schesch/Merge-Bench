The conflict involves a minor spelling correction in a comment. Both sides are identical except for the spelling of "successfully". The branch version uses the correct spelling, so it should be chosen. Here's the resolved snippet:

```c
      attempts++;
    }
  }

  /*
   * If we get here, we've successfully loaded the key into
   * rkey/skey, but not yet added it to the agent.
   */

  /*
   * If the key was successfully decrypted, save the passphrase for
```

Key points:
1. Removed conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5`)
2. Kept the branch's spelling correction ("successfully" instead of "succesfully")
3. Preserved all surrounding context exactly as originally formatted
4. Maintained identical comment structure and subsequent lines

The resolution aligns with standard spelling while maintaining identical semantic meaning in the comment. No functional changes were made.
