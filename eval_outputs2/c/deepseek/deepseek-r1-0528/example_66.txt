Based on the semantic analysis, I've resolved the conflict by preserving both changes while maintaining proper spacing and context. The other branch adds a global constant that's explicitly documented as harmless, so it can be safely included after the macro definition before the main function.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```c
  modalfatalbox("random_byte called in testbn");
  return 0;
}

#define fromxdigit(c) ((c) > '9' ? ((c)&0xDF) - 'A' + 10 : (c) - '0')

/* For Unix in particular, but harmless if this main() is reused elsewhere */
const int buildinfo_gtk_relevant = FALSE;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *buf;
  int line = 0;
```

Key resolution points:
1. Preserved the `fromxdigit` macro from HEAD unchanged
2. Kept the added comment and global constant from the other branch
3. Maintained the blank line spacing after the macro for readability
4. Preserved the original spacing before the `main` function declaration
5. The added constant is:
   - Marked `const` (safe for global scope)
   - Explicitly documented as harmless
   - Unix-specific but portable
   - Doesn't conflict with existing HEAD content

The solution maintains both branches' semantics while keeping the code structure clean and consistent.
