Based on the provided code snippet, I notice that the conflict revolves around the declaration of the `open` variable. After analyzing both sides:

1. The HEAD branch declares both `ret` and `open` as integers
2. The other branch declares only `ret` (removing `open`)

Since the function body after the declarations isn't visible in the snippet, and we don't see how `open` is used later in the function, the intent is ambiguous. We can't determine if:
- `open` is needed later in the function (HEAD is correct)
- Or if it was removed for being redundant (other branch is correct)

Without seeing the full function implementation, this conflict can't be safely resolved. Here's the original snippet preserved with conflict markers:

```c
    try_send(s);
}

void select_result(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
<<<<<<< HEAD
  int ret, open;
=======
  int ret;
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
  DWORD err;
  char buf[20480]; /* nice big buffer for plenty of speed */
  Actual_Socket s;
  u_long atmark;
