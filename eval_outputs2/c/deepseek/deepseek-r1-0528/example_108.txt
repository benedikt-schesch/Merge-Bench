The merge conflict involves two distinct changes that are semantically independent but adjacent in the code. The ambiguity arises because:

1. The return type of `rlogin_receive` differs (`int` vs `void`)
2. The presence of `return 0` in one branch affects an unrelated function
3. The surrounding context doesn't reveal if the containing function (where `return 0` exists) should return a value
4. The function body after the conflict doesn't show if `rlogin_receive` needs to return a value

Since the semantic intent is ambiguous without broader context, the conflict is preserved unchanged.

```c
  if (error_msg) {
    /* A socket error has occurred. */
    logevent(rlogin->frontend, error_msg);
    connection_fatal(rlogin->frontend, "%s", error_msg);
  } /* Otherwise, the remote side closed the connection normally. */
