The conflict involves whether to include a `return 0;` statement after handling a normal connection closure. Both branches agree on the error handling logic, but the HEAD branch explicitly returns 0 (indicating success) after the comment, while the other branch omits this return statement.

Since the function signature isn't visible in the snippet, we can't determine whether the function is expected to return a value (non-void) or not (void). Including the return statement would break a void function, while omitting it could cause undefined behavior in a non-void function. Given this ambiguity, the conflict remains unresolved.

```c
  if (error_msg) {
    logevent(telnet->frontend, error_msg);
    connection_fatal(telnet->frontend, "%s", error_msg);
  }
  /* Otherwise, the remote side closed the connection normally. */
