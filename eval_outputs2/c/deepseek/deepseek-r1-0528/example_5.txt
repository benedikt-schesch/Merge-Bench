Based on analyzing the semantic intent of both changes, the conflict arises from different copyright year ranges. The resolution maintains the most current copyright year while preserving the structure of the `zend_extension` declaration. Here's the resolved snippet:

```c
static zend_extension eaccelerator_extension_entry = {
    EACCELERATOR_EXTENSION_NAME,
    EACCELERATOR_VERSION,
    "eAccelerator",
    "http://eaccelerator.net",
    "Copyright (c) 2004-2015 eAccelerator",
    eaccelerator_zend_startup,
    NULL,
    NULL,   /* void (*activate)() */
    NULL,   /* void (*deactivate)() */
    NULL,   /* void (*message_handle)(int message, void *arg) */
```

Key resolution rationale:
1. Copyright dates represent the valid timeframe of ownership
2. `HEAD`'s 2015 end-date supersedes the branch's 2014 date
3. Both changes share identical surrounding context
4. Structure/functionality remains unaffected by this text change

The resolution maintains project accuracy by using the most recent copyright year while preserving all functional elements of the struct initialization.
