```c

      __forceinline void pop_back() 
      {
        assert(!empty());
        size_active--;
        std::allocator_traits<allocator>::destroy(alloc, &items[size_active]);
      }

      __forceinline void clear() 
      {
        /* destroy elements */

```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. **Semantic Analysis:** Both versions aim to properly destroy the object when removing it from the container. The key difference is the destruction mechanism.
2. **Allocator Awareness:** The HEAD version correctly uses the allocator's destruction mechanism via `std::allocator_traits`, which is essential for:
   - Custom allocator support
   - Proper handling of stateful allocators
   - Alignment with modern C++ container best practices
3. **Safety:** The explicit destructor call (`items[size_active].~T()`) in the other branch bypasses allocator customization points and may be unsafe with specialized allocators.
4. **Consistency:** The presence of `alloc` in the HEAD version confirms the class uses allocator-aware patterns, making the allocator-based destruction the semantically correct choice.

The resolved version maintains allocator compatibility while achieving identical functional intent.
