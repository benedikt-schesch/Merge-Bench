The merge conflict involves a missing return statement in one branch. The HEAD branch returns 1 after cleanup, while the other branch has no return statement. Since the surrounding context doesn't show the function's return type or full control flow, the intent is ambiguous. 

Resolving would require knowing if:
1. The function should always return a value
2. The cleanup operation changes error-handling requirements
3. The return value affects upstream logic

Without this information, it's unsafe to automatically resolve. The conflict markers are preserved as required.
