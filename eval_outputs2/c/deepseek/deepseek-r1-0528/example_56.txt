I'll help resolve this semantic merge conflict while preserving the surrounding context exactly as provided. The conflict involves different string formatting behaviors for ttymodes display values.

```c
      dlg_update_start(ctrl, dlg);
      dlg_listbox_clear(ctrl, dlg);
      for (val = conf_get_str_strs(conf, CONF_ttymodes, NULL, &key);
           val != NULL;
           val = conf_get_str_strs(conf, CONF_ttymodes, key, &key)) {
        char *disp = dupprintf(
            "%s\t%s",
            key,
            (val[0] == 'A') ? "(auto)"
                            : ((val[0] == 'N') ? "(don't send)" : val + 1));
        dlg_listbox_add(ctrl, dlg, disp);
        sfree(disp);
      }
      dlg_update_done(ctrl, dlg);
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

Resolution rationale:
1. The second branch's implementation is more comprehensive as it handles both:
   - 'A' prefix → "(auto)"
   - 'N' prefix → "(don't send)"
   - Default case → `val + 1`
2. This maintains the HEAD behavior while adding new functionality from the other branch
3. The multi-line formatting is preserved for readability
4. The trailing conflict marker is left intact as requested since it's outside the resolved conflict block and we must preserve context exactly

The resolved code now properly handles all special cases for ttymodes display values while maintaining the original program flow.
