The merge conflict involves a discrepancy in the return statement after handling an unsupported address type. The HEAD branch returns `1`, while the other branch uses `return;`. Without additional context about the function's return type (e.g., `int` vs `void`), it's impossible to determine the correct resolution. Both changes are semantically valid depending on the function's signature, making the intent ambiguous.

Resolved output (conflict preserved):
```c
             * Unknown address type. (FIXME: support IPv6!)
             */
            reply[1] = 8; /* atype not supported */
            sk_write(pf->s, (char *)reply, lenof(reply));
            pfd_close(pf);
<<<<<<< HEAD
