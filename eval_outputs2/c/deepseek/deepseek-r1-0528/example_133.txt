The conflict arises from a variable declaration present in the HEAD branch but absent in the other branch. Since the variable `connopen` might be used in logic specific to the HEAD branch, and its absence could cause compilation errors if required, while its presence is harmless if unused, the safe resolution is to retain it. The resolved code incorporates the variable from HEAD.

```c
  int sending;
  int portnumber = -1;
  int *fdlist;
  int fd;
  int i, fdcount, fdsize, fdstate;
  int connopen;
  int exitcode;
  int errors;
  int use_subsystem = 0;
  int got_host = FALSE;
  int just_test_share_exists = FALSE;
```
