**Reasoning:**  
The conflict involves a critical semantic difference - one branch returns the function's result while the other discards it. Since this impacts control flow (returning vs continuing execution) and we lack context about:
1. The function's expected return behavior
2. Whether callers depend on the return value
3. The surrounding logic after the conflict  

I've preserved the conflict markers as the intent is ambiguous without broader context. Resolving this requires understanding whether the function should exit immediately or continue to the `break` statement.
