The `HEAD` branch adds a variable initialization `open = 1;`, while the other branch has no code in this location. The commit message for the other branch (`4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5`) indicates the removal of an unused variable.

The intent of the incoming change is to clean up dead code. The `do-while` loop that follows correctly handles the socket-draining logic based on the return value of `p_recv` without needing an `open` flag. Therefore, the correct resolution is to accept the deletion of the unused variable.

```c
    if (bufsize_after < bufsize_before)
      plug_sent(s->plug, bufsize_after);
  } break;
  case FD_CLOSE:
    /* Signal a close on the socket. First read any outstanding data. */
    do {
      ret = p_recv(s->s, buf, sizeof(buf), 0);
      if (ret < 0) {
        err = p_WSAGetLastError();
        if (err == WSAEWOULDBLOCK)

```
