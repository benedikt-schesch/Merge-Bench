This is a classic conflict between a bug fix on one branch and a refactoring on another.

*   **`HEAD`'s Intent:** The `HEAD` branch adds `return 1;`. This suggests the function is intended to return an integer (likely `1` for success) and that there was a code path where it wasn't returning anything, which is a bug in C for non-void functions. This is a bug fix.
*   **Commit `4348393...`'s Intent:** This branch removes the return statement. Looking at the broader context of that commit, its purpose was to refactor the plugin interface, changing this function's signature to return `void`. In a `void` function, a `return 1;` statement is a compile error.

**Resolution:** The refactoring to a `void` function is the more significant, forward-looking change. The bug that `HEAD` fixes is on an old function signature that no longer exists after the refactoring. Therefore, we should adopt the change from the refactoring branch, which means the function should not have a return statement.

```c
  if (sshfwd_write(xconn->c, data, len) > 0) {
    xconn->throttled = 1;
    xconn->no_data_sent_to_x_client = FALSE;
    sk_set_frozen(xconn->s, 1);
  }
}

static void x11_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  struct X11Connection *xconn = (struct X11Connection *)plug;

```
