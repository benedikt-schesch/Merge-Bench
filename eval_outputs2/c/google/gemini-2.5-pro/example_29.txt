In a software-defined networking context where a device can act as an advanced switch (sometimes called a layer-3 switch or brouter), it's plausible that it would need to manage both layer-2 MAC address tables and layer-3 subnet information.

- The `HEAD` branch adds a call to `age_mac()`, a standard function for a switch to time out old entries in its MAC address table.
- The other branch adds a call to `age_subnets()`, which suggests the switch also has some awareness of subnets that needs to be periodically maintained.

These two functions appear to be independent maintenance tasks, both relevant when `routing_mode` is `RMODE_SWITCH`. There is no indication that one should replace the other. The most sensible resolution is to combine both changes, ensuring both MAC addresses and subnet information are aged out as intended by both developers.

```c
		if(last_ping_check + pingtimeout < now) {
			check_dead_connections();
			last_ping_check = now;

			if(routing_mode == RMODE_SWITCH) {
				age_mac();
				age_subnets();
			}

			age_past_requests();

			/* Should we regenerate our key? */
