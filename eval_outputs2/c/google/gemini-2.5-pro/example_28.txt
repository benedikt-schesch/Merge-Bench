The `HEAD` branch sets a randomized timeout for the `select` call, with a comment explaining this is to prevent synchronization issues (like the thundering herd problem). The other branch comments out this logic and sets a fixed timeout of 1 second, which was likely done for debugging or testing purposes.

The randomized timeout is a more robust and deliberate design for production environments. The fixed timeout removes this protection. Therefore, the most semantically correct resolution is to keep the version from `HEAD`.

```c
	running = true;

	while(running) {
		now = time(NULL);

		tv.tv_sec = 1 + (rand() & 7);	/* Approx. 5 seconds, randomized to prevent global synchronisation effects */
		tv.tv_usec = 0;

		maxfd = build_fdset(&fset);

		r = select(maxfd + 1, &fset, NULL, NULL, &tv);

```
