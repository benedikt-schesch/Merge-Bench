The conflict is over an `$Id$` keyword, which is automatically updated by a version control system like CVS. These keywords track the file's name, version, last modification date, and last author.

The intent on both sides is simply to have the VCS record the latest version information. The incoming change (`1.9.4.73`) is from a later date (`2003/12/20`) than the `HEAD` version (`1.13`, `2003/08/24`). Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the version with the more recent timestamp, as it reflects the latest state of the file from the branch being merged.
