The `HEAD` branch attempts to return a value from both the `if` block and the code path outside the `if` block. However, one of these paths involves `return plug_receive(...)`, but the standard `plug_receive` function in this type of interface is a `void` function, meaning it doesn't return a value. This makes the code in `HEAD` logically and syntactically incorrect.

The other branch (`4348393f...`) refactors the logic into a clear `if-else` block. It calls `ps->negotiate(...)` and `plug_receive(...)` for their side effects, discarding any return value. This is consistent with a `void` parent function, which aligns with the fact that `plug_receive` is `void`.

The intent of both branches is to either handle the data via the proxy negotiation logic or pass it down to the underlying plug. The `4348393f...` branch implements this intent correctly and robustly. Therefore, we will adopt the changes from that branch.

```c
     */
    bufchain_add(&ps->pending_input_data, data, len);
    ps->receive_urgent = urgent;
    ps->receive_data = data;
    ps->receive_len = len;
    ps->negotiate(ps, PROXY_CHANGE_RECEIVE);
  } else {
    plug_receive(ps->plug, urgent, data, len);
  }
}

static void plug_proxy_sent(Plug p, int bufsize)
{
  Proxy_Plug pp = (Proxy_Plug)p;

```
