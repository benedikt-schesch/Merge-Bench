The conflict arises from a function name change, likely due to a code style refactoring. Both `InitCommonControls()` and `init_common_controls()` serve the same purpose of initializing the Windows common controls library. The surrounding code, with function calls like `sk_init()` and `set_explicit_app_user_model_id()`, follows a `snake_case` naming convention. To maintain consistency with the established code style of the project, the `snake_case` version `init_common_controls()` is the correct choice.

```c
  hwnd = NULL;
  flags = FLAG_VERBOSE | FLAG_INTERACTIVE;

  sk_init();

  init_common_controls();

  /* Set Explicit App User Model Id so that jump lists don't cause
     PuTTY to hang on to removable media. */

  set_explicit_app_user_model_id();

```
