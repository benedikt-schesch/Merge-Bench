Based on the semantics of the surrounding C preprocessor directives, here is the resolved merge conflict:

The `HEAD` branch contains a preprocessor check for `ZEND_ENGINE_2_5`, which was used to detect PHP versions older than 5.5, and includes `php_logos.h` accordingly.

The incoming branch (`51c6ba6...`) introduces a more modern and explicit check using `PHP_VERSION_ID < 50500` to achieve the same goal. It also adds includes for `php.h` and `php_ini.h`, which are standard and necessary headers for a PHP extension.

The semantic intent of both branches is to handle compatibility with older PHP versions. The incoming branch does this in a more complete and modern way. Therefore, the resolution is to adopt the changes from the incoming branch and remove the now-redundant `ZEND_ENGINE_2_5` block to avoid duplication of logic.

```c

#include "php.h"
#include "php_ini.h"
#if PHP_VERSION_ID < 50500
   #include "php_logos.h"
#endif
#include "main/fopen_wrappers.h"
#include "ext/standard/info.h"
#include "ext/standard/php_incomplete_class.h"
#include "ext/standard/md5.h"
