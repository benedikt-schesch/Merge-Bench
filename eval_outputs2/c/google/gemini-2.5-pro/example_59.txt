The conflict arises from two different approaches to laying out a UI element for SSH TTY modes. One version places a value box in column 2 and links the default action to an "Add" button, while the other places it in column 1 and links it to a "Set" button.

The `HEAD` version appears to be a correction or refinement of the UI layout. In this context, adding a new TTY mode is the primary action associated with the value input box. The layout also places the value box in the third column (index 2), which is likely the correct position relative to the label and the list of modes. The incoming change seems to be from an earlier refactoring that had a less refined layout. Therefore, the `HEAD` version represents the most complete and correct intent.

```c
                                100,
                                HELPCTX(ssh_ttymodes),
                                ttymodes_handler,
                                P(td),
                                P(NULL));
      td->valbox->generic.column = 2;
      ctrl_tabdelay(s, td->addbutton);
    }

    if (!midsession) {
      /*
       * The Connection/SSH/X11 panel.
