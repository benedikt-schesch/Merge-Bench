An analysis of the two branches suggests the following:

*   **HEAD**: This branch introduces a local variable `ret` and initializes it to `TRUE`. However, this variable is not used anywhere in the visible scope of the function. This is often indicative of incomplete or abandoned refactoring.
*   **`4348393f...`**: This branch does not include the `ret` variable declaration.

The most logical resolution is to remove the unused variable. Declaring a variable that is never read from is dead code and should be removed for clarity and to avoid compiler warnings. The intent to remove (or not add) this unused variable is cleaner and more correct.

```c
}

void pty_select_result(int fd, int event)
{
  Pty pty;

  if (fd == pty_signal_pipe[0]) {
    pid_t pid;
    int status;

```
