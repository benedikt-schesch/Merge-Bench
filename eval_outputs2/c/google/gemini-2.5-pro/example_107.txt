The conflict arises from a change in the return type of the function containing this code. One branch (`4348393f562c...`) refactored the function signature to return `void`, thus removing the `return` statement. The `HEAD` branch keeps the old behavior where the function returned an integer.

The semantic intent of the `4348393f562c...` branch is to align the function's implementation with a broader API change. Therefore, the correct resolution is to remove the `return 1;` statement, as the function no longer returns a value.

```c
  Raw raw = (Raw)plug;
  c_write(raw, data, len);
  /* We count 'session start', for proxy logging purposes, as being
   * when data is received from the network and printed. */
  raw->session_started = TRUE;
}

static void raw_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  Raw raw = (Raw)plug;

```
