Based on the surrounding code, this conflict is happening at the end of a function. The `HEAD` branch includes a `return 1;` statement, while the incoming branch (`4348393f...`) removes it.

The most common reason for such a change is a refactoring of the function's signature. It is highly probable that the incoming branch also changed the function's return type from `int` to `void` because the return value was determined to be unused. In that context, removing the `return 1;` statement is the correct action to prevent a compilation error. Keeping the return statement would be inconsistent with the intent to make the function return `void`.

Therefore, the semantically correct resolution is to accept the removal of the return statement.

```c
  Telnet telnet = (Telnet)plug;
  if (urgent)
    telnet->in_synch = TRUE;
  telnet->session_started = TRUE;
  do_telnet_read(telnet, data, len);
}

static void telnet_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  Telnet telnet = (Telnet)plug;

```
