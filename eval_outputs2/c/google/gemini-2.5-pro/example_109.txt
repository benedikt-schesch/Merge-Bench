Based on the provided snippet, the conflict is about the return statement of a function.

- The `HEAD` version of the code has the function returning `1` at the end. This implies the function has a non-`void` return type, likely `int`, and is signaling a successful execution.
- The `4348393f562c...` version has no return statement. This suggests a change in the function's signature to have a `void` return type. Such a change is common during API refactoring, where a callback's return value is found to be unused and is removed for simplification.

The semantic intent of `4348393f562c...` appears to be a deliberate refactoring of the function's interface, changing its return type to `void`. To be consistent with this refactoring, the `return 1;` statement must be removed. The `HEAD` version represents the older state of the code before this refactoring. When merging, the refactoring should be accepted.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to remove the `return 1;` statement, aligning with the change to a `void` return type.

```c
      rlogin->firstbyte = 0;
    }
    if (len > 0)
      c_write(rlogin, data, len);
  }
}

static void rlogin_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  Rlogin rlogin = (Rlogin)plug;

```
