This is a merge conflict on a version control system keyword, likely from an older system like CVS. These `$Id$` keywords are automatically expanded by the version control system on each commit to include metadata like the filename, revision number, date, and author of the last change.

The conflict arises because the file was modified on both branches being merged, causing the `$Id$` keyword to be updated differently on each side.

*   `HEAD` shows revision `1.14` from August 24, 2003.
*   The other branch shows revision `1.9.4.77` from December 12, 2003.

The semantic intent of this line is to track the file's latest version information. Since the commit from December 12, 2003 is more recent, it is the most up-to-date piece of historical information before this merge. Therefore, the resolution will be to keep the version with the later timestamp.
