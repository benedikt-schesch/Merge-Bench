The `HEAD` side of the conflict is empty, meaning no changes were made at this location. The `d7c8f2a...` side introduces a new "pre-initialization" hook. This hook allows for an optional, platform-specific function (`gpio_init_pre`) to run before the main GPIO initialization logic. If this pre-initialization step fails, the entire function aborts early.

The intents do not conflict. One side does nothing, while the other adds a new, self-contained feature at the beginning of the function. The correct semantic resolution is to incorporate the new feature.

The `printf` statement appears to be for debugging but is included in the incoming change. A safe merge preserves this, as its removal would be a separate refactoring step.

```c
}

mraa_gpio_context
mraa_gpio_init_raw(int pin)
{
    if (advance_func.gpio_init_pre != NULL) {
        printf("Actually entering\n");
        if (advance_func.gpio_init_pre(pin) != MRAA_SUCCESS)
            return NULL;
    }
    if (pin < 0)
        return NULL;

    char bu[MAX_SIZE];
    int length;
