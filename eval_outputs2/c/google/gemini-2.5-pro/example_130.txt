An expert in semantic merge conflict resolution would analyze the intent of both changes.

*   **`HEAD`'s Intent:** If an error occurs, call `plug_closing` and immediately return its result, propagating the error status. If there's no error but the connection isn't complete yet (asynchronous operation), return `0` to signal "in progress, no error". This suggests the function returns an integer status.
*   **`4348393f...`'s Intent:** If an error occurs, call `plug_closing` but don't return its value. Then, if not connected, `return;`. This suggests the function returns `void`.

**Resolution:**
The `HEAD` version is semantically superior and more robust. It's common for functions performing I/O operations to return a status code. `HEAD` properly propagates the error code from `plug_closing`. The `return 0;` for the asynchronous case is also a standard pattern for a function returning an integer, indicating success or a non-error state. The other branch's logic feels incomplete, as it calls `plug_closing` but discards its potentially useful return value.

Therefore, the `HEAD` version is the correct resolution.

```c

          while (err && s->addr && sk_nextaddr(s->addr, &s->step)) {
            err = try_connect(s);
          }
          if (err)
            return plug_closing(s->plug, strerror(err), err, 0);
          if (!s->connected)
            return 0; /* another async attempt in progress */
        }
      }

      /*
       * If we get here, we've managed to make a connection.

```
