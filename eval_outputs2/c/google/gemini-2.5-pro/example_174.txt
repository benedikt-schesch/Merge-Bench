This merge conflict arises from a refactoring of coroutine macros. The goal of this refactoring was to create two distinct sets of macros: one for coroutines that return a value, and another for `void` coroutines.

*   The `HEAD` branch uses `crFinish(1);`. This is the macro for a coroutine that returns a value (`int` in this case), and it is returning `1`.
*   The `434839...` branch uses `crFinishV;`. This is the macro for a coroutine that returns `void`.

According to the commit message associated with the refactoring, this specific coroutine (`pageant_main_coroutine`) is intended to return an `int`. Therefore, using the value-returning macro `crFinish(1)` is the correct semantic choice. Using `crFinishV` would be a bug where a non-void function fails to return a value.

```c
      sk_write(pc->connsock, reply, replylen);
      smemclr(reply, replylen);
    }
  }

  crFinish(1);
}

struct pageant_listen_state {
  const struct plug_function_table *fn;
  /* the above variable absolutely *must* be the first in this structure */

```
