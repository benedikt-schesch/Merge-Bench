This merge conflict involves one branch adding `connopen = 1;` and another branch having this line absent.

The code snippet appears to be the success path of a connection-handling function. After successfully setting up the connection context (`back->provide_logctx`) and cleaning up temporary data (`sfree(realhost)`), it is semantically correct to set a flag indicating that the connection is now open. The `connopen = 1;` line explicitly serves this purpose.

The removal of this line by the other branch is likely an error or part of an incomplete refactoring, as it would leave the connection state unmarked. Therefore, the resolution is to keep the line, as it clearly represents the intent to flag a successful connection.

```c
      return 1;
    }
    back->provide_logctx(backhandle, logctx);
    sfree(realhost);
  }
  connopen = 1;

  inhandle = GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE);
  outhandle = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
  errhandle = GetStdHandle(STD_ERROR_HANDLE);
