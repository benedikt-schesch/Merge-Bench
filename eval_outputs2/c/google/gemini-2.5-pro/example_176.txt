This merge conflict arises from a refactoring effort.

*   The `HEAD` branch preserves the original behavior where the function returns an integer (`int`), with `1` likely indicating an error or that the operation is complete.
*   The other branch (`4348393f...`) is part of a change set that refactors this function to return `void`. In this model, the function handles its own error reporting and cleanup and does not need to return a status code to the caller.

The semantic intent of the `4348393f...` branch is to change the function's contract. Assuming the goal of the merge is to incorporate this refactoring, the correct resolution is to use the `void` return. Both branches perform the same actions before returning (sending a rejection message and closing the socket); they only differ in the return value. Adopting the `void` return aligns with the deliberate refactoring.

```c
          char data[8];
          memset(data, 0, sizeof(data));
          data[1] = 91; /* generic `request rejected' */
          sk_write(pf->s, data, 8);
          pfd_close(pf);
          return;
        }
        if (pf->sockslen <= 8)
          continue; /* haven't started user/hostname */
        if (pf->socksbuf[pf->sockslen - 1] != 0)
          continue; /* haven't _finished_ user/hostname */

```
