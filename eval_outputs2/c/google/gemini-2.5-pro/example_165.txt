Based on the commit message associated with one side of the conflict (`4348393f...`), which is "Removed an unused variable," the clear semantic intent is to clean up the code by removing a variable that is no longer used. The other side of the conflict simply retains this unused variable. The correct resolution is to accept the cleanup and remove the variable declaration.

```c
                      (HANDLE, LPVOID, DWORD, LPDWORD));

static void init_winfuncs(void)
{
  static int initialised = FALSE;
  if (initialised)
    return;
  {
    HMODULE winspool_module = load_system32_dll("winspool.drv");

```
