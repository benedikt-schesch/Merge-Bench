The conflict arises because one branch has added a security-conscious pre-loading of a DLL, while the other branch has no changes. The intent of the incoming change (`fc089d5df72a...`) is to prevent a potential DLL-hijacking vulnerability on Windows systems where MIT Kerberos is installed. This is achieved by explicitly loading `sspicli.dll` from the secure `system32` directory before a function is called that might otherwise load it from an insecure path.

This change is a clear improvement and does not conflict with the logic of the original code. The resolution is to incorporate the added code.

```c
  {
    static int tried_usernameex = FALSE;
    if (!tried_usernameex) {
      /* Not available on Win9x, so load dynamically */
      HMODULE secur32 = load_system32_dll("secur32.dll");
      /* If MIT Kerberos is installed, the following call to
         GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION makes Windows implicitly load
         sspicli.dll WITHOUT proper path sanitizing, so better
         load it properly before */
      HMODULE sspicli = load_system32_dll("sspicli.dll");
      GET_WINDOWS_FUNCTION(secur32, GetUserNameExA);
      tried_usernameex = TRUE;
    }
  }
