The user wants me to resolve a merge conflict in a C++ code snippet.

**Code Snippet:**
```c
      
      __forceinline CatmullRomCurveT(const Vertex& v0, const Vertex& v1, const Vertex& v2, const Vertex& v3)
        : v0(v0), v1(v1), v2(v2), v3(v3) {}

      __forceinline Vertex begin() const {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        return v0;
=======
        return v1;
>>>>>>> d70beac22b600ac694fcb3b93d35f2a672cd0673
      }

      __forceinline Vertex end() const {
        return v2;
      }

```

### Analysis of the Conflict

1.  **Context**: The code defines a `CatmullRomCurveT` class. A Catmull-Rom curve segment is defined by four control points. Let's call them P0, P1, P2, and P3. The curve itself is interpolated *between* P1 and P2. P0 and P3 are used to define the tangents at P1 and P2, but they are not part of the rendered segment. In this class, the points are named `v0`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`.

2.  **`end()` Method**: The `end()` method consistently returns `v2`. This strongly implies that `v2` is considered the end point of the curve segment.

3.  **`begin()` Method**:
    *   The `HEAD` version returns `v0`.
    *   The `d70...` version returns `v1`.

4.  **Semantic Intent**: Given that a Catmull-Rom curve segment travels from P1 to P2, the semantically correct starting point of the curve is `v1`. The point `v0` is an external control point that influences the curve's shape at its beginning but is not the beginning itself. Since the `end()` method returns `v2`, it is logical that the `begin()` method should return `v1`.

5.  **Resolution**: The change from the `d70...` branch (`return v1;`) is the correct one, as it aligns with the standard definition of a Catmull-Rom curve segment and is consistent with the implementation of the `end()` method.

### Resolved Code

```c
      
      __forceinline CatmullRomCurveT(const Vertex& v0, const Vertex& v1, const Vertex& v2, const Vertex& v3)
        : v0(v0), v1(v1), v2(v2), v3(v3) {}

      __forceinline Vertex begin() const {
        return v1;
      }

      __forceinline Vertex end() const {
        return v2;
      }

```
