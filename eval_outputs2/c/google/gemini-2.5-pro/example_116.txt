An analysis of the conflict suggests that the two branches are making conflicting changes inside an error-handling function. The `HEAD` branch adds a `return 1;` statement, which is a common pattern for indicating that an error has been handled. The other branch, `4348393f562c...`, removes this return statement.

Looking at the likely evolution of this code (specifically in the PuTTY project, where this code originates), the function signature was probably changed from returning an `int` to returning `void`. The change in the `4348393f562c...` branch is to remove the `return` statement to align with the new `void` return type, likely to fix a compiler warning. The `HEAD` branch's change is therefore incompatible with the function's new contract.

The correct semantic merge is to accept the removal of the return statement, as the function no longer returns a value.

```c
  struct ssh_sharing_state *sharestate = (struct ssh_sharing_state *)plug;
  if (error_msg)
    ssh_sharing_logf(sharestate->ssh, 0, "listening socket: %s", error_msg);
  sk_close(sharestate->listensock);
  sharestate->listensock = NULL;
}

static void share_send_verstring(struct ssh_sharing_connstate *cs)
{
  char *fullstring = dupcat("SSHCONNECTION@putty.projects.tartarus.org-2.0-",
