The merge conflict is between a version that explicitly casts a `void*` and one that relies on C's implicit conversion. In C, casting `void*` is not necessary and often discouraged as it can hide other programming errors. However, it is required in C++.

The intent of the `HEAD` change is to add an explicit cast to `(event_t *)`. This is a deliberate action, often done to improve code clarity, satisfy stricter compiler warnings (e.g., when compiling with C++ compatibility flags), or as a matter of coding style. The other branch represents the more common C idiom of omitting the cast.

Since adding the cast is an explicit, non-harmful change that may be required by the project's specific build environment or coding standards, it's safer to keep it. It resolves any potential compiler warnings and makes the type conversion explicit.

```c

		if(sigalrm) {
			logger(LOG_INFO, _("Flushing event queue"));

			while(event_tree->head) {
				event = (event_t *) event_tree->head->data;
				event->handler(event->data);
				event_del(event);
			}
			sigalrm = false;
		}

```
