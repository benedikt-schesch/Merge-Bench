Both sides are calling `pty_real_select_result` when a `pty` is found. The `HEAD` version also captures the boolean return value from this function call and combines it with the existing `ret` variable. The code just above the conflict, inside the `do-while` loop, uses the same `ret = ret && ...` pattern. This indicates a consistent intent to aggregate the success of all `pty_real_select_result` calls. The `HEAD` version correctly implements this intent for the `else` branch as well, while the other version omits it. Therefore, the `HEAD` version is the correct resolution.

```c
    } while (pid > 0);
  } else {
    pty = find234(ptys_by_fd, &fd, pty_find_by_fd);

    if (pty)
      ret = ret && pty_real_select_result(pty, event, 0);
  }

  return ret;
}

static void pty_uxsel_setup(Pty pty)
{
  int rwx;

```
