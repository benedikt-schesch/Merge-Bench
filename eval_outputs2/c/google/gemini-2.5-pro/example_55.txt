An analysis of the conflict within the `ttymodes_data` struct suggests that two different sets of features were being developed for managing TTY modes.

*   The `HEAD` branch adds controls for `addbutton` and `rembutton`, suggesting a user interface for adding and removing TTY modes from a list. It also includes a `modelist` pointer.
*   The incoming branch (`fc089d5...`) adds a `setbutton`, which implies functionality to apply or "set" a TTY mode, likely from a selection.

The most logical resolution is to combine these features, as they are not mutually exclusive. The ability to add/remove modes (`addbutton`, `rembutton`) and the ability to apply a selected mode (`setbutton`) can coexist to create a more feature-rich dialog.

The merged code will include the pointers from both branches, preserving the structure from the `HEAD` branch and integrating the new `setbutton` pointer.

```c
    }
  }
}

struct ttymodes_data {
  union control *modelist, *valradio, *valbox;
  union control *addbutton, *rembutton, *setbutton, *listbox;
};

static void ttymodes_handler(union control *ctrl,
                             void *dlg,
                             void *data,
