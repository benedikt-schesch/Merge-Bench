Resolving this merge conflict requires understanding the intent behind the changes. The `HEAD` branch declares an integer variable `j`, while the incoming branch `4348393f562c...` does not. Looking at the surrounding code, the other variables `i` and `ivlen` are common to both branches and are clearly intended to be used within the block.

The most common reason for a conflict like this is that one branch has removed a variable that is no longer used. The incoming change likely includes a refactoring that made `j` obsolete. Keeping an unused variable is generally undesirable. Therefore, the most semantically correct resolution is to accept the change that removes the declaration of `j`, as it represents a cleaner state of the code.

```c
        }
        p += 2;
        if (!strcmp(p, "ENCRYPTED"))
          ret->encrypted = TRUE;
      } else if (!strcmp(line, "DEK-Info")) {
        int i, ivlen;

        if (!strncmp(p, "DES-EDE3-CBC,", 13)) {
          ret->encryption = OP_E_3DES;
          ivlen = 8;
        } else if (!strncmp(p, "AES-128-CBC,", 12)) {
