An analysis of the conflict reveals two separate changes:

1.  **Type Casting:** The `HEAD` branch explicitly casts `nnode->data` (which is likely a `void*`) to a `node_t*`, while the `af86a32...` branch relies on C's implicit `void*` conversion. The explicit cast `(node_t*)` in `HEAD` is a deliberate change that improves code clarity and type safety, making the programmer's intent obvious. This is generally considered better practice.
2.  **Trailing Whitespace:** The second conflict marker `<<<<<<< HEAD` at the end of the snippet indicates a conflict over a blank line. The `HEAD` branch contains a blank line, while the other branch (whose `=======` and `>>>>>>>` markers are not shown in the snippet) likely contains nothing.

The most logical resolution is to accept both changes from the `HEAD` branch, as they appear to be part of a single effort to improve code style and clarity. This involves using the explicit cast and keeping the trailing blank line.

```c

	/* Check if anyone else claims to have an edge to an unreachable node. If not, delete node. */

	for(nnode = node_tree->head; nnode; nnode = nnext) {
		nnext = nnode->next;
		n = (node_t *) nnode->data;

		if(!n->status.reachable) {
			for(enode = edge_weight_tree->head; enode; enode = enext) {
				enext = enode->next;

```
