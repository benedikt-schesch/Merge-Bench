This merge conflict arises from a change in the function signature of the enclosing function, which is likely a `closing` callback for a network socket.

*   **HEAD** retains a `return 1;` statement. This is characteristic of an older version of the PuTTY `Plug` interface where the `closing` callback was expected to return an `int`.
*   **Commit `4348393f...`** removes this return statement. This corresponds to a codebase-wide refactoring where the signature of the `closing` callback was changed from `int (*)(...)` to `void (*)(...)`. Returning a value from a `void` function is a compilation error.

The semantic intent of the `4348393f...` branch is to adapt the function to the newer, `void`-returning API. This is the correct path forward, as it aligns with the evolution of the surrounding framework. Therefore, the `return 1;` statement should be removed.

```c
  struct pageant_listen_state *pl = (struct pageant_listen_state *)plug;
  if (error_msg)
    plog(pl->logctx, pl->logfn, "listening socket: error: %s", error_msg);
  sk_close(pl->listensock);
  pl->listensock = NULL;
}

static int pageant_listen_accepting(Plug plug,
                                    accept_fn_t constructor,
                                    accept_ctx_t ctx)

```
