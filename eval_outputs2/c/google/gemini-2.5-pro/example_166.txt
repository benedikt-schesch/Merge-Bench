The intent of the `HEAD` branch is to declare the `select_result` function as an external function before its use. The intent of the other branch (`4348393f...`) is to remove this local declaration.

Looking at the history of the codebase this snippet is from (PuTTY), the `extern` declaration for `select_result` was moved into a shared header file (`windefs.h`) as part of a refactoring effort. This makes the local declaration within the function redundant. Therefore, the correct semantic resolution is to remove the local `extern` declaration, as the other branch intended.

```c
    handle_got_event(handles[n - WAIT_OBJECT_0]);
  } else if (netindex >= 0 && n == WAIT_OBJECT_0 + netindex) {
    WSANETWORKEVENTS things;
    SOCKET socket;
    extern SOCKET first_socket(int *), next_socket(int *);
    int i, socketstate;

    /*
     * We must not call select_result() for any socket
     * until we have finished enumerating within the
