An analysis of the two branches indicates two different approaches to handling the `plug_receive` function call.

*   The `HEAD` branch explicitly returns the value from the `plug_receive` call. This suggests that the enclosing function has a non-`void` return type and is expected to propagate the status of the `plug_receive` operation to its caller. This is a common pattern for event handlers, where the return value might signal whether to continue, close the connection, or indicate an error.
*   The other branch (`4348393f...`) calls `plug_receive` but discards its return value. After the call, control flow breaks from the `switch` case. This implies that the function is called only for its side effects, and its return value is not considered important in this context.

The addition of the `return` keyword in `HEAD` appears to be a deliberate enhancement or bug fix. It makes the control flow more robust by ensuring the result of the data receive operation is handled by the calling function. Ignoring the return value, as the other branch does, could potentially hide errors or important status changes. Therefore, preserving the `return` statement is the most semantically sound resolution.

```c
      /* We're inside the Windows frontend here, so we know
       * that the frontend handle is unnecessary. */
      logevent(NULL, str);
      fatalbox("%s", str);
    } else {
      return plug_receive(s->plug, 2, buf, ret);
    }
    break;
  case FD_WRITE: {
    int bufsize_before, bufsize_after;
    s->writable = 1;

```
