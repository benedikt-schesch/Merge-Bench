The conflict arises from two different approaches to handling the return value of the function containing this code block.

-   The `HEAD` branch ensures the function returns a value of `1` in this path, and also adds a fall-through `return 1` at the end of the function. This suggests the function is expected to return an integer, possibly to indicate success or that the event was handled.
-   The `4348393f...` branch removes the `return` statement entirely. This implies a larger refactoring where the function's signature was likely changed from `int func(...)` to `void func(...)`, because its return value was determined to be unused by any callers.

The more significant and intentional change is the refactoring to a `void` return type, which simplifies the code by removing an unnecessary return value. Therefore, the resolution is to accept the change from the `4348393f...` branch.

```c
    }
  } else if (event == 2) {
    assert(fd == s->to_cmd);
    if (localproxy_try_send(s))
      plug_sent(s->plug, bufchain_size(&s->pending_output_data));
  }
}
