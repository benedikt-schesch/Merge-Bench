This is a trivial merge conflict on a version control system (VCS) keyword. The `$Id$` tag is automatically updated by older VCS systems like CVS or RCS upon each commit, recording the file name, revision number, date, and author.

During a merge, both the `HEAD` (the current branch, likely the main branch) and the branch being merged have their own version of this line, leading to a conflict.

*   **`HEAD`'s intent:** To record the file's version on the main branch, which is `1.40`.
*   **The other branch's intent:** To record the file's version on the feature/development branch, which is `1.35.4.203`.

The semantically correct resolution is to acknowledge that the merged file represents a new version that succeeds the version on the branch you are merging *into* (`HEAD`). By keeping the `HEAD` version, the version history within the file remains more coherent. Upon committing the merge, the VCS would in any case update this line to the new version number (e.g., `1.41`).
