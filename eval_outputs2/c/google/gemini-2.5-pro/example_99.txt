This merge conflict arises from a change in the signature or an improvement in the implementation of the `dupvprintf_inner` function.

*   The `HEAD` version calls `dupvprintf_inner` passing the buffer size `buf->size` by value. This implies that if `dupvprintf_inner` reallocates the buffer to a larger size, it cannot update the `size` member of the `strbuf` struct, leading to an inconsistent state.
*   The `fc089d5df72a9...` version passes a pointer to the buffer size, `&buf->size`. This is the semantically correct approach, as it allows `dupvprintf_inner` to modify `buf->size` to reflect the new allocated capacity if a reallocation occurs. This prevents potential buffer overflows or memory management bugs later on.

The version passing the size by pointer is a clear improvement and likely a bug fix. Therefore, it is the correct version to keep.

```c
  sfree(buf);
  return ret;
}
void strbuf_catfv(strbuf *buf, const char *fmt, va_list ap)
{
  buf->s = dupvprintf_inner(buf->s, buf->len, &buf->size, fmt, ap);
  buf->len += strlen(buf->s + buf->len);
}
void strbuf_catf(strbuf *buf, const char *fmt, ...)
{
  va_list ap;

```
