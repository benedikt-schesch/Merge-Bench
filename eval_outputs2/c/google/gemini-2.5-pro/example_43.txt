This type of conflict occurs in a metadata tag auto-generated by a version control system (in this case, likely CVS or SVN). The `$Id$` tag records the filename, revision number, date, and author of the last commit for that file.

*   **HEAD:** Represents version `1.32`, last modified on `2003/08/24`.
*   **Incoming Change:** Represents version `1.28.4.148`, last modified on `2003/11/17`.

The intent of both sides is simply to have this line reflect the file's version information. During a merge, it's best to pick the version with the most recent timestamp, as it reflects the latest change. Here, the incoming change is from November, while the HEAD is from August.

Upon the next commit (the merge commit), the version control system will automatically update this line with the new version information anyway. The correct resolution is to choose one, and the most logical one is from the more recent change.
