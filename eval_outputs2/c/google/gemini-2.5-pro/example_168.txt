This merge conflict arises from a change in the return type of the function containing the conflict.

*   **The `HEAD` branch** expects the function to return an integer value (`return 1;`), likely to indicate success.
*   **The `4348393f562c...` branch** removes the return statement, indicating that the function's signature has been changed to `void`. This is a common refactoring to simplify an API where the return value was consistently unused or always a success value.

Given the surrounding code, especially the `void` return type of the subsequent function `x11_receive`, it is highly probable that the function containing the conflict was part of a broader API change to use `void` return types for functions that don't need to signal failure. Therefore, the semantically correct resolution is to remove the `return` statement.

```c
     * channel.
     */
    if (xconn->c)
      sshfwd_write_eof(xconn->c);
  }
}

static void x11_receive(Plug plug, int urgent, char *data, int len)
{
  struct X11Connection *xconn = (struct X11Connection *)plug;

```
