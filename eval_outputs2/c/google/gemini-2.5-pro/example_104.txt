This conflict arises from changing the format specifier used to parse timestamps in the SCP protocol.

*   **HEAD** uses `%ld`, which corresponds to a signed `long int`.
*   **The incoming change** uses `%lu`, which corresponds to an `unsigned long int`.

Timestamps, such as modification time (`mtime`) and access time (`atime`), represent seconds since the Unix epoch and are conceptually non-negative. Using an unsigned type (`unsigned long`) is semantically more correct and avoids potential issues with large timestamp values (e.g., the Year 2038 problem on 32-bit systems) being misinterpreted. The change to `%lu` is likely a deliberate correction to align the format specifier with the unsigned nature of the `act->mtime` and `act->atime` variables. Therefore, the incoming change is the correct resolution.

```c
      case 'E':
        back->send(backhandle, "", 1);
        act->action = SCP_SINK_ENDDIR;
        return 0;
      case 'T':
        if (sscanf(act->buf, "%lu %*d %lu %*d", &act->mtime, &act->atime) ==
            2) {
          act->settime = 1;
          back->send(backhandle, "", 1);
          continue; /* go round again */
        }

```
