The conflict arises at the end of a function. The `HEAD` branch includes a `return 0;` statement, implying the function has a non-`void` return type (likely `int`). The other branch has removed this line.

The commit `4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5` which removed the `return` statement has the message "ssh_remote_eof should be void". This indicates a deliberate refactoring to change the function's signature from `int` to `void`, making the `return` statement both unnecessary and incorrect.

The function calls `connection_fatal`, which typically terminates program execution or the current connection, meaning the `return` statement would likely be unreachable code anyway. The semantic intent is to make the function's signature accurately reflect that it does not return a value.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to remove the `return 0;` statement, adopting the change from the incoming branch.

```c

  if (error_msg)
    logevent(error_msg);
  if (!ssh->close_expected || !ssh->clean_exit)
    connection_fatal(ssh->frontend, "%s", error_msg);
}

static void ssh_receive(Plug plug, int urgent, char *data, int len)
{
  Ssh ssh = (Ssh)plug;

```
