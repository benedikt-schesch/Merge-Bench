This merge conflict involves two different strategies for handling a contended spinlock.

*   The `HEAD` side represents a simple and common spinlock implementation. When the initial, fast-path lock attempts fail (`ret` is true), it calls a single "slow path" function, `mm_do_lock_slow`. This function is expected to handle the contention, typically by blocking the thread until the lock can be acquired. Once it returns, the lock is held, the loop terminates, and the function returns successfully. This is a clean and standard approach.

*   The `5921a19...` side adds two operations at the end of the spin-wait loop: `_spinlock_unlock(lock)` and `sched_yield()`. The `sched_yield()` call suggests an intent to make the spin-wait loop "nicer" to the system by yielding the CPU to other threads. However, the `_spinlock_unlock(lock)` call is highly problematic. A thread should only unlock a lock that it currently holds. In this context, the thread is spinning precisely because it has failed to acquire the lock, so calling unlock is almost certainly a bug that could corrupt the lock's state.

Given the likely bug in the `5921a19...` branch, the safest and most logical resolution is to adopt the `HEAD` version. The code in `HEAD` is a correct and well-understood pattern for lock implementation, whereas the code added in the other branch is ambiguous and contains a probable defect. The intent of `HEAD` is clear and correct, while the intent of the other side is implemented in a way that is dangerous. Therefore, we resolve the conflict by accepting the `HEAD` version, which omits the problematic additions.

```c

        if (ret) {
            /* Still no luck, try the slow approach */
            mm_do_lock_slow(&lock->locked);
        }
    }
    return 1;
}

static void mm_do_lock_slow(volatile unsigned int* locked)

```
