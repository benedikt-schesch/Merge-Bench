The conflict arises in what appears to be a network data callback function.

- The `HEAD` branch modifies the function to return a status. It returns `0` if the SSH connection was closed after processing the data, and `1` otherwise. This suggests a change in the function's contract to inform the caller whether the connection is still alive.
- The `4348393f...` branch simply adds logic to close the connection if its state becomes `SSH_STATE_CLOSED`, without changing the function's return behavior.

The intent of `HEAD` is to both handle the close logic and to signal the outcome to the caller. This is a superset of the intent of the other branch. The most logical resolution is to adopt the changes from `HEAD`, as it incorporates the necessary close logic while also fulfilling the new requirement of returning a status.

```c
{
  Ssh ssh = (Ssh)plug;
  ssh_gotdata(ssh, (unsigned char *)data, len);
  if (ssh->state == SSH_STATE_CLOSED) {
    ssh_do_close(ssh, TRUE);
    return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}

static void ssh_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  Ssh ssh = (Ssh)plug;

```
