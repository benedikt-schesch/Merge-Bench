In C, a function that is declared to return a value (e.g., `int`) must have a `return` statement on all possible execution paths. Falling off the end of such a function without returning a value results in undefined behavior.

*   **The `HEAD` side's intent:** This change adds `return 1;` at the end of the function. This is a defensive programming practice to ensure that if no other `return` statement is hit within the function's logic, a default value (often indicating success or "handled") is returned, thus preventing undefined behavior.

*   **The other side's intent:** This change removes the `return 1;`. The developer might have thought this code path was unreachable, or they may have been in the middle of a refactoring where the function's return semantics were changing and forgot to add a new `return` statement or change the function signature to `void`.

**Resolution:**
The most semantically correct and safe resolution is to keep the `return 1;`. It prevents a common and potentially serious bug (undefined behavior). Omitting the `return` statement is almost certainly an error unless the function's signature is `void`, which is unlikely in this context. Therefore, accepting the `HEAD` branch is the correct approach.

```c
    } else if (plug_accepting(s->plug, sk_tcp_accept, actx)) {
      p_closesocket(t); /* denied or error */
    }
  }
  }

  return 1;
}

/*
 * Special error values are returned from sk_namelookup and sk_new
 * if there's a problem. These functions extract an error message,
