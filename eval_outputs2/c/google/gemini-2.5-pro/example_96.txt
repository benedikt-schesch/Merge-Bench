When resolving a merge conflict, it's crucial to understand the semantic intent of the changes on both sides.

### Analysis of the Conflict

*   **`HEAD` Branch's Intent:** In this version, if the `vsnprintf` call is successful (meaning the formatted string fits into the provided buffer), the code does nothing further inside the `if` block and simply proceeds to `return buf;`. The intent is a straightforward success path with no side effects on caller-owned size variables. This often occurs during a refactoring where state management is simplified or moved elsewhere (e.g., into a struct that holds the buffer and its size).

*   **`fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5` Branch's Intent:** This version attempts to update a size variable, passed by reference as `*oldsize`, before returning. The intent is to communicate a change in size back to the caller. However, the implementation `*oldsize = newsize;` is problematic because `newsize` is an undefined variable in the provided snippet. This suggests the change is either incomplete, part of a larger change not fully included in the conflict, or contains a typo. This is most likely a "modify/delete" conflict where `HEAD` has refactored the code (deleting the line), while the feature branch modified the old code.

### Resolution

The code from the `fc089d...` branch is not syntactically correct on its own due to the undefined `newsize` variable. This strongly indicates that it should not be included as is.

The most logical resolution is to favor the `HEAD` branch. This assumes that `HEAD` represents a newer state of the code where the need to manually update an external size variable in this manner has been refactored away. Keeping the `HEAD` version results in clean, compilable, and semantically coherent code: on success, the function simply returns the buffer.

```c
    len = vsnprintf(buf + oldlen, size, fmt, ap);
#endif
    if (len >= 0 && len < size) {
      /* This is the C99-specified criterion for snprintf to have
       * been completely successful. */
      return buf;
    } else if (len > 0) {
      /* This is the C99 error condition: the returned length is
       * the required buffer size not counting the NUL. */
      size = len + 1;

```
