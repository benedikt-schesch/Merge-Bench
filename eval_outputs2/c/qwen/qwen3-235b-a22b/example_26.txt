The provided code snippet has a conflict only in the `$Id$` line, which contains version control metadata. Both sides of the merge have identical subsequent content (`#include "system.h"` and `#include <openssl/rand.h>`), indicating that the actual code does not conflict. 

The `$Id$` line typically expands automatically in version control systems (such as CVS), and its content reflects the file's version, modification date, and branch. In this case:

- The `HEAD` version shows `1.40` from August 24, 2003
- The merged branch shows `1.35.4.203` from December 20, 2003

This suggests that the branch has a more recent update, but the intent regarding this line — whether it should reflect the version from the main branch or the merged branch — is ambiguous without further context. Additionally, the line is typically managed by the version control system rather than by manual merge decisions.

---

Since the intent behind the `$Id$` line is unclear, and modifying it could introduce errors (e.g., referencing an incorrect revision or branch), **no resolution should be applied**, and the conflict should be preserved as-is to be resolved outside the code-based merge process.

Here is the full snippet with the conflict unmodified:
