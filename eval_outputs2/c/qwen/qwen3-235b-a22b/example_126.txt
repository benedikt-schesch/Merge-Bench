Certainly! Given the ambiguity in the code snippet around the actual **intent** and **semantics** without access to the full function definition (in particular, whether the function returns `void` or `int`), it is impossible to determine definitively which path to take.

- The `HEAD` version explicitly returns `0`, implying the function likely has a return type of `int`, and the return statement has semantic value.
- The `4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5` version removes the return, possibly because the function signature was changed to `void`, or the value is no longer needed.

Since the function return type isn't visible, and thus the **intent** remains unclear, the correct action per your instruction is to preserve the conflict untouched.

Here is the **exact same snippet plus its full original surrounding context** in markdown code block format:

```c
   * clean up. (Of course we don't free retbuf, since ownership
   * of that passes to the callback.)
   */
  conn->callback(conn->callback_ctx, conn->retbuf, conn->retlen);
  agent_cancel_query(conn);
