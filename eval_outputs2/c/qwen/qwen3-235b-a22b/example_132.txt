The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict in the definition of the function `x11_receive`. On the one hand, the `HEAD` version defines the function to return an `int` and includes a `return 0;` statement, which implies that the function may be used in a context where a return value (possibly an error or status code) is expected. On the other hand, the merged version from commit `4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5` changes the return type to `void`, inherently indicating that this function no longer returns a value.

These two definitions are semantically incompatible: one returns an integer while the other returns nothing. This change could imply that the function's return value is no longer used elsewhere in the codebase, or perhaps that the return value was an unnecessary vestige and was removed to clean up the code.

However, with no additional context regarding the use of this functionâ€™s return value in the larger codebase, or the motivation for this differing change in intent, it is not possible to confidently assert which version is correct or what the actual intended behavior is. Therefore, based on the instructions, and because the semantic intent of both sides is ambiguous and incompatible, the conflict **remains unresolved** and should be addressed by the developer with knowledge of the larger context.

Here is the full snippet as requested, preserved with its existing merge conflict markers and spacing:
