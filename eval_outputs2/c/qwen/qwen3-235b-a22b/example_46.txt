The code snippet contains a merge conflict in the version identifier (`$Id$`) lines. Both sides of the merge appear to represent different branches or versions of the same file, with timestamps and version numbers indicating divergence. Since the `$Id$` marker typically reflects version-control metadata (not affecting the semantics of the code itself) and the surrounding context (license header, header guards) is unaffected and consistent, the core semantic intent of the file remains intact. However, the intent behind which version identifier should take precedence is ambiguous without additional context about branch policies or the purpose of the merge. Therefore, the conflict cannot be resolved automatically based on semantic intent alone.
