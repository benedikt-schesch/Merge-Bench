The merge conflict in the provided code snippet arises within the function `pty_select_result`. The divergence is in whether to declare and initialize the variable `ret` (`int ret = TRUE;`) or to proceed directly to the declaration of `Pty pty;`. Without further information about how the rest of the code uses the `ret` variable—such as whether it is returned, modified, or used in conditional logic—there is insufficient context to semantically resolve this conflict safely.

Since this is a semantic merge, and the intent is ambiguous due to missing visibility into how `ret` is used (or not used) in the continuation of the function from either branch, we must conservatively return the snippet unchanged, preserving the merge conflict markers exactly as provided, without modifying or guessing at the surrounding context.

Here is the code snippet in markdown syntax as requested:

```c
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

void pty_select_result(int fd, int event)
{
<<<<<<< HEAD
  int ret = TRUE;
=======
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
  Pty pty;

  if (fd == pty_signal_pipe[0]) {
    pid_t pid;
    int status;
```

--- 

**Summary:**  
Because `ret` is not referenced in the visible portion of the snippet and its further usage is unknown, we have no basis for resolving the merge conflict semantically. Therefore, we return the original conflicting snippet without modification.
