The provided code snippet appears to contain a merge conflict at the boundary of a conditional block and the termination of a function. Based on the conflict structure:

- The `HEAD` branch retains the unconditional return `return 1;` **after** the conditional block, followed by closing the function body.
- The branch pointed to by `4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5` appears to prematurely close the function and immediately begin the definition of a new function, `static void x11_sent(...)`, directly following a closing brace.

---

### Semantic Intent Analysis

**HEAD Changes:**
- The `return 1;` line indicates the path to exit the function and return success unconditionally (regardless of whether the `if` block executed). This suggests that the `HEAD` branch intends to **preserve this structure**, even if doing so may lead to unexpected behavior in scenarios where the `if` condition does not evaluate to true.

**Other Branch Changes:**
- The other branch instead closes the function immediately after the `if` block, implying that the `return 1;` statement is no longer required and perhaps functionality has been moved or rearranged elsewhere. However, given that no additional return or control logic appears in the provided snippet, **its removal at this point could lead to undefined behavior** (particularly if the function is expected to return a value based on execution context).

---

### Conflict Evaluation

Both sides implement different outcomes:

- **`HEAD` version** preserves full function signature compatibility if the function expects an `int` return value.
- **`4348393..` version** closes the function immediately but **lacks a return**, which could indicate removal of this section or potentially an error if part of a more extensive logic restructuringâ€”**which we cannot see**.

Given ambiguity about full function behavior, return type, or changes from the remote branch (and no additional logic following the if), neither resolution can be definitively validated without the full function definition.

---

### Resolution Decision

Since ambiguity exists regarding intended semantics and return-handling logic, and the instruction explicitly requests the conflict to remain unmodified in the event of uncertainty, the correct response is to **return the snippet as-is with the merge conflict markers intact**.

### Final Output

```c
  if (sshfwd_write(xconn->c, data, len) > 0) {
    xconn->throttled = 1;
    xconn->no_data_sent_to_x_client = FALSE;
    sk_set_frozen(xconn->s, 1);
  }
