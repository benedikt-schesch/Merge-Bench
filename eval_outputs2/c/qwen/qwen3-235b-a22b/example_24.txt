The merge conflict exists in a line containing a version control system generated identifier block. This line is typically auto-updated by the version control system whenever a commit occurs and does not directly affect the runtime behavior of the program.

Since both versions appear identical in structure and only differ by the revision number and timestamp, and no clear functional intent or difference impacting program behavior is evident from either version, the resolution intent is ambiguous.

As per your instruction, since there is no clear intent or unique semantic priority present that would dictate choosing one version over the other, the appropriate action is to preserve the conflicting code exactly as provided.
