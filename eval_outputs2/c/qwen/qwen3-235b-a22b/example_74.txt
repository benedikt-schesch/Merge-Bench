The provided scenario presents a merge conflict between `InitCommonControls();` (used in **HEAD**) and `init_common_controls();` (introduced in the other branch, `fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5`). Both are likely attempts to initialize Windows common controls, but from different development paths:

- `InitCommonControls()` is a standard Windows API function, commonly used in Windows GUI applications to ensure common controls (like edit boxes, buttons, etc.) are available.
- `init_common_controls()` appears to be a re-named or wrapper function, possibly for consistency, encapsulation, or internal abstraction reasons, but its semantics and side-effects are not explicitly known from this snippet alone.

---

From a **semantic merge conflict resolution** perspective, both sides aim to fulfill the same goal: initializing necessary GUI components for the application. However, the actual internal implementation, correctness, and project-wide implications of `init_common_controls()` are not known within this isolated snippet. Therefore:

- If `init_common_controls()` simply wraps `InitCommonControls()`, then it should be fine to use.
- If `init_common_controls()` performs a custom or alternative initialization, and the HEAD intent is to stick with the Windows standard call, then `InitCommonControls()` is correct.

Since the **full intent, history, or usage** is not clear from the context given (e.g., no definition or use elsewhere), and the semantic equivalence or substitution isn't verifiable from this snippet alone, the conflict cannot be safely resolved without further knowledge.

Therefore, per the instruction:

> If you are not sure on how to resolve the conflict or if the intent is ambiguous, please return the same snippet with the conflict.

Here is the **unchanged** code with the conflict preserved:

```c
  hwnd = NULL;
  flags = FLAG_VERBOSE | FLAG_INTERACTIVE;

  sk_init();
