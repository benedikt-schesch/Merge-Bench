The merge conflict here involves a difference in the copyright year range, specifically whether the end year is `2014` or `2015`. Both changes appear semantically valid and likely reflect different timelines or branches in the contribution history. Since copyright strings are often reflective of legal or historical context — and without additional evidence to suggest which is definitively correct — this is ambiguous from a semantic and intent-based perspective.

The code block should not be altered due to lack of clarity on which copyright range accurately represents the current licensing authority, and any modification could have implications in terms of licensing clarity or distribution rights.

### Conflict preserved
Therefore, in line with the user’s instruction to preserve the conflict when the intent is ambiguous, the code snippet will be returned **unchanged**, including the merge conflict markers and original spacing.
