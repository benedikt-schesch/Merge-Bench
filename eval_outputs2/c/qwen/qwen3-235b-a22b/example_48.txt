The merge conflict arises due to conflicting `$Id` version control tags. Both lines serve the same purpose of indicating the file's revision, but they stem from different branches with different revision numbers. Since the `$Id` tag is typically automatically managed by the version control system and its format can be ambiguous without knowing which branch should dominate, the semantic intent on both sides is unclear: one line reflects a mainline revision (1.17), while the other reflects a stable release branch (1.10.4.90). 

Since the resolution cannot be determined unambiguously by the semantics or intent alone, the conflict remains unresolved.
