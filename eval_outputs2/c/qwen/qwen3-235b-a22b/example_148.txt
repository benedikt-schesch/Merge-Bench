The merge conflict lies in the declaration of the `new_backlog` variable. On the `HEAD` side, the code declares `int len, new_backlog;`, which implies that the writer intended to work with this variable later in the function. On the other side (`4348393f562c...`), the declaration is reduced to only `int len;`, suggesting this variable is no longer needed or used.

However, without knowing how `new_backlog` might be used in the remainder of the `handle_socket_unfreeze()` function, the intent and semantics of both sides remain ambiguous:

- If `new_backlog` is used in logic further down the function, removing it would break the logic from the `HEAD` branch.
- Conversely, if the `4348393f562c...` branch intentionally removed any usage of `new_backlog`, keeping it would be unnecessary or even incorrect.

Thus, given the incomplete picture of how the function actually uses these variables, the safe and semantically neutral approach is to acknowledge this ambiguity and preserve the conflict marker as Git originally flagged it.

Here is the returned snippet with the merge conflict preserved:

```c

static void handle_socket_unfreeze(void *psv)
{
  Handle_Socket ps = (Handle_Socket)psv;
  void *data;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  int len, new_backlog;
=======
  int len;
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
