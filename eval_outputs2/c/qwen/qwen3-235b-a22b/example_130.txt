The provided code snippet presents a merge conflict where the two branches differ in both the return behavior of the function `plug_closing` and the control flow following that call, as well as the handling of the `s->connected` flag. Specifically:

- **HEAD** version:
  ```c
  return plug_closing(...);
  return 0;
  ```
- **Other** version:
  ```c
  plug_closing(...);
  return;
  ```

---

The **intent semantics** between both branches diverge subtly:

- `HEAD` explicitly terminates the execution of the function in the case of an error by returning a value: the result of `plug_closing(...)` and optionally `0` if the connection attempt is still in progress.

- The **other** branch allows execution to proceed after `plug_closing(...)`, though in that case, the function ends up returning `void` when the connection attempt is not yet complete. This is semantically ambiguous and potentially invalid, because it would not match the function's actual return type if it is expected to return a value (e.g., `int`).

Without further context about the function signature (e.g., the return type of this function), we cannot definitively determine which version is semantically and syntactically correct.

---

Because the **intent and return type of the function is ambiguous**, and resolving the conflict could result in invalid or misleading code depending on the actual usage context, the appropriate action is to leave the merge conflict unresolved as per the instructions.

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved exactly as given:

```c

          while (err && s->addr && sk_nextaddr(s->addr, &s->step)) {
            err = try_connect(s);
          }
          if (err)
<<<<<<< HEAD
            return plug_closing(s->plug, strerror(err), err, 0);
          if (!s->connected)
            return 0; /* another async attempt in progress */
=======
            plug_closing(s->plug, strerror(err), err, 0);
          if (!s->connected)
            return; /* another async attempt in progress */
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
        }
      }

      /*
       * If we get here, we've managed to make a connection.
