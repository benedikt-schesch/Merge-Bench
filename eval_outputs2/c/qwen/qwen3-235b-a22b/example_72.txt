The code snippet shows a merge conflict between two function calls. Both `DrawInsert` and `p_DrawInsert` serve the same semantic purpose of drawing an insert at a given position during a drag operation. However, no additional context is provided about why the function was renamed, whether the prefix `p_` indicates an intentional organizational or architectural change, or whether the change should be adopted based on upstream updates.

Since both sides of the merge conflict appear semantically equivalent in intent and no definitive information is given to determine which branch represents the correct evolution of the codebase, this is a case of ambiguous intent.

Accordingly, and per the instruction, the correct response is to return the code snippet **unresolved**, preserving the original conflict:

```c
      case DL_DRAGGING:
        hdl->dragging = 1;
        dest = pl_itemfrompt(dlm->hWnd, dlm->ptCursor, TRUE);
        if (dest > hdl->dummyitem)
          dest = hdl->dummyitem;
<<<<<<< HEAD
        DrawInsert(hwnd, dlm->hWnd, dest);
=======
        p_DrawInsert(hwnd, dlm->hWnd, dest);
>>>>>>> fc089d5df72a9c0eba5b6f11dffc4f9bafae18b5
        if (dest >= 0)
          SetWindowLongPtr(hwnd, DWLP_MSGRESULT, DL_MOVECURSOR);
        else
          SetWindowLongPtr(hwnd, DWLP_MSGRESULT, DL_STOPCURSOR);
        ret |= 1;
```
