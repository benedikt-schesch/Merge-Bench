The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict related to the use of format specifiers in an `sscanf` call used to parse timestamps (`mtime` and `atime`) from a buffer. The conflict lies between two format strings:

- **HEAD** uses `%ld`, which is appropriate for parsing `long` (signed integer) values.
- **The other branch** uses `%lu`, which is intended to parse `unsigned long` values.

---

### Semantics and Intent

The merge conflict centers on two goals:
1. **Reading two numeric fields** from `act->buf` into `act->mtime` and `act->atime`.
2. **Matching the data types** of those variables with the correct format specifiers.

If `mtime` and `atime` are of type `long`, then `%ld` is correct. If they are instead `unsigned long`, then `%lu` would be appropriate. The two branches appear to be engaged in type divergence, but without visibility into the declaration of those fields (`mtime`, `atime`), or knowledge of how the buffer's contents are supposed to be interpreted (e.g., sign vs. unsigned time values), **it's not possible to resolve the conflict conclusively based on intent or semantics**.

---

### Final Decision

Since we cannot determine whether `%ld` or `%lu` is semantically correct based on both branches' intent without further context (i.e., the types of `mtime` and `atime`), the conflict is **ambiguous** and should be preserved for further resolution manually or with deeper contextual insight.

Here is the exact snippet with the unmodified conflict preserved and formatted in Markdown:

```c
      case 'E':
        back->send(backhandle, "", 1);
        act->action = SCP_SINK_ENDDIR;
        return 0;
      case 'T':
<<<<<<< HEAD

          act->settime = 1;
          back->send(backhandle, "", 1);
          continue; /* go round again */
        }
