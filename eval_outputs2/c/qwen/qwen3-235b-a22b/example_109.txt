The merge conflict resides within a function that ends with a closing brace (`}`). The conflicting line is `return 1;`, which is present in the `HEAD` version (likely indicating a desired return code) and missing from the version associated with the commit `4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5`. Importantly, the semantics that would resolve this conflict are not determinable solely from the provided snippet: the function's return type is not visible, and the purpose and logic of the function itself are unclear.

Without knowing the function's return signature — whether it is `void`, `int`, or another type — it is unclear whether `return 1;` is semantically valid or erroneous. Additionally, without further context such as the function's name, purpose, and surrounding declarations, it is impossible to determine the correct resolution from an intent-based standpoint. Both branches might reflect valid intentions that conflict here: adding a definitive return value versus removing it (potentially due to a change in function logic or to avoid undefined behavior).

As per your instructions, if the intent or correct resolution is ambiguous, the appropriate step is to preserve the snippet exactly as-is, without modification.

Here is the code with the merge conflict retained:

```c
      rlogin->firstbyte = 0;
    }
    if (len > 0)
      c_write(rlogin, data, len);
  }
<<<<<<< HEAD
  return 1;

}

static void rlogin_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  Rlogin rlogin = (Rlogin)plug;
