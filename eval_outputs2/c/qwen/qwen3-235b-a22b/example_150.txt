The merge conflict occurs on the second argument of the `handle_unthrottle` function. To resolve this, we must examine the **intent** and **semantics** of both changes.

---

### Semantic Interpretation

- **Contextually**, this section of the code is responsible for **unfreezing** and **unthrottling** a component after some freeze operation. Once the system has successfully thawed, it updates the state (`ps->frozen = UNFROZEN`) and then calls `handle_unthrottle`.

- **Function intent**:
  - `handle_unthrottle(ps->recv_h, new_backlog)`: This suggests an **intent to continue processing** from where throttling left off, potentially resuming based on the backlog that built up during the freeze.
  - `handle_unthrottle(ps->recv_h, 0)`: This implies a **clean reset** of the throttling mechanism, as if no backlog is to be considered post-thaw.

These two changes are clearly at odds semantically: one assumes that the system is continuing processing with awareness of the backlog, and the other starts fresh without regard to it.

---

### Intent Ambiguity

- Without additional context about how `handle_unthrottle` behaves or the broader design semantics of the system (e.g., whether the `new_backlog` variable correctly represents pending data at thaw time or if `0` is a default indicating a clean start), the **intent is not clearly distinguishable.**

- Both changes aim to resolve a scenario that logically follows from the thawing process but do so with non-conflicting intent.

---

### Final Resolution

Given the **uncertainty in the semantic intent**, and absent external context (such as the expected behavior of `handle_unthrottle`, the meaning of `new_backlog`, or design constraints), the conflict **should not be resolved automatically**, as doing so could violate the original intent of one of the changes.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```c
  } else {
    /*
     * Otherwise, we've successfully thawed!
     */
    ps->frozen = UNFROZEN;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    handle_unthrottle(ps->recv_h, new_backlog);
=======
    handle_unthrottle(ps->recv_h, 0);
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
  }
}
