The conflict lies in the variable declarations at the beginning of the `select_result` function. The `HEAD` version declares both `ret` and `open`, while the other branch appears to remove `open`. The rest of the declarations (`err`, `buf`, `s`, `atmark`) are shared and thus not part of the conflict.

### Semantic Reasoning:
- Keeping `open` indicates a need to use it within the function for its intended logic.
- Removing `open` implies it is either no longer necessary or may have been made redundant due to other changes in that branch.

Given no further context in the provided snippet showing usage or interaction of `open`, the **intent behind either change remains ambiguous**.

As per instructions, when the intent is ambiguous, the conflict should **remain unresolved** to avoid introducing issues based on assumptions.

```c
    try_send(s);

void select_result(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)

  DWORD err;
  char buf[20480]; /* nice big buffer for plenty of speed */
