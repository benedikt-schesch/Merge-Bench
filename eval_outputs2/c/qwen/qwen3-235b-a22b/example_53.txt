The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict between two branches attempting to set different loop termination conditions using `UINT_MAX` and `USHRT_MAX`.

### Analysis of Intents

- The `for` loop iteratively attempts to `mmap` a memory page starting from the end of the text segment plus its length, incrementing `addr` and `count` by `memprof_config.pagesize` per iteration.
- Both versions of the conflict appear to intend preventing an infinite loop by bounding the number of iterations. However:
    - `UINT_MAX` implies an intent for **maximally safe** iteration over 32-bit unsigned integers (if supported).
    - `USHRT_MAX` implies a potentially **performance-focused or limit-imposed** approach, perhaps intended to prevent excessive memory mapping attempts.

However, the **type of `count` is not provided**, which is essential in determining which constant would overflow or be invalid. If `count` is of type `unsigned short`, the `UINT_MAX` loop might be ill-formed. Conversely, if `count` is of a larger type like `unsigned int`, then the `USHRT_MAX` loop may be unnecessarily restrictive and defeat the purpose of safely searching for a valid mmap region.

### Resolution Policy

According to the user's instructions, in the event that the intent is **ambiguous or unclear**, we should **not resolve the conflict**, and instead **return the code unchanged with conflict markers included**.

Given that the intent behind changing from `UINT_MAX` to `USHRT_MAX` is **not clearly semantically superior or necessary without knowing the type of `count`**, the semantic intent remains ambiguous.

  if (libruby) {
    /* There is a libruby. Start at the end of the text segment and search for
     * a page.

    addr = info->text_segment + info->text_segment_len;

      ret = mmap(addr, memprof_config.pagesize, PROT_WRITE|PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_ANON|MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
      if (ret != MAP_FAILED) {
        memset(ret, 0x90, memprof_config.pagesize);
        return ret;
      }
