The key to resolving this merge conflict semantically lies in understanding the intended meaning and structure of the code and respecting the contributions from both branches.

---

### **Context and Intent**

The function above ends with:

```c
gtk_initialised = ret;
return ret;
}
```

This suggests the function is returning a status (`ret`) indicating whether GTK initialization was successful and storing it in a global or static variable (`gtk_initialised`).

Then we have a merge conflict:

- **HEAD branch**: shows nothing between the closing `}` and the start of the next function `gtk_askpass_main(...)`, implying no changes here in this branch.
- **Other branch**: adds a new line: `const int buildinfo_gtk_relevant = TRUE;`

This line introduces a global constant indicating that some build information is GTK-related, suggesting it serves as a metadata flag or diagnostic value meant to be visible throughout the translation unit (file).

---

### **Resolution Strategy**

Considering the semantics:

- The added constant `buildinfo_gtk_relevant` is global and likely meant to be defined at file scope.
- There’s no visible logical or syntactic conflict, as one side contributes nothing and the other adds a new variable definition.
- Inserting `buildinfo_gtk_relevant` between the closing of the previous function and the start of the next one is a natural and logically cohesive placement.

Therefore, the correct resolution is to **accept the line from the other branch** and place it directly after the `}` from the previous function but before the signature of `gtk_askpass_main`.

### ✅ Resolved Snippet

```c
  gtk_initialised = ret;
  return ret;
}

const int buildinfo_gtk_relevant = TRUE;

char *gtk_askpass_main(const char *display,
                       const char *wintitle,
                       const char *prompt,
                       int *success)
{
```
