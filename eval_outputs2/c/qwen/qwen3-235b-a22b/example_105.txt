The merge conflict occurs in a `printf` statement following a failed `canonify()` call, where two different versions of the code attempt to print the input string involved in the failure.

---

### Analysis of Intent:

- **HEAD version** attempts to print `dir`, but since `dir` has just been determined as `NULL` (`if (!dir)`), attempting to dereference it (via `%s`) leads to **undefined behavior**, likely a **crash** in practice.
  
- The **other branch version**, instead, prints `cmd->words[i]`, which is **safe and semantically correct** â€” it displays the original input that failed to be canonified.

---

### Semantic Resolution:

Since the goal is to print the invalid input string for debugging purposes, and `dir` is known to be `NULL` at that point, the correct value to use is `cmd->words[i]`. Therefore, the `printf` line from the other branch should be used.

All other surrounding code appears to have consistent logic from both sides of the merge, and no changes are needed there.

### Resolved Snippet (Conflict Removed and Correct Line Chosen):

```c

  ret = 1;
  for (i = 1; i < cmd->nwords; i++) {
    dir = canonify(cmd->words[i]);
    if (!dir) {
      printf("%s: canonify: %s\n", cmd->words[i], fxp_error());
      return 0;
    }

    req = fxp_mkdir_send(dir);
    pktin = sftp_wait_for_reply(req);

```
