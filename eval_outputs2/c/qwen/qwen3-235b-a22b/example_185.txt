The code snippet you've provided includes a merge conflict located between two statements affecting control flow: one branch returns `0`, while the other includes a `break;`. This context suggests that this code resides within a `switch` statement and that both changes are intended to affect the flow differentlyâ€”either returning early or allowing subsequent logic to run after the `switch`.

---

The `return 0;` in the `HEAD` change implies that the code is intended to exit the function immediately upon fulfilling some condition, whereas the `break;` introduced in the other commit suggests a desire to exit only the `case` and continue processing the rest of the function (which, as seen, returns `1` by default at the end).

---

Without clear additional context to understand the implications of one change over the other, especially regarding whether an early return is semantically correct or if further logic must execute, it would be unsafe to favor one branch over the other. 

Thus, under the condition that `if unsure on how to resolve or if the intent is ambiguous, return the same snippet with the conflict`, the appropriate choice is to preserve the merge conflict exactly as-is, without alteration.

	return 1;
