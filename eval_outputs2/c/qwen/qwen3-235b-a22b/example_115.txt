The code snippet presents a merge conflict between two different usages of coroutine termination macros:

```c
    share_got_pkt_from_downstream(
        cs, cs->recvbuf[4], cs->recvbuf + 5, cs->recvlen - 5);
  }

dead:;
<<<<<<< HEAD
  crFinish(1);
=======
  crFinishV;
>>>>>>> 4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5
}

static void share_sent(Plug plug, int bufsize)
{
  /* struct ssh_sharing_connstate *cs = (struct ssh_sharing_connstate *)plug; */
```

---

### Analysis

The conflict lies between:

- **`crFinish(1);`** – This suggests the developer intends to signal a completion with a status code `1`, which could, by convention, indicate failure or some custom signal.
- **`crFinishV;`** – This seems to be a "void" version of the macro, possibly indicating normal or clean completion without an explicit value.

The code around the conflict includes:
- A call to `share_got_pkt_from_downstream` immediately before the `dead:` label, which implies this path may be a point of controlled or conditional termination.
- `dead:` appears to be a named exit point — commonly used in C integration with coroutine mechanics — which proceeds to call the macro in conflict.

---

### Resolution Decision

While `crFinish(1);` implies a deliberate value-based state transition (possibly error handling or signaling), `crFinishV` may indicate correctness within the coroutine's lifecycle design. However:

- The exact meaning of `crFinish` and `crFinishV` depends on the library or internal codebase macros.
- The presence of a coroutine label `dead:` suggests that this is not a simple clean exit, but possibly a controlled or conditional termination path — possibly due to an error or off-path event.
- However, **without explicit documentation or context regarding how these macros are defined or intended to be used in this project**, the semantic difference is ambiguous.
- Additionally, the absence of further commits or comments makes it unclear whether the intent of the original author or the merging branch takes precedence.

---

### Final Output

As the intent between `crFinish(1);` and `crFinishV;` cannot be confidently resolved without external context, we follow the instruction rule: **when uncertain, return the snippet including the unresolved conflict.**

    share_got_pkt_from_downstream(
