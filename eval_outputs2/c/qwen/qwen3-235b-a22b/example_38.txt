The provided code snippet presents a conflict between two potential intentions for when to send a deletion report for an edge. One branch includes a condition `!tunnelserver`, while the other does not.

---

**Analysis:**

1. **Context Semantics**:  
   - The code checks if a condition (`report`) is true, and in one branch also checks if `tunnelserver` is false before calling the `send_del_edge` function.
   - The actual edge deletion (`edge_del`) is unconditional, suggesting that the `if`-block is specifically guarding communication or side effects, not the core logic.
   - The comment about MST and SSSP further implies that this edge deletion and reporting is part of a larger network or graph traversal mechanism.

2. **Intent Interpretation**:  
   - The branch with `!tunnelserver` seems to suggest that in a `tunnelserver` mode, edge deletion messages should not be sentâ€”potentially to prevent broadcasting in a specific operational mode.
   - The branch without the condition suggests that `tunnelserver` is either not relevant to this logic, or that `report` alone is sufficient to determine whether to send the message.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   - Since the exact meaning and usage of `tunnelserver` are not elaborated, and without project-wide conventions or documentation, the decision to include or exclude that condition remains **ambiguous**.
   - The critical difference lies in whether `tunnelserver` should impact message sending at this point in logic. There's no clear evidence to assume one approach over the other.

**Recommended Response:**

Given the ambiguity and lack of definitive intent, the best course of action is to **not resolve the conflict automatically** but leave the snippet as-is with the conflict markers still visible.

```c

	if(c->socket)
		closesocket(c->socket);

	if(c->edge) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		if(report)
=======
		if(report && !tunnelserver)
>>>>>>> af86a3226ea42375644b3f99c182c778d327de1e
			send_del_edge(broadcast, c->edge);

		edge_del(c->edge);

		/* Run MST and SSSP algorithms */
