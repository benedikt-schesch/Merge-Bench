The provided code is structured such that if an error occurs (as indicated by a non-NULL `error_msg`), the function logs the error, closes and clears the listening socket, and should then return to indicate the error.

The conflict occurs on the line `return 1;`. On one side (`HEAD`), it explicitly returns 1, signaling failure or a particular error state. On the other side—represented by the merge commit `4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5`—nothing is present at this line, implying either a change in control flow or a possible bug if the full function returns a type other than `void`.

### Semantic Intent Analysis

From a semantic point of view:

- The presence of `error_msg` triggers error handling logic: logging, resource cleanup, and termination of the function execution.
- The function returns an int, given that `return 1;` is valid and executed, and the function is not marked `void`.
- Removing the `return 1;` would allow execution to proceed past the `if` statement, which is semantically inconsistent with how error handling is functioning.
- If the other branch intended to remove `return 1;`, there is no replacement logic provided (outside the snippet), so its intent is ambiguous and this would risk falling off the function without an explicit return, which is undefined behavior in C.

### Resolution

Given the above reasoning, and considering that returning `1` is explicitly aligned with error propagation and control logic in the presence of an error condition, it's semantically and structurally appropriate to keep the line.
