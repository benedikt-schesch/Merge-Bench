The merge conflict resides in the copyright year within a `zend_extension` structure. Although it is intuitive to consider that `2015` might indicate the last active contribution year based on its newer value, we must treat both sides of the merge as valid contributions with potentially legitimate reasons for using their respective years.

---

**Semantics and Intent:**

- **Year "2014"** (from the branch): Could indicate that the branch represents a point in time where the copyright was authoritative or intentionally reverted for accuracy.
- **Year "2015"** (from `HEAD`): Might reflect an update that included contributions up to 2015.

In the context of software maintenance, a copyright line often reflects the years when the project was actively worked on. However, without detailed knowledge of the project's guidelines or historical context, determining which year is semantically more accurate is ambiguous.

---

**Conflict Resolution Decision:**

Given the lack of additional context to determine the correct or more appropriate year, and following the principle that we should **not** speculate or alter the code when ambiguity exists, the conflict should **not** be resolved automatically.

Therefore, the merge conflict remains unresolved as the intent from both branches cannot be definitively interpreted in favor of one or the other.
