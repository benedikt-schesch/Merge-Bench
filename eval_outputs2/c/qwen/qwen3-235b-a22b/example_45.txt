The snippet involves a merge conflict centered on a line that differs in the use of a type cast during a `xmalloc` call. The two diverging lines are:

- `new = (past_request_t *) xmalloc(sizeof(*new));`
- `new = xmalloc(sizeof(*new));`

The meaning and intent of both lines are semantically identical: **allocate a block of memory sufficient to hold a `past_request_t` and assign it to `new`**. The difference lies solely in the explicit casting of the return value of `xmalloc`.

### Semantic Intent Analysis:

In C:
- `xmalloc` (like `malloc`) returns a `void*`, which can be implicitly converted (without a cast) to any other object pointer type.
- Casting `void*` in C is not required and is at times discouraged; it adds verbosity and can introduce subtle bugs if the pointer type changes accidentally (e.g., through a reconnect).

Given that:
- The variable `new` is of type `past_request_t *`, 
- `xmalloc` provides sufficient memory,
- The code compiles correctly under standard C rules,

The **cast is unnecessary** and may even be viewed as **non-idiomatic** or **style drift** unless explicitly required by a particular project convention.

---

### Conclusion:

Since both versions express the same semantic intent and the absence of the cast is more idiomatic and preferred in standard C, the correct resolution is to **remove the cast**.

Here is the resolved code snippet, preserving all surrounding context and spacing exactly as given:

```c

	if(avl_search(past_request_tree, &p)) {
		ifdebug(SCARY_THINGS) logger(LOG_DEBUG, _("Already seen request"));
		return true;
	} else {
		new = xmalloc(sizeof(*new));
		new->request = xstrdup(request);
		new->firstseen = now;
		avl_insert(past_request_tree, new);
		return false;
	}
