The merge conflict lies in the `#define AF_UNKNOWN` value. Here's the complete provided code snippet, **preserved exactly as it is**, including spacing and context:

```c
	uint16_t x[8];
} ipv6_t;

typedef short length_t;

<<<<<<< HEAD
#define AF_UNKNOWN 0xFFFF
=======
#define AF_UNKNOWN 255
>>>>>>> af86a3226ea42375644b3f99c182c778d327de1e

struct sockaddr_unknown {
	uint16_t family;
	uint16_t pad1;
	uint32_t pad2;
```

## ⚠️ Conflict Resolution Note

In the absence of sufficient context or usage information within the full codebase, it's **not safe to assume** which value (`0xFFFF` or `255`) is semantically intended.

- `0xFFFF (65535)` fits in a `uint16_t`, suggesting an intention to use the full 16-bit unsigned space, which is aligned with the structure definition (`uint16_t family;`).
- `255 (0xFF)` is also within range of `uint16_t`, but it may be chosen to be compatible with an 8-bit legacy context.

**Because the conflict introduces ambiguity about the design intention or usage in other parts of the codebase**, it's best to **preserve the conflict** and let the developer manually resolve it after considering wider implications.
