The code snippet contains a merge conflict in the `ngx_commands_t` array, specifically between the `HEAD` (which adds a new configuration command `cache_purge_response_type`) and the `e2ef03b2` branch (which does not provide any changes in the conflict section).

Determining the correct resolution requires understanding **both** branches' intentions. However, the absence of meaningful content in the `e2ef03b2` section introduces ambiguity. It is unclear whether:

- The `e2ef03b2` branch intended to remove or modify the `cache_purge_response_type` command,
- Or it simply had no changes, and the marking was incorrectly inserted.

Since the actual changes from the `e2ef03b2` side are not visible or specified, and the semantic intent on both sides cannot be fully verified, the safest and correct resolution, per the instructions, is to return the snippet **with the conflict markers intact** and **preserve the original structure and context**, so the developer can apply their contextual knowledge.
