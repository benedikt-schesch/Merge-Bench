The given code contains a merge conflict between two versions of a line that assigns the result of `pty_real_select_result(pty, -1, status)` to a variable `ret`. While one version (`HEAD`) maintains a cumulative result in `ret` using a logical AND (`ret = ret && ...`), the other version (`4348393f562c8011ebca43d6198e98638aa115b5`) simply calls the function without capturing the result. 

This discrepancy could indicate that the intent of the two branches differs. Specifically:

- The `HEAD` version likely intends to use the result of `pty_real_select_result` as part of a larger logical evaluation that accumulates across loop iterations via the `ret` variable.
- The other branch may intend to disregard this check entirely, treating `pty_real_select_result` as performing side effects only or assumes correctness is enforced elsewhere.

Since the snippet provided does not show the full context surrounding the usage or declaration of `ret`, nor its effect beyond this loop, the *intent and semantics* of the two changes are ambiguous. One branch maintains stateful logic about execution success; the other may be simplifying or changing behavior.

### Semantic Ambiguity and Conflict Resolution Decision

In this scenario, the most responsible and semantically accurate choice is to **preserve the merge conflict markers** and **not resolve the conflict**, because:

- We cannot determine with certainty whether `ret` is still used downstream in the code (in the combined merged branches).
- The logical behavior of the program can meaningfully change depending on whether `ret` accumulates the return value or not.
- Finalizing a resolution without understanding the broader implications could introduce logic errors or even subtle bugs.

      pty = find234(ptys_by_pid, &pid, pty_find_by_pid);

      if (pty)
