The code snippet includes a merge conflict in a conditional statement that determines whether `stdin` should be monitored for reading. Both sides of the merge attempt to establish whether the system should begin reading from `stdin` based on the readiness of a connection and a backend to receive data. The key divergence lies in the inclusion or exclusion of a condition `connopen`, which appears to affect the logic for allowing a read operation to proceed.

This condition—`connopen`—may refer to whether or not a connection has been fully established from the local state, while the condition `back->connected(backhandle)` may represent the internal backend's view of connectedness. Without further information about how these conditions are maintained and updated in the application, we cannot determine the correctness or necessity of including `connopen` in this logic.

The semantic intent of both sides appears aligned in wanting to ensure the system is in a stable, ready state (`!sending && back->connected(backhandle) && back->sendok(backhandle) && back->sendbuffer(...) < ...`) before proceeding to read from `stdin`. However, the presence or removal of `connopen` changes the requirements for what qualifies as "ready"—possibly introducing correctness or safety considerations in edge cases.

Given that:
- The intent and correctness of removing `connopen` are not clear,
- No evidence is provided that `back->connected(...)` fully supersedes `connopen`,
- And both parties express different logical preconditions,

The resolution must reflect semantic ambiguity and defer resolution to human inspection.

Accordingly, below is the full unchanged code snippet, including conflict markers:

```c
    FD_ZERO(&xset);
    maxfd = 0;

    FD_SET_MAX(signalpipe[0], maxfd, rset);

<<<<<<< HEAD

        back->sendbuffer(backhandle) < MAX_STDIN_BACKLOG) {
      /* If we're OK to send, then try to read from stdin. */
      FD_SET_MAX(STDIN_FILENO, maxfd, rset);
    }
```
