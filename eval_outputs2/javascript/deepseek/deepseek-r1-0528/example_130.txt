Based on the semantic analysis, I've resolved the conflict by preserving the more comprehensive condition from the other branch while keeping the audio initialization logic. The solution checks both metadata existence and codec presence, while maintaining the audio status update logic.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```javascript


        let meta = this._audioMetadata;
        let track = this._audioTrack;

        if (!meta || !meta.codec) {
            if (this._hasAudio === false) {
                this._hasAudio = true;
                this._mediaInfo.hasAudio = true;
            }

            // initial metadata
            meta = this._audioMetadata = {};
            meta.type = 'audio';
            meta.id = track.id;
            meta.timescale = this._timescale;
```
