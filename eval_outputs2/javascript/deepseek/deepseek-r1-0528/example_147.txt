The conflict arises from different approaches to handling focus and key events. The other branch introduces `ensureFocus` for focus management and adds an `onKeyEvent` callback check, while both branches handle IE escape key quirks but with different variables (`old_ie` vs `ie_upto10`). 

The resolution:
1. Uses `ensureFocus` from the other branch for focus handling
2. Combines the DOM event checks including the `onKeyEvent` callback
3. Preserves both IE escape key fixes (`old_ie` and `ie_upto10`)
4. Keeps the duplicate `var code` assignment since it's harmless in JavaScript

Here's the resolved snippet:

```javascript
  }

  var lastStoppedKey = null;
  function onKeyDown(e) {
    var cm = this;
    ensureFocus(cm);
    if (signalDOMEvent(cm, e) || cm.options.onKeyEvent && cm.options.onKeyEvent(cm, addStop(e))) return;
    if (old_ie && e.keyCode == 27) e.returnValue = false;
    var code = e.keyCode;
    // IE does strange things with escape.
    if (ie_upto10 && e.keyCode == 27) e.returnValue = false;
    var code = e.keyCode;
    cm.display.shift = code == 16 || e.shiftKey;
    var handled = handleKeyBinding(cm, e);
```
