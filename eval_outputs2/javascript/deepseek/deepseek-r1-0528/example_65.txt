The conflict is about a single blank line between the event listener and the comment. Both branches are functionally identical - one has an extra blank line (HEAD) while the other doesn't (a9ce98f). Since blank lines are stylistic and don't affect functionality, I've preserved the blank line for better readability between code sections.

Resolved code:
```javascript
        if (e.key === 'Backspace' && !(e.target instanceof HTMLInputElement)) {
            back();
        }
    });


    /**
     * Set UI from settings and attach listeners
     */

    for (const [k, v] of Object.entries(settings)) {
```
