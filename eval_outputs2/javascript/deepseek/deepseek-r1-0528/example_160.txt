The conflict arises from two different approaches to configuring storage devices for the FreeBSD boot entry. The HEAD branch uses a `cdrom` device with a ReactOS ISO, while the other branch uses an `hda` device with a FreeBSD disk image. 

Given the context that:
1. The object has `id: "freebsd-boot"` and `name: "FreeBSD"`
2. Using a ReactOS ISO for a FreeBSD boot entry is semantically inconsistent
3. The other branch provides a FreeBSD disk image which aligns with the entry's purpose

The resolution keeps the semantically consistent `hda` configuration from the other branch. The resolved snippet maintains all context and spacing:

```javascript
                name: "FreeBSD",
            },
            {
                id: "freebsd-boot",
                memory_size: 256 * 1024 * 1024,
                hda: {
                    "url": HOST + "freebsd.img",
                    "size": 2147483648,
                    "async": true,
                    use_parts: !ON_LOCALHOST,
                },
                name: "FreeBSD",
            },
```
