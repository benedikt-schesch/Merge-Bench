Here's the resolved snippet preserving context and semantics while incorporating both intents:

```javascript
        if (!data) {
            last_image_data = null;
            return;
        }

        let delay = parseInt(settings.funcaptcha_solve_delay_time);
        delay = delay ? delay : 1000;
        const delta = settings.funcaptcha_solve_delay ? (delay - (Time.time() - solve_start)) : 0;
        if (delta > 0) {
            await Time.sleep(delta);
        }

        // Solve
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Kept the configurable delay from HEAD (`settings.funcaptcha_solve_delay_time`)
2. Maintained the default 1000ms delay from both versions
3. Preserved the delay calculation logic using `solve_start`
4. Both branches fundamentally agreed on:
   - Using a delay mechanism when `funcaptcha_solve_delay` is enabled
   - The same conditional sleep logic
   - The same 1000ms fallback value

The conflict arose from different implementations of the same semantic goal (configurable delay with fallback), which were cleanly mergeable. The resolved version maintains flexibility from HEAD while keeping the simpler constant value as a fallback.
