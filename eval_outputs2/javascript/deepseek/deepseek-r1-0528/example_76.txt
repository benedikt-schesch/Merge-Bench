The conflict arises from differing approaches to configuring settings for mobile devices and linear filtering support. Both branches set `config.DYE_RESOLUTION = 256` for mobile, but they handle `config.SHADING` differently:

1. **HEAD branch** (current branch) sets both:
   ```javascript
   if (isMobile()) {
       config.DYE_RESOLUTION = 256;
       config.SHADING = false; // Force-disable shading on mobile
   }
   ```

2. **Other branch** sets resolution for mobile separately from shading (which is disabled only when linear filtering is unsupported):
   ```javascript
   if (isMobile())
       { config.DYE_RESOLUTION = 256; }
   if (!ext.supportLinearFiltering)
       { config.SHADING = false; } // Disable shading if no linear filtering
   ```

**Resolution**: Combine both intents:
- Keep mobile resolution setting from both branches
- Preserve HEAD's mobile shading disable
- Keep other branch's linear filtering check

Resolved code:
```javascript

var ref = getWebGLContext(canvas);
var gl = ref.gl;
var ext = ref.ext;

if (isMobile()) {
    config.DYE_RESOLUTION = 256;
    config.SHADING = false;
}
if (!ext.supportLinearFiltering)
    { config.SHADING = false; }
