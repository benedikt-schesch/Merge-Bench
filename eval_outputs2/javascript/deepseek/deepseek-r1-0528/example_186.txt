Since the intent behind `useEnhancedReducer` vs `useControlledState` is ambiguous without deeper context about their implementations and purpose in the codebase, I'm returning the unresolved conflict. Both hooks appear to manage reducer state but likely have semantic differences in behavior that I can't verify.

```javascript

  // Reducer init.
  const [
    {isOpen, highlightedIndex, selectedItem, inputValue},
    dispatch,
<<<<<<< HEAD
  ] = useEnhancedReducer(downshiftSelectReducer, initialState, props)
=======
  ] = useControlledState(downshiftSelectReducer, initialState, props)
>>>>>>> fe0fd13be9c75b6e6834d9f712979339b2d50af8

  // Refs
  const toggleButtonRef = useRef(null)
  const menuRef = useRef(null)
  const isInitialMountRef = useRef(true)

```

Key reasons for not resolving:
1. The hooks suggest different state management strategies (`enhanced` vs `controlled`)
2. Without knowing if these hooks are interchangeable or have different side effects
3. No additional context about component requirements
4. Preserving original spacing and conflict markers as requested

A proper resolution would require:
- Understanding differences between the two hooks
- Knowing if props structure matches both implementations
- Seeing how state is consumed elsewhere
- Determining if parent component expects controlled vs self-managed state
