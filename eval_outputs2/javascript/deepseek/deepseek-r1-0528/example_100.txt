Based on analyzing the intent of both changes, the resolution combines the `defaultFormat` property from HEAD with the new `scalePercentBy100` property from the other branch. The comma placement is adjusted to maintain valid JavaScript syntax.

Resolved code:
```javascript
        locales = {},
        defaults = {
            currentLocale: 'en',
            zeroFormat: null,
            nullFormat: null,
            defaultFormat: '0,0',
            scalePercentBy100: true
        },
        options = {
            currentLocale: defaults.currentLocale,
            zeroFormat: defaults.zeroFormat,
            nullFormat: defaults.nullFormat,

```

Explanation:
1. Preserved HEAD's `defaultFormat: '0,0'` property
2. Added trailing comma to `defaultFormat` to prepare for new property
3. Incorporated other branch's `scalePercentBy100: true` property
4. Maintained all surrounding context unchanged
5. Kept the `options` object structure intact since it's outside the conflict scope

The resolution is semantically valid as both changes are additive and non-conflicting - one sets a default format string while the other adds a new configuration flag.
