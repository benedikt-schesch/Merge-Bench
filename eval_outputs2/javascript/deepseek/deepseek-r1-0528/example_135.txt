The merge conflict cannot be resolved automatically due to ambiguity in the intent behind the changes. The HEAD branch introduces a new `onHiddenSSIDChange` handler, while the other branch completely removes this functionality. Without additional context about whether this feature should be preserved or removed, I'm returning the unresolved conflict:

```javascript
    setSettings({ ...settings, portrait });
  };
  const onHidePasswordChange = (hidePassword) => {
    setSettings({ ...settings, hidePassword });
  };
<<<<<<< HEAD
  const onHiddenSSIDChange = (hiddenSSID) => {
    setSettings({ ...settings, hiddenSSID });
  };
=======
>>>>>>> df6d62c397992aef26c3abb26ad667bcbc7184ad
  const onFirstLoad = () => {
    html.style.direction = htmlDirection();
    firstLoad.current = false;
  };


``` 

Key observations:
1. The HEAD branch adds functionality for `hiddenSSID` configuration
2. The other branch (df6d62c) removes this functionality entirely
3. Both changes are semantically valid but mutually exclusive
4. No overlapping modifications exist in surrounding context
5. The decision requires domain knowledge about whether `hiddenSSID` support should be included

Resolution requires manual intervention to determine if the feature should be:
- Preserved (keep HEAD version)
- Removed (accept other branch's deletion)
- Modified (create new implementation combining intents)
