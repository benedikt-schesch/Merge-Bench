I'll resolve this merge conflict by preserving the new parameter from the other branch while maintaining the type annotation style from the base branch. Here's the resolved snippet:

```javascript
  }
}

export function createEnzymeSerializer({
  classNameReplacer,
  DOMElements = true,
  includeStyles = true
} /*: Options */ = {}) {
  const emotionSerializer = createEmotionSerializer({
    classNameReplacer,
    DOMElements,
    includeStyles
  })

```

Reasoning:
1. Both branches agree on `DOMElements = true`
2. The other branch adds a valuable new parameter `includeStyles = true` which is used in the serializer
3. The base branch's Flow type annotation style (`/*: Options */`) is preserved for consistency
4. The comma after `DOMElements = true` is maintained for the new parameter
5. The function body requires `includeStyles` so it must be included
6. The spacing and context are preserved exactly as in the original snippet
