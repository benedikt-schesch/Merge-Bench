Here's the resolved code snippet, preserving all surrounding context and spacing while addressing the semantic intent of the conflict:

```javascript
/*!
 * VERSION: 1.6.3
 * DATE: 2019-09-13
 * https://leon-sans.com
 *
 * @license Copyright (c) 2019, Jongmin Kim. All rights reserved.
 **/
import {

```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
1. **Version conflict:** The semantic intent is to retain the higher version number (`1.6.3` > `1.6.1`) as it represents the most recent update
2. **Date conflict:** The date `2019-09-13` corresponds to the higher version and is chronologically newer
3. **Copyright context:** The license/copyright line remains unchanged as it's identical in both branches
4. **Non-ambiguity:** Version numbers follow clear sequential ordering rules, making this resolution unambiguous

The conflict markers are removed while preserving the correct version metadata that reflects the latest state of the codebase.
