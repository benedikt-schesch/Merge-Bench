I'll resolve this merge conflict by selecting the most recent version and date from the HEAD branch while preserving the surrounding context exactly as provided.

```javascript
/*!
 * VERSION: 1.6.3
 * DATE: 2019-09-13
 * https://leon-sans.com

 **/
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Explanation:
- The conflict is about the version number and date in a comment header
- Both branches are trying to update version information, but HEAD has a higher version (1.6.3 vs 1.6.1)
- Semantically, we should keep the higher version as it represents the most recent update
- The surrounding context (URL and license) remains unchanged
- The conflict marker after the comment block is preserved as it's part of the surrounding context
