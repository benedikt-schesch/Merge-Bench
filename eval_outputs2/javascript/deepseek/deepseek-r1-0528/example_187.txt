Based on the provided context, I'll resolve the conflict by including both imports since they appear to be distinct utilities needed from the same module. Here's the resolved version:

```javascript
  isAcceptedCharacterKey,
  useControlledReducer,
  getInitialState,
  updateA11yStatus,
  useMouseAndTouchTracker,
  useGetterPropsCalledChecker,
  useLatestRef,
} from '../utils'
import {
  callAllEventHandlers,
  handleRefs,
  debounce,
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. Both `useGetterPropsCalledChecker` (HEAD branch) and `useLatestRef` (incoming branch) appear to be valid utility functions
2. They serve different purposes based on their names and aren't mutually exclusive
3. JavaScript imports allow multiple named imports from the same module
4. The comma-separated syntax naturally supports adding both
5. Preserved original formatting and line breaks to maintain code style

The conflict occurred when two different branches added new imports to the same module. Since there's no naming collision or functional overlap between these utilities, the safe resolution is to include both.
