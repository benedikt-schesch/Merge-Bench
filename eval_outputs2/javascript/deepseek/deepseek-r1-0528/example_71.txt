Based on the semantic analysis of both changes, the conflict arises from two independent features being added at the same location. The HEAD change adds a `is_widget_frame()` function, while the other branch adds a `is_image_frame()` function. Since these appear to be unrelated features checking different conditions, both should be preserved.

Here is the resolved snippet:

```javascript
(async () => {
    function is_widget_frame() {
        const $widget_elem = document.querySelector('button[aria-describedby="descriptionVerify"]') ||
            document.querySelector('#wrong_children_button') ||
            document.querySelector('#wrongTimeout_children_button');
        return $widget_elem !== null;
    }

    function is_image_frame() {
        return get_task() !== null && get_image() !== null;
    }
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Both functions serve different purposes:
   - `is_widget_frame()` checks for UI widget elements
   - `is_image_frame()` checks for image processing context
2. There's no logical overlap or mutual exclusion between the features
3. The blank line between functions is preserved for readability
4. The functions appear sequentially as they would in normal code development

The conflict is resolved by keeping both independent function definitions in the final code.
