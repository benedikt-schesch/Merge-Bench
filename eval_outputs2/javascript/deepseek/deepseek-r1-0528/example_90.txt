Based on the semantic analysis of the merge conflict, I've determined that the manifest file contains auto-generated build artifacts with cryptographic hashes. Since both sides modify the same asset entry (`index.js`) with different hashes, this conflict cannot be safely resolved through merging. The correct solution requires rebuilding the assets after merging the source code changes to generate a new manifest.

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
window.WEBPACK_ASSETS = {"index.js":{"js":"index@8202947f0c05ff5e96d8.js","css":"index@8202947f0c05ff5e96d8.css"},"lib":{"js":"lib@aaed0f9bfcc4ff921c5a.js"},"lib2":{"js":"lib2@819909a89ca45b94d9bf.js"},"lib3":{"js":"lib3@93b22d7460620277a5da.js"},"manifest":{"js":"manifest@f2f4bd774d6c221b3d5f.js"}}

```

Recommended next steps:
1. Keep the conflict markers in version control
2. Merge the actual source code changes from both branches
3. Run the build process to regenerate the manifest
4. Commit the newly generated manifest file
