The merge conflict involves changes to the `renderWeek` function signature and implementation. Both versions modify the function differently:

1. **HEAD version** adds a `firstWeekOfYearMinDays` parameter and passes it to `isoWeek()`
2. **Branch version** simplifies the function by removing the parameter and modifying the variable declaration style

Since the conflict involves incompatible changes to the function's parameters and implementation details, and we don't have additional context about:
- How `isoWeek` is implemented in both branches
- Where this function is called from
- Why the parameter was added/removed

I'm returning the original conflicted snippet as the resolution requires semantic understanding beyond the provided context.

```javascript
            weekNum     = 1 + Math.round((daysBetween - dayShift + prevWeekDay(jan4th.getDay())) / daysPerWeek);

        return weekNum;
    },

<<<<<<< HEAD
    renderWeek = function (d, m, y, firstWeekOfYearMinDays) {
        var date = new Date(y, m, d)
          , week = hasMoment ? moment(date).isoWeek() : isoWeek(date, firstWeekOfYearMinDays)
        ;

    renderWeek = function (d, m, y) {
        var date = new Date(y, m, d),
            week = hasMoment ? moment(date).isoWeek() : isoWeek(date);

        return '<td class="pika-week">' + week + '</td>';
    },

    renderRow = function(days, isRTL, pickWholeWeek, isRowSelected)
