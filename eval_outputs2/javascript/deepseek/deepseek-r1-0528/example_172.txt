```javascript
// @flow
import type {StyleSheetFactoryOptions, Jss, SheetsRegistry, SheetsManager, BaseRule} from 'jss'
import type {Node} from 'react'
import type {Theming} from 'theming'

export type StaticStyles = {[key: string]: {}}

export type Managers = {[key: number]: SheetsManager}

type StyleSheetOptions = {
  ...StyleSheetFactoryOptions,
  classNamePrefix: string
```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
The conflict occurred because one branch added a new `StaticStyles` type definition while the other branch didn't modify this section. Since:
1. The new type doesn't conflict with existing definitions
2. It logically belongs in this type declaration section
3. Both branches' changes are compatible (one adds new content, the other leaves context unchanged)

The resolution adds `StaticStyles` while preserving all other context. The type definition:
```javascript
export type StaticStyles = {[key: string]: {}}
```
is inserted between the import statements and the existing `Managers` type, maintaining consistent formatting and type declaration patterns.
