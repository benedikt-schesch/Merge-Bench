Based on my analysis of both changes, here's the resolved snippet. Both changes appear to be compatible additions to the configuration file:

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack')
const merge = require('webpack-merge')
const base = require('./webpack.base.config')
const HTMLPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')
const vueConfig = require('./vue-loader.config')
const SWPrecachePlugin = require('sw-precache-webpack-plugin')
const VueSSRClientPlugin = require('vue-server-renderer/client-plugin')

const config = merge(base, {
  entry: {
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Both changes add new required modules:
   - `HTMLPlugin` is needed for HTML file generation
   - `vueConfig` provides Vue loader configuration
2. These are complementary additions (no overlap in functionality)
3. Both modules are needed for different aspects of the Webpack configuration
4. Order doesn't matter since they're just declarations
5. No semantic conflict exists between these changes

The resolved version includes both modules while preserving the original context and formatting.
