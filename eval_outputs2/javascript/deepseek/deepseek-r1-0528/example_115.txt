Based on the semantic intent of both changes:

1. The HEAD commit introduces a new array `valid_scrollwheel_magnification`
2. The branch commit changes tool initialization from name-based to ID-based
3. Both changes are compatible since they modify different aspects

The resolution keeps both semantic changes by:
- Preserving the new array from HEAD
- Using the ID-based tool initialization from the branch
- Maintaining all surrounding context unchanged

```javascript

const default_magnification = 1;
const valid_scrollwheel_magnification = [0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
const default_tool = get_tool_by_id(TOOL_PENCIL);

const default_canvas_width = 683;
const default_canvas_height = 384;
let my_canvas_width = default_canvas_width;
let my_canvas_height = default_canvas_height;

```
