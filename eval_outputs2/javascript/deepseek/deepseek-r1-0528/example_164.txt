Based on the semantic context of the version constant, I've resolved the conflict by selecting the higher version number. This follows standard versioning practices where we want to preserve the most recent state version when merging branches.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```javascript
"use strict";

/** @const */
var STATE_VERSION = 6;

/** @const */
var STATE_MAGIC = 0x86768676|0;

/** @const */

```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
- Both branches are trying to define the `STATE_VERSION` constant
- The conflict represents two different version numbers (5 vs 6)
- Version numbers should monotonically increase over time
- Selecting the higher version (6) maintains the most recent state version
- No other modifications were made to preserve surrounding context
- The magic number constant remains unchanged as it wasn't part of the conflict
- The resolution maintains JSDoc annotations and spacing exactly as provided
