The merge conflict arises because both branches are modifying the same import statement from `../control.js`. The HEAD branch imports `HttpError` and `Redirect`, while the other branch imports `Redirect` and `NotFound`. 

After analyzing the semantics:
1. `Redirect` is needed by both branches
2. `HttpError` (likely for general HTTP errors) and `NotFound` (specific 404 error) serve different purposes
3. Both error types are likely required in the combined codebase

The resolution combines all three imports while preserving alphabetical order for consistency.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```javascript
} from '../../utils/url.js';
import { exec } from '../../utils/routing.js';
import { redirect_json_response, render_data } from './data/index.js';
import { add_cookies_to_headers, get_cookies } from './cookie.js';
import { create_fetch } from './fetch.js';
import { HttpError, NotFound, Redirect } from '../control.js';
import {
	validate_layout_exports,
	validate_layout_server_exports,
	validate_page_exports,
	validate_page_server_exports,

```
