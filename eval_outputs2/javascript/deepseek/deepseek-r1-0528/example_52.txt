Based on the provided code snippet and conflict markers, I'll return the exact same content with the conflict preserved since the intent is ambiguous:

```javascript


    while (true) {
        await Time.sleep(1000);

<<<<<<< HEAD
        const settings = await BG.exec('Settings.get');
=======
        const settings = await BG.exec('get_settings');
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        if (!settings || !settings.enabled) {
            continue;
        }

        const hostname = await Location.hostname();

```

**Reason for preserving conflict**: The difference between `'Settings.get'` and `'get_settings'` represents a semantic ambiguity. Without knowing:
1. Which backend API method actually exists
2. Whether this is a refactoring vs. new feature implementation
3. The interface contract of `BG.exec()`
4. Commit context from either branch

I cannot determine which version correctly implements the intended functionality. The conflict markers should be resolved by a developer with full context of both branches' changes.
