The conflict involves adding a `leadingCount` variable in one branch while the other branch doesn't include it. Since we don't have the full context of how `leadingCount` is used later in the function, it's impossible to determine if this change is compatible with the HEAD branch's logic. The intent is ambiguous without seeing the complete implementation.

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
        // formats numbers separators, decimals places, signs, abbreviations
        numberToFormat: function(value, format, roundingFunction) {
            var locale = locales[numeral.options.currentLocale],
                negP = false,
                optDec = false,
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
                leadingCount = 0,
>>>>>>> bdbded520102b8b248087f25727c5837c97a6165
                abbr = '',
                trillion = 1000000000000,
                billion = 1000000000,
                million = 1000000,
                thousand = 1000,

```
