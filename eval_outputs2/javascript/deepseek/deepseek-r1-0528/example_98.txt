Based on the semantic analysis, I've determined that the conflict is ambiguous since both changes modify the same version constant with different values. Without additional context about which version is correct, we must preserve the conflict markers. Here's the exact output with unchanged context:

```javascript
        Variables
    ************************************/

    var numeral,
        _,
<<<<<<< HEAD
        VERSION = '2.0.4',
=======
        VERSION = '2.0.5',
>>>>>>> bdbded520102b8b248087f25727c5837c97a6165
        formats = {},
        locales = {},
        defaults = {
            currentLocale: 'en',
            zeroFormat: null,

```

Key reasons for leaving unresolved:
1. Both changes are atomic modifications to the same variable
2. No additional context exists in the surrounding lines to determine correct version
3. Semantic intent is ambiguous (could be patch vs. minor version update)
4. Version numbers require domain knowledge to resolve correctly

The user should resolve this by:
1. Checking version history in package.json/changelog
2. Consulting commit messages from both branches
3. Determining which version increment is appropriate
4. Manually selecting either 2.0.4 or 2.0.5
