I'll help analyze and resolve this merge conflict. After examining the code, I notice that both changes are related to test setup but serve different purposes. The conflict occurs in the import section where:

1. The HEAD branch imports a moduleId utility from source
2. The other branch imports test reset utilities from tests/utils

Here's the resolved version with both imports preserved:

```javascript
/* eslint-disable no-underscore-dangle */

import expect from 'expect.js'
import {createGenerateId} from '../../src'
import * as moduleId from '../../src/utils/moduleId'
import {resetSheets, resetModuleId} from '../../../../tests/utils'

const sheetMock = {
  options: {
    classNamePrefix: 'p',
    jss: {id: 0}
```

### Resolution rationale:
1. **Semantic compatibility**: Both imports serve distinct purposes
   - `moduleId` appears to be used for core functionality
   - `resetSheets/resetModuleId` are test utilities for state management
   
2. **No functional overlap**: The utilities from both imports are likely used in different parts of the test:
   - `moduleId` probably manages ID generation during tests
   - `reset*` functions likely clean up state between test runs

3. **Complementary functionality**: The test reset utilities might actually depend on the moduleId implementation

The conflict is resolved by keeping both imports since they address different concerns and appear to be used together in the test environment.
