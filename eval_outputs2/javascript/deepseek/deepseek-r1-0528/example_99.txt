The merge conflict arises from different approaches to handling percentage scaling in the `unformat` function. The HEAD version always scales by 0.01, while the other branch introduces conditional scaling based on a configuration option. 

The semantic resolution preserves both intents by:
1. Keeping the conditional logic structure from the other branch
2. Modifying the condition to default to scaling when `scalePercentBy100` is not explicitly set to `false`
3. Maintaining the HEAD's behavior as the default case

This ensures:
- Backward compatibility (HEAD behavior becomes default)
- Configurability (option to disable scaling)
- Standard percentage handling (scaling enabled by default)

Resolved code:
```javascript
            }

            return output;
        },
        unformat: function(string) {
            var number = numeral._.stringToNumber(string);
            if (numeral.options.scalePercentBy100 !== false) {
                return number * 0.01;
            }
            return number;
        }
    });
})();
