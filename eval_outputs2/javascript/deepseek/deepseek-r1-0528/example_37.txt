The merge conflict involves a comment and function definition added between the `getMax` function and the `getMaxY` function. The intent appears to be adding an explanatory comment about using Lodash's `_.max` utility above the `getMaxY` function. However, the conflict is ambiguous because:

1. Both sides define an identical `getMaxY` function
2. The function definitions are incomplete in the snippet
3. It's unclear if the comment belongs to `getMax` or `getMaxY`
4. The duplicate function definitions would cause a syntax error

Since the intent cannot be clearly determined from the provided context, the conflict remains unresolved. The full snippet with preserved conflict markers and spacing is:

```javascript

//iteratee for lodash _.max
    function getMax(v, i){
      return parseFloat(v);
    }
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
//for some reason this loop does not properly get the maxY if there are multiple datasets (was doing 4 datasets that differred wildly)
//just used lodash _.max utility
    function getMaxY() {
      if (self.options.maxY) {
        return self.options.maxY;
      }
>>>>>>> c973213a79bffd07d0ed9175030d09539b8c1d3f

    function getMaxY() {
      if (self.options.maxY) {
        return self.options.maxY;
      }
