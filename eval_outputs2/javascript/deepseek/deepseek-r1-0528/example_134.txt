```javascript
    password: '',
    // Settings: Network encryption mode
    encryptionMode: 'WPA',
    // Settings: Hide password on the printed card
    hidePassword: false,
    // Settings: Mark your network as hidden SSID
    hiddenSSID: false,
    // Settings: Portrait orientation
    portrait: false,
  });
  const [errors, setErrors] = useState({
    ssidError: '',
```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
The merge conflict involves the presence of the `hiddenSSID` setting. Since:
1. The HEAD branch added this new configuration option with a default value
2. The other branch didn't modify or conflict with this setting
3. The property is independent of surrounding settings
4. The comment clearly explains its purpose

The resolution keeps the `hiddenSSID` property as it adds new functionality without conflicting with existing code. The settings remain logically grouped, and the default `false` value ensures backward compatibility with branches that don't use this setting.
