The conflict arises from a trivial difference in string quotation style. Both versions are semantically identical, with the only difference being the use of double quotes (`"string"`) in HEAD versus single quotes (`'string'`) in the other branch. 

Since:
1. The JavaScript engine treats both quotation styles identically
2. The rest of the codebase (as seen in the surrounding context) uses single quotes consistently
3. There's no functional difference between the versions

The resolution maintains consistency with the project's existing code style by selecting the single-quote version. The conflict markers are removed while preserving all other formatting and context exactly as provided.
