const TEST = 'TEST'
const isSSR = process.env.VUE_ENV === 'server'

describe('Store', () => {
```

The conflict remains unresolved because the intent is ambiguous. The differences involve:
1. Different Vue imports (named import `nextTick` vs default import `Vue`)
2. Presence/absence of `mount` helper import
3. Different import paths for Vuex

Without seeing the actual test implementations that use these imports, it's impossible to determine:
- Whether the test requires the Vue instance or just `nextTick`
- If `mount` helper is still needed
- Which Vuex import path is correct for the current project structure

The safest approach is to leave the conflict markers for manual resolution by a developer who understands both the test requirements and project configuration.
