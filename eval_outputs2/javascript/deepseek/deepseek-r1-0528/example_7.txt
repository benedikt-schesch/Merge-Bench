The conflict arises from two different methods of obtaining the current timestamp in milliseconds. Both approaches are semantically equivalent but use different syntax:

1. `new Date().getTime()` (HEAD version) - Creates a Date object then calls its method
2. `Date.now()` (branch version) - Direct static method call

The modern `Date.now()` is preferred as it's more efficient and avoids creating an intermediate Date object. Since both achieve identical results, we can safely choose the more efficient approach. Here's the resolved code:

```javascript

    this.valueRange = { min: chartMinValue, max: chartMaxValue };
  };

  SmoothieChart.prototype.render = function(canvas, time) {
    var nowMillis = Date.now();

    // Respect any frame rate limit.
    if (this.options.limitFPS > 0 && nowMillis - this.lastRenderTimeMillis < (1000/this.options.limitFPS))
      return;


```
