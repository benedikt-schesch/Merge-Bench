The conflict arises from a whitespace difference where one branch adds an empty line after the async IIFE opening, while the other branch doesn't. Since this is purely stylistic and doesn't affect functionality, I've chosen to keep the empty line for consistency with common JavaScript formatting practices.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```javascript
(async () => {

    function is_widget_frame() {
        return document.querySelector('div.check') !== null;
    }
