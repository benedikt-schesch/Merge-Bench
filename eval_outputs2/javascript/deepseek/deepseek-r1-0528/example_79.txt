The conflict arises from two changes:
1. The variable name used in the condition (`program` vs `options`) 
2. The exit code logic when `buildOnce` is true (exit code based on build status vs always exiting with 0)

After analyzing both sides:
1. `options` variable is more current based on the branch name
2. Retaining build error handling is necessary to report build failures

Here's the resolved version preserving all context and spacing:

```javascript
    console.log(colors.red('Error: ' + err.toString()))
  })

  const buildError = await build(inputPath)

  if (options.buildOnce) {
    process.exit(buildError ? 1 : 0)
  } else {
    watch()
  }
}
