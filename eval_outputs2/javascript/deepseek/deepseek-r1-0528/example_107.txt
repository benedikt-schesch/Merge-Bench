The merge conflict involves the `CONSTRUCTORS` object where both branches modified the 'Function' property and one branch added an 'Object' property. The MAPPING object depends on `[]["entries"]()`, which is used in the HEAD branch's 'Object' property. Since the intent behind the changes is ambiguous (why 'Function' was changed to different methods and whether 'Object' is required), and without more context about why these changes were made, it's safer to retain the conflict markers.

```javascript
  const CONSTRUCTORS = {
    'Array':    '[]',
    'Number':   '(+[])',
    'String':   '([]+[])',
    'Boolean':  '(![])',
<<<<<<< HEAD
    'Function': '[]["at"]',
    'RegExp':   'Function("return/"+false+"/")()',
    'Object':	'[]["entries"]()'
=======
    'Function': '[]["flat"]',
    'RegExp':   'Function("return/"+false+"/")()'
>>>>>>> e5c027487a2338bc4452da079781652ffa4573b9
  };

  const MAPPING = {
    'a':   '(false+"")[1]',
    'b':   '([]["entries"]()+"")[2]',
```
