I'll help resolve this semantic merge conflict while preserving the surrounding context exactly. The key issue is that both branches are modifying imports, but they have different intentions:

1. HEAD branch has commented out the type import
2. Other branch adds a new import (`prefixer`) and keeps the type import uncommented

After analyzing the semantics:
- The `prefixer` import from the other branch is likely a new required dependency
- The type import should remain active (uncommented) as it's needed for TypeScript type checking
- The commented version in HEAD appears to be temporary debugging

Here's the resolved version preserving all context:

```javascript
  compat,
  removeLabel,
  createUnsafeSelectorsAlarm,
  incorrectImportAlarm
} from './stylis-plugins'
import { prefixer } from './prefixer'
import type { StylisPlugin } from './types'

let isBrowser = typeof document !== 'undefined'

/*
export type Options = {
```
