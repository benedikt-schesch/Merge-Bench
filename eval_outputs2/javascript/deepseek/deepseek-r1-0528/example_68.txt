I'll return the exact code snippet with the conflict markers as requested since I don't have enough context to resolve the semantic intent behind the conflicting changes. Here's the preserved output:

```javascript
        }

        // Wait for task to be available
        const {task, is_hard, cells, background_url, urls} = await on_task_ready();

<<<<<<< HEAD
        const settings = await BG.exec('Settings.get');
=======
        const settings = await BG.exec('get_settings');
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        if (!settings.enabled || !settings.recaptcha_auto_solve) {
            return;
        }

        const n = cells.length == 9 ? 3 : 4;
```

The conflict appears to be about how to retrieve settings:
1. The HEAD version uses `'Settings.get'`
2. The other branch uses `'get_settings'`

Without knowing:
- The implementation details of the `BG.exec` method
- Which settings retrieval method is current/correct
- Whether this was a refactoring or parallel development
- The broader context of the codebase

I'm preserving the conflict markers exactly as provided. To properly resolve this, we would need to understand:
- If there was a rename of the settings method
- Which version matches the current API
- Whether both methods exist and are equivalent
- The commit history context of both branches
