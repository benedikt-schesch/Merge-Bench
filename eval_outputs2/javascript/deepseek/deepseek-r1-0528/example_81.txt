Here's the resolved snippet with semantic conflict resolution:

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import https from 'https';
import child_process from 'child_process';
import { rimrafSync, copydirSync } from 'sander';
import URL from 'url';
import httpsProxyAgent from 'https-proxy-agent';

const tmpDirName = 'tmp';
const degitConfigName = 'degit.json';

export { degitConfigName };

export class DegitError extends Error {
	constructor(message, opts) {
		super(message);
		Object.assign(this, opts);
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Both sides add important imports - preserved all imports
2. `degitConfigName` constant and export are preserved as they're unique to HEAD
3. Proxy-related imports from the other branch are maintained
4. Constants from HEAD are kept after imports for logical grouping
5. Class definition remains unchanged as it's common to both

This maintains:
- All functional imports from both branches
- HEAD's configuration constants and export
- Proper import grouping convention
- Semantic needs of both branches (file operations + proxy support)
