The conflict arises from two different implementations of the `deleteLine` function. The HEAD version uses the `deleteNearSelection` helper which handles multiple selections and line clipping, while the other branch uses a simpler cursor-based approach. 

The resolution keeps the HEAD version since:
1. It's consistent with the surrounding `delLineLeft` implementation
2. Handles multiple selections better
3. Maintains the existing code pattern

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
          return {from: range.from(), to: range.to()};
        }
      });
    },
    deleteLine: function(cm) {
      deleteNearSelection(cm, function(range) {
        return {from: Pos(range.from().line, 0),
                to: clipPos(cm.doc, Pos(range.to().line + 1, 0))};
      });
    },
    delLineLeft: function(cm) {
      deleteNearSelection(cm, function(range) {
        return {from: Pos(range.from().line, 0), to: range.from()};
      });
```
