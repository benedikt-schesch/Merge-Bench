**Resolution Reasoning:**  
The conflict occurred in a comment header. The HEAD version added "4th commit" while the other branch removed it. Since:
1. The surrounding context shows this is a file header (filename, date, license)
2. "4th commit" appears to be temporary test metadata rather than permanent header information
3. The other branch's removal aligns with keeping only essential header elements

I resolved by removing "4th commit" to maintain a clean, standard header format. The test commit notes above are preserved as they provide historical context, but the specific "4th commit" line seems obsolete when both branches agree on showing the filename/date/license information immediately after the test notes.
