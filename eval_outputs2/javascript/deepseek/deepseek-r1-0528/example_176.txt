The merge conflict involves a difference in whitespace after the comments and before the closing `})();` of an IIFE. Since the only difference is a blank line (which doesn't affect functionality) and the intent is ambiguous (both versions are syntactically valid), the conflict remains unresolved. Here's the original snippet:

```javascript
// #href

//keep adding and testing!


<<<<<<< HEAD
})();
=======

})();
>>>>>>> cb96c26d59e8c3db577701e07b27b3d21962e556
