```javascript
		var PDMVariance = 0.7;

		var relaxation = 0.1;

		var first = true;
		var gettingPosition = false;

		var convergenceLimit = 0.01;

		var learningRate = [];
		var stepParameter = 1.25;
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**  
Both branches introduce valid variable declarations that appear to be independent:
1. `first` (from HEAD) and `gettingPosition` (from other branch) serve different semantic purposes
2. There are no ordering dependencies between these declarations
3. The declarations don't conflict with surrounding variables (`convergenceLimit`, `learningRate`, etc.)  
The merge preserves both declarations since they likely represent complementary functionality rather than mutually exclusive changes. Spacing and context are maintained exactly as provided.
