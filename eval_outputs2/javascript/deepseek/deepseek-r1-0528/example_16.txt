Based on the semantic analysis of both changes, here's the resolved code. Both versions aim to create hook scripts that reference the husky installation, but use different shell parameter expansion techniques to locate the directory path. The `dirname` version (from the incoming branch) is more explicit and widely compatible, making it the better choice for resolution.

```javascript
	})

	f.mkdirSync(_(), { recursive: true })
	w(_('.gitignore'), '*')
	f.copyFileSync(new URL('husky', import.meta.url), _('h'))
	l.forEach(h => w(_(h), `#!/usr/bin/env sh\n. "\$(dirname "\$0")/h"`, { mode: 0o755 }))
	return ''
}
```

Key resolution points:
1. Both versions achieve the same semantic goal - making git hooks invoke husky
2. The `dirname` approach is:
   - More explicit in its directory resolution
   - Better handles edge cases with spaces in paths
   - POSIX-compliant and widely portable
   - Consistent with common shell scripting practices
3. The `${0%/*}` parameter substitution (HEAD version) is valid but:
   - Less readable/maintainable
   - More prone to edge-case issues
   - Less commonly used for this purpose

The resolved version maintains all surrounding context exactly as provided while selecting the semantically superior implementation.
