The merge conflict involves two different methods for retrieving settings: `Settings.get` vs `get_settings`. Without additional context about the codebase's conventions and the BG.exec API, it's impossible to determine which approach is correct. Both sides appear to have the same semantic intent (retrieving settings), but the implementation differs. 

Since the resolution requires knowledge of which method is valid in the current codebase, the conflict remains unresolved. Here's the preserved snippet with the original conflict markers:

```javascript
            await Time.sleep(500);
        }

        const {task, task_url, cells, urls} = await on_task_ready();

<<<<<<< HEAD
        const settings = await BG.exec('Settings.get');

        const settings = await BG.exec('get_settings');

        if (!settings.enabled || !settings.hcaptcha_auto_solve) {
            return;
        }

        const solve_start = Time.time();
```
