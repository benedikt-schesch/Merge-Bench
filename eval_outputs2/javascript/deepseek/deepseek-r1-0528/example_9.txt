Based on the provided snippet and analysis of the conflict:

1. The conflict occurs in the variable declaration section
2. Both versions are identical except for the presence of `consoleErrorMock`
3. The `beforeEach` block doesn't reference `consoleErrorMock` in either version
4. Without additional context about `consoleErrorMock` usage elsewhere, the intent is ambiguous

Since we can't determine if `consoleErrorMock` is needed later in the code, we preserve the conflict as instructed:

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
let act, asyncAct, React, consoleErrorMock
=======
let act, asyncAct, React
>>>>>>> 487eb851d96406557859524eab3fabae82dd3d18

beforeEach(() => {
  jest.resetModules()
  act = require('../pure').act
  asyncAct = require('../act-compat').asyncAct
```
