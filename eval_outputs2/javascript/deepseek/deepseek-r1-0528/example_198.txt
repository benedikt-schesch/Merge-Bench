Since the intent behind the changes is ambiguous without knowing the project's context regarding Flow type annotations and Jest snapshot formatting preferences, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact. Here's the exact code as provided:

```javascript
    :before {
      content: '\00d7';

      "You have illegal escape sequence in your template literal, most likely inside content's property value.
    Because you write your CSS inside a JavaScript string you actually have to do double escaping, so for example "content: '\\00d7';" should become "content: '\\\\00d7';".
