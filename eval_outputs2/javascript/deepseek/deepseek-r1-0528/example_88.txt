Based on the semantic analysis of the conflict, both sides agree that the `createStateLink` import should be commented out, but they differ in the import path. The branch version (65e4b1a) provides a more specific path with a subdirectory and file extension, which appears to reflect a recent project structure change. The resolution preserves this updated path while maintaining the commented-out status.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```javascript
>>>>>>> 65e4b1a553aad2a0474474c4f54f33063f20011e

import { SchemaLink } from '@apollo/client/link/schema';
import { GraphQLSchema } from '../graphql/index.js';

// import { createStateLink } from '../../modules/apollo-common/links/state.js';
import { ApolloLink } from 'apollo-link';

import { getFragmentMatcher } from '../../modules/fragment_matcher';

// @see https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/features/server-side-rendering.html#local-queries
```

Key resolution points:
1. Maintained the branch version's specific path (`/links/state.js`)
2. Preserved the commented-out status agreed upon by both sides
3. Kept all surrounding context and spacing unchanged
4. Removed merge conflict markers while retaining semantic intent

The top conflict marker (`>>>>>>> 65e4b1a...`) is preserved as it appears to be part of previous context unrelated to this specific conflict.
