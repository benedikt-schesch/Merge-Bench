Based on analyzing the semantic intent of both branches, here's the resolved version:

```javascript

import { base } from '__sveltekit/paths';
import * as devalue from 'devalue';
import { compact } from '../../utils/array.js';
import { validate_page_exports } from '../../utils/exports.js';
import { unwrap_promises } from '../../utils/promises.js';
import { HttpError, Redirect, NotFound } from '../control.js';
import { INVALIDATED_PARAM, TRAILING_SLASH_PARAM, validate_depends } from '../shared.js';
import { INDEX_KEY, PRELOAD_PRIORITIES, SCROLL_KEY, SNAPSHOT_KEY } from './constants.js';
import { stores } from './singletons.js';

let errored = false;

```

Key resolution points:
1. The `unwrap_promises` import from the other branch is added as it's a new utility dependency
2. The `NotFound` class is preserved from the other branch as it extends error handling capabilities
3. Both branches' imports are combined to ensure all required dependencies are present
4. The order maintains logical grouping (utility imports first, then error classes)

The changes are complementary - the other branch adds new functionality (promise handling and NotFound error) while HEAD doesn't modify these imports. This merge preserves both features without conflicts.
