The conflict involves adding version history entries. Both changes are additive and non-conflicting in intent - they simply add new version entries to the changelog. The resolution combines both sets of changes while maintaining chronological order.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```javascript
 * v1.29: Support responsive sizing, by @drewnoakes
 * v1.29.1: Include types in package, and make property optional, by @TrentHouliston
 * v1.30: Fix inverted logic in devicePixelRatio support, by @scanlime
 * v1.31: Support tooltips, by @Sly1024 and @drewnoakes
 * v1.32: Support frame rate limit, by @dpuyosa
 * v1.33: Use Date static method instead of instance, by @nnnoel
 *        Fix bug with tooltips when multiple charts on a page, by @jpmbiz70
 */

;(function(exports) {
```

Key resolution points:
1. Maintained all version history entries from both branches
2. Preserved chronological order (v1.32 â†’ v1.33)
3. Kept the indentation and formatting of the tooltip fix note
4. Removed merge conflict markers while keeping all content
5. Preserved surrounding context exactly as provided

The solution combines both sets of changes since they represent sequential updates to the changelog with no semantic overlap or conflict.
