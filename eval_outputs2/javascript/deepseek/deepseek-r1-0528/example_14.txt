I'll resolve this conflict by preserving both properties while maintaining logical grouping. The key is to recognize that both branches are defining the same properties with identical values, but in different orders. Since order doesn't matter semantically in JavaScript objects, I'll choose the most logical grouping:

```javascript
        body = document.body;

        var defaults = {
            duration: undefined,
            mainAudio: false,
            preloadAudio: true,
            loopAudio: true,
            endAudio: false
        };

        options = extendParameters(options, defaults);
        

```

Here's why this resolution works:
1. Both sides agree on `preloadAudio` and `loopAudio` values
2. Both sides include `endAudio: false` 
3. Grouping audio-related properties (`mainAudio`, `preloadAudio`, `loopAudio`) together before `endAudio` creates logical cohesion
4. Maintains all functionality from both branches
5. Preserves proper JavaScript object syntax without trailing commas

The resolution keeps the audio configuration properties grouped together while maintaining the additional `endAudio` property from both branches, all with their correct values.
