```javascript
test('natural() throws an error if min > max', t => {
    const fn = () => chance.natural({ min: 1000, max: 500 })
    t.throws(fn, 'Chance: Min cannot be greater than Max.')
})

test('natural() throws an error if numerals is less than 1', t => {
    const fn = () => chance.natural({ numerals: 0 })
    t.throws(fn, 'Chance: Numerals cannot be less than one.')
})

test('set() works as expected', t => {
    let cData = { lastNames: ['customName', 'testLast'] }
    chance.set(cData)
    let data = chance.get('lastNames')
    t.true(_.isArray(data))
```

Resolution rationale:
1. Both test cases are valid and independent - one tests min/max validation while the other tests numerals validation
2. The tests are logically grouped (both test natural() error cases)
3. The ordering is preserved from the incoming change since it maintains:
   - min/max test first
   - numerals test second
   - set() test last
4. No semantic overlap exists between the test cases
5. All context spacing is preserved exactly as in the original snippet
