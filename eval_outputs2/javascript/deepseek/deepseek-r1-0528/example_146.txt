Here's the resolved snippet preserving context and semantics, with the conflict resolved based on intent analysis:

```javascript
      pushPendingSelection(doc, doc.history.done);
      doc.history.atomicSelection = false;
    }

    var move = operation(cm, function(e) {
      if ((ie && !ie_lt10) ?  !e.buttons : !e_button(e)) done(e);
      else extend(e);
    });
    var up = operation(cm, done);
    on(document, "mousemove", move);
    on(document, "mouseup", up);
```

**Resolution rationale:**  
The conflict arises from different IE version handling conditions. Both versions aim to:
1. Use standard `e.buttons` check for modern browsers
2. Fall back to `e_button(e)` for legacy browsers

The branch version (`e1cfb7f`) provides more precise handling:
- Uses `!e.buttons` only for IE10+ (`ie && !ie_lt10`)
- Uses `e_button` fallback for IE9- and non-IE browsers
- Maintains proper parenthesis balance
- Preserves the original spacing and ternary structure

The HEAD version's `!ie_upto8` check became redundant after the branch's more specific version detection. The resolved version maintains cross-browser compatibility while handling IE versions more accurately.
