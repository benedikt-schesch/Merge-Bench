Based on the analysis, both sides of the conflict only introduce a blank line with identical spacing. Since there's no functional difference, the conflict can be resolved by keeping a single blank line while preserving the surrounding context exactly.

```javascript
            req[1] = inode.qid;

            req[2] = inode.mode;
            req[3] = inode.uid; // user id
            req[4] = inode.gid; // group id

            req[5] = inode.nlinks; // number of hard links
            req[6] = (inode.major<<8) | (inode.minor); // device id low
            req[7] = inode.size; // size low
            req[8] = this.BLOCKSIZE;
            req[9] = Math.floor(inode.size/512+1); // blk size low
```
