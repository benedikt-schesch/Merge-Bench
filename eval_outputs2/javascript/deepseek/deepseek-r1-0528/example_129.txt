The conflict arises from one branch adding a call to `ctx.disable_image_smoothing()` after setting canvas dimensions, while the other branch doesn't have this call. The added method is likely intended to optimize rendering quality for pixel-art applications. Since it doesn't conflict with existing operations and both branches share identical subsequent code, we can safely incorporate this change while preserving the blank line after it for readability.

Resolved code:
```javascript
	undos = [];
	redos = [];

	canvas.width = my_canvas_width;
	canvas.height = my_canvas_height;
	ctx.disable_image_smoothing();
	
	ctx.fillStyle = colors.background;
	ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

	$canvas_area.trigger("resize");
}
```
