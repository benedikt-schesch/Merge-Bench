```javascript
    io.register_write(this.port | EN0_RSARHI, this, function(data_byte)
    {
        var pg = this.get_page();
        if(pg === 0)
        {
            dbg_log("Write remote start address high: " + h(data_byte, 2), LOG_NET);
            this.rsar = this.rsar & 0xFF | data_byte << 8 & 0xFF00;
        }
        else
        {
            dbg_log("Unimplemented: Write pg" + pg + "/09 " + h(data_byte, 2), LOG_NET);
```

**Resolution Explanation:**  
The conflict occurred in the debug log message for register writes. Both branches intended to log writes to the remote start address register's high byte (`EN0_RSARHI`), but had inconsistent descriptions:
- HEAD used "start address count high" (misleading - no "count" involved)
- Other branch used "remote start address low" (incorrect - this is the **high** byte register)

The resolution:
1. Uses "remote start address" (semantically accurate, from the other branch)
2. Uses "high" (correct register designation, from HEAD)
3. Drops "count" (misleading) and "low" (incorrect)  
This preserves the register's purpose while fixing both branches' inaccuracies. The bitwise operation (`data_byte << 8`) confirms we're handling the high byte.
