```javascript
			fulfil();
		});
	});
}

describe('degit', () => {
	beforeEach(function() {
		// CI takes a while to churn through these.
		this.timeout(7500);
	});

	function compare(dir, files) {
		const expected = glob.sync('**', { cwd: dir });
		assert.deepEqual(Object.keys(files).sort(), expected.sort());
```

**Resolution Explanation:**
- Adopted the arrow function syntax for `describe` as it's more modern
- Kept the `beforeEach` hook from the incoming branch to handle timeouts per test
- Preserved the CI timeout comment explaining the 7500ms value
- Maintained the function expression in `beforeEach` to access Mocha's `this` context
- Removed the suite-level timeout (`this.timeout(timeout)`) as it's replaced by the more granular per-test timeout

This resolution:
1. Addresses CI timing needs with per-test timeout configuration
2. Maintains test readability with the explanatory comment
3. Uses consistent modern syntax (arrow function for describe)
4. Preserves all surrounding context and spacing exactly as provided
