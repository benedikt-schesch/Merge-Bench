The merge conflict involves a single blank line difference between the branches. The HEAD branch includes a blank line for better visual separation between code blocks, while the other branch removes it. Since this is purely a formatting preference that doesn't affect functionality, and the blank line improves readability by separating distinct code sections, the resolution keeps the blank line from HEAD.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```javascript
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
            });
        }
    }

    /**
     * Locate element
     */

    for (const $e of document.querySelectorAll('.locate')) {
```

Key resolution points:
1. The blank line from HEAD is preserved for better visual separation
2. All functional code remains unchanged
3. The conflict markers are removed while maintaining the original spacing
4. The surrounding context is preserved exactly as provided

The resolution maintains semantics while improving readability through consistent whitespace usage. The first line with the conflict marker remains as it's part of the surrounding context and not part of the conflict being resolved.
