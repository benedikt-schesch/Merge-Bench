```javascript
    frontMatterTitleField: 'title',
    spellcheck: false,
    enableSmartPaste: false,
    enableMarkdownLint: false,
    customMarkdownLintConfig: DEFAULT_MARKDOWN_LINT_CONFIG,
    dateFormatISO8601: false,
    prettierConfig: `{
      "trailingComma": "es5",
      "tabWidth": 2,
      "semi": false,
      "singleQuote": true
    }`,
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. Both branches add configuration properties that are unrelated and can coexist:
   - `dateFormatISO8601` is a new setting added by one branch
   - `prettierConfig` is modified by both branches but only differs in whitespace
   
2. The space after the backtick in `prettierConfig` is functionally insignificant since:
   - It's outside the JSON structure
   - Doesn't affect template literal behavior
   - The HEAD version without space is cleaner

3. Maintaining both settings preserves the semantic intent of:
   - Adding date format configuration
   - Providing Prettier configuration
   - Keeping all settings syntactically valid

The resolution maintains all functionality while choosing the most concise syntax for the Prettier configuration string.
