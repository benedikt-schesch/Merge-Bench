I'll resolve this merge conflict by selecting the most recent update date. Here's the resolved snippet:

### Resolution Explanation:
- Both branches are updating the same comment line for the script's modification date
- `2022.1.24` (from branch `cd99a7a8c7a06a5eb9a9a304f55d1aa70bbcf2fa`) is chronologically newer than `2021.12.4` (from HEAD)
- This preserves the most recent update information
- All surrounding context remains unchanged as requested
- The conflict markers have been removed while maintaining original spacing
