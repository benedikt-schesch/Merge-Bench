The merge conflict involves conflicting changes to the import statements. The HEAD branch requires `nextTick` and `mount`, while the other branch requires the Vue default import. Since these changes conflict semantically (one adds imports while the other replaces them), and without additional context about why the other branch removed `nextTick` and `mount`, it's ambiguous whether these are still needed. 

The conflict cannot be automatically resolved due to:
1. The semantic conflict between added and removed imports
2. Potential dependency on both sets of imports in different parts of the code
3. Lack of context about the removal of `mount` and `nextTick`

Here is the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
import { nextTick } from 'vue'
import { mount } from './support/helpers'
=======
import Vue from 'vue'
>>>>>>> ce0c88a81703017cad63e4b5a913eff6349f585a
import Vuex from '../../src/index'

const TEST = 'TEST'
const isSSR = process.env.VUE_ENV === 'server'


```
