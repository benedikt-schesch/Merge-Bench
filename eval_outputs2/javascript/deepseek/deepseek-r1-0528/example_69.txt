Based on the semantic analysis of both changes, here's the resolved version preserving context and intent:

```javascript
        });
        if (!data) {
            return;
        }

        let delay = parseInt(settings.recaptcha_solve_delay_time);
        delay = delay ? delay : 1000;
        const delta = settings.recaptcha_solve_delay ? (delay - (Time.time() - solve_start)) : 0;
        if (delta > 0) {
            await Time.sleep(delta);
        }

        // Submit solution
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. The HEAD version provides configurable delay handling through `settings.recaptcha_solve_delay_time`
2. The ternary `delay = delay ? delay : 1000` safely handles invalid/undefined values
3. Maintains the calculation pattern `(delay - (Time.time() - solve_start))` from both branches
4. Preserves the conditional sleep functionality required by both versions
5. The solution keeps the flexibility of configurable delays while maintaining the same fallback behavior (1000ms) as the other branch

The conflict is resolved by keeping the more flexible configuration approach from HEAD while maintaining the core delay calculation semantics from both branches.
