The conflict arises from differences in naming and spelling for the cache implementation. Both sides aim to create a 1-second cache using LRU, but use slightly different names (`pageCache` vs `microCache`) and spellings ("micro-cache" vs "microcache"). The rest of the configuration (`max: 100`, `maxAge: 1000`) is identical.

Since the following comment references "micro-cacheable" (with a hyphen), we should maintain consistency by:
1. Using the hyphenated spelling "micro-cache" in comments
2. Keeping `pageCache` as the variable name since it's more descriptive of what's being cached (pages)

Here's the resolved snippet:

```javascript
app.use('/dist', serve('./dist', true))
app.use('/public', serve('./public', true))
app.use('/manifest.json', serve('./manifest.json', true))
app.use('/service-worker.js', serve('./dist/service-worker.js'))

// 1-second micro-cache.
// https://www.nginx.com/blog/benefits-of-microcaching-nginx/
const pageCache = LRU({
  max: 100,
  maxAge: 1000
})

// since this app has no user-specific content, every page is micro-cacheable.
```
