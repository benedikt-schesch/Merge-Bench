The conflict involves whitespace differences between two branches. The HEAD branch added two blank lines before the comment, while the other branch removed these blank lines. Since the changes are purely stylistic (whitespace only) and don't affect functionality, the resolution keeps the more compact formatting by removing the extra blank lines. This maintains semantic consistency while avoiding unnecessary whitespace.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```javascript
            const $tab = document.querySelector(`[data-tab="${$e.dataset.tabtarget}"]`);
            $tab.classList.remove('hidden');
        });
    }
    /**
     * Navigate backwards on mouse back or backspace
     */

    function back() {
```
