The merge conflict involves registering read handlers for ports `0x3D4` and `0x3D5`. The HEAD branch registers both ports with simple handler references, while the other branch modifies the `0x3D5` handler to include logging for 16-bit reads and omits the `0x3D4` registration. Since the intent behind removing `0x3D4` in the other branch is ambiguous (could be intentional or an oversight), and both changes affect adjacent lines, the conflict cannot be safely resolved automatically. The original conflict is preserved below:

```javascript
    io.register_read(0x3C9, this, this.port3C9_read);

    io.register_read(0x3CC, this, this.port3CC_read);

    io.register_write_consecutive(0x3D4, this, this.port3D4_write, this.port3D5_write);
<<<<<<< HEAD
    io.register_read(0x3D4, this, this.port3D4_read);
    io.register_read(0x3D5, this, this.port3D5_read);
=======
    io.register_read(0x3D5, this, this.port3D5_read, () => {
        dbg_log("Warning: 16-bit read from 3D5", LOG_VGA);
        return this.port3D5_read();
    });
>>>>>>> 8107f26f1056279286f37db2b6230ebf1bd634a0

    io.register_read(0x3CA, this, function() { dbg_log("3CA read", LOG_VGA); return 0; });

    io.register_read(0x3DA, this, this.port3DA_read);
    io.register_read(0x3BA, this, this.port3DA_read);
