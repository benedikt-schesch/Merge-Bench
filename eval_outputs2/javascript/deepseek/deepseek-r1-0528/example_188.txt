Based on the semantic analysis of both changes:

1. The HEAD change wraps the callback in a 100ms setTimeout, which might be a workaround for timing/rendering issues
2. The other branch uses a direct callback which is cleaner but might not account for rendering delays

Since both approaches have different intentions and we don't have enough context to determine which solution is correct, the conflict should be preserved. Here's the unchanged snippet:

```javascript

    canvasToTempFilePath(opt) {
      if (!opt.canvasId) {
        opt.canvasId = this.data.canvasId;
      }
<<<<<<< HEAD
      
      ctx.draw(true, setTimeout( () => {
=======

      ctx.draw(true, () => {
>>>>>>> f99054b9c36438f416500bf451d687ae2d47ec77
        wx.canvasToTempFilePath(opt, this);
      }, 100));
    },

    touchStart(e) {

```
