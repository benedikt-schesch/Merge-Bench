```

The conflict remains unresolved because both changes represent valid version formats with ambiguous intent:
- The HEAD version (`February 2021`) uses a month-year format
- The branch version (`20 February 2021`) uses a day-month-year format

Since there's no semantic way to determine whether the day component is required or which version is more accurate without additional context, the conflict markers are preserved for manual resolution. The surrounding context remains unchanged as instructed.
