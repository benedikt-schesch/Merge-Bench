The conflict arises from differing import statements for testing utilities. The HEAD branch uses Node.js built-in modules (`node:assert` and `node:test`) while the other branch uses the `uvu` testing library. The surrounding context shows the code uses `describe` which is only available in the `node:test` module. Additionally, the file uses ESM syntax (`import`) consistently, making the `require` statements from the other branch incompatible.

Resolution:
1. Keep the HEAD imports since they provide `describe` and match the ESM syntax
2. Remove the conflicting `uvu` imports as they would cause syntax errors
3. Preserve the rest of the context unchanged

Resolved code:
```javascript
import { equal, match, notEqual, ok } from 'node:assert'
import { describe, test } from 'node:test'

import { urlAlphabet } from '../index.js'
import { customAlphabet, nanoid } from '../non-secure/index.js'

describe('non secure', () => {

```
