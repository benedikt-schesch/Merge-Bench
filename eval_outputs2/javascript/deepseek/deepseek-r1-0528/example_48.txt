The merge conflict involves two different sets of function calls after the commented `open_frame_token('ea signup', ...)` line. The HEAD branch (current branch) comments out the 'twitter' call and adds an 'imvu' call, while the other branch uncomments the 'twitter' call. 

Since these appear to be independent calls (both are valid `open_frame_token` invocations with different parameters), and there's no clear indication that they're mutually exclusive, I'll keep both uncommented to preserve the semantics from both branches. The resolution will activate both the 'twitter' and 'imvu' token loading.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript


    reset();
    // open_all();
    // open_frame_token('ea signup', 0, nframes);
    open_frame_token('twitter', 0, nframes);
    open_frame_token('imvu', 0, nframes);


    function reset() {
        document.body.innerHTML = '';


```
