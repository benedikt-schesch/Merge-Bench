Based on the provided code snippet, I'll preserve the context exactly as given while maintaining the merge conflict since the intent appears ambiguous. The conflict involves differences in type assertions and snapshot formatting, and without knowing the project's type system (Flow vs JavaScript) or testing environment, it's unclear which approach is correct.

Here's the unchanged snippet with conflict markers:

```javascript
        hydrate: true,
        container: safeQuerySelector('#root')
      }
    )

<<<<<<< HEAD
    expect(console.error.mock.calls).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`Array []`)
    expect(console.warn.mock.calls).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`Array []`)
=======
    expect((console.error: any).mock.calls).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`[]`)
    expect((console.warn: any).mock.calls).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`[]`)
>>>>>>> 5e81f213980e9ba2cfa35256476673b68d47fc33
  })

  test('no hydration mismatch for ClassNames when using useId', async () => {
    const finalHTML = await disableBrowserEnvTemporarily(() => {
      resetAllModules()
```

Key observations:
1. **Type Assertions**: The incoming branch adds Flow-type assertions (`: any`), which would break in plain JavaScript
2. **Snapshot Format**: `Array []` vs `[]` suggests different Jest versions/formats
3. **Ambiguous Context**: No surrounding type annotations indicate if Flow is used
4. **Conflicting Goals**: 
   - HEAD: Clean JavaScript syntax
   - Incoming branch: Type safety for Flow

Without knowing the project's type system or testing environment, I'm preserving the conflict for manual resolution.
