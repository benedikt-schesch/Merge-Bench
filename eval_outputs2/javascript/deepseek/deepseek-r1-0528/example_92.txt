The conflict involves different asset hashes for `index.js` between branches. Since these are build artifacts generated by Webpack, the correct resolution requires rebuilding the assets after merging source code changes. Without rebuilding, it's ambiguous which version should be kept as both represent valid builds from their respective branches. 

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
window.WEBPACK_ASSETS = {"index.js":{"js":"index@e45a4de49431db58f52c.js","css":"index@e45a4de49431db58f52c.css"},"lib":{"js":"lib@aaed0f9bfcc4ff921c5a.js"},"lib2":{"js":"lib2@819909a89ca45b94d9bf.js"},"lib3":{"js":"lib3@93b22d7460620277a5da.js"},"manifest":{"js":"manifest@f2f4bd774d6c221b3d5f.js"}}

```

**Recommended resolution workflow**:
1. Resolve any conflicts in source files (e.g., `src/index.js`)
2. Rebuild assets using Webpack to generate updated hashes
3. Commit the new `WEBPACK_ASSETS` generated by the build tool

Manual merging of build artifacts is discouraged as it could result in incorrect file references.
