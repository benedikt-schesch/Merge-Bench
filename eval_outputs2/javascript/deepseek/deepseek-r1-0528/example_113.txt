The conflict involves a trailing comma after the `backendRetries` property. Both versions define the same validator function, but one includes a trailing comma while the other does not. Given that all other properties in the object use trailing commas for consistency, and modern JavaScript allows trailing commas in object literals, the version with the trailing comma should be chosen to maintain consistency and ease future additions.

Here's the resolved snippet:

```javascript
    port: checkValidPort,
    callbackPort: checkValidPort,
    bootstrapPort: checkValidPort,
    chromedriverPort: checkValidPort,
    robotPort: checkValidPort,
    backendRetries: (r) => r >= 0,
  };

  const nonDefaultArgs = getNonDefaultArgs(parser, args);

  for (let [arg, validator] of _.toPairs(validations)) {
```
