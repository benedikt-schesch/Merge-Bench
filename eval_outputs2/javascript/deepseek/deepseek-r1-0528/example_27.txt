The conflict arises from differing approaches to determining cacheability. The HEAD branch unconditionally enables caching (`true`), while the other branch introduces a configurable flag (`useMicroCache`). Since the comment indicates this app has no user-specific content (making all pages cacheable), but we also want to respect configuration flags, the solution is to:

1. Use `useMicroCache` if defined (for configurable behavior)
2. Fall back to `true` (original behavior) if the flag isn't defined

This preserves both the original safety (caching when no configuration exists) and the new configurability.

Resolved code:
```javascript

// since this app has no user-specific content, every page is micro-cacheable.
// if your app involves user-specific content, you need to implement custom
// logic to determine whether a request is cacheable based on its url and
// headers.
const isCacheable = req => (typeof useMicroCache !== 'undefined' ? useMicroCache : true)

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  if (!renderer) {
    return res.end('waiting for compilation... refresh in a moment.')
  }

```
