I'll resolve this merge conflict by selecting the higher version number since it represents a more recent update. The semantic intent here is to maintain the most current version information.

```javascript

 */
!function(e, t) {
    if ("object" == typeof exports && "object" == typeof module) module.exports = t(); else if ("function" == typeof define && define.amd) define([], t); else {
        var n = t();
        for (var i in n) ("object" == typeof exports ? exports : e)[i] = n[i];
```

Reasoning:
1. Both versions are valid semantic version strings (`5.0.10-beta.x`)
2. The higher beta version (14) supersedes the older beta version (10)
3. This preserves the intended versioning scheme while taking the most recent update
4. All surrounding context remains unchanged as requested
5. Conflict markers are removed while maintaining the correct comment structure

The resolution keeps the version that reflects the latest development state while maintaining identical formatting and structure in the surrounding code.
