Based on the semantic analysis of both changes, here's the resolved version combining both intents:

1. The null assignment should include all four variables (`d.cachedCharWidth`, `d.cachedTextHeight`, `d.cachedPaddingH`, and `knownScrollbarWidth`) as they're all cache-clearing operations
2. The incoming change's `clearCaches()` and `runInOp()` operations provide a more comprehensive cache reset and change registration
3. The HEAD's `cm.setSize()` call is redundant with the more thorough operations in the incoming change

```javascript
    var resizeTimer;
    function onResize() {
      if (resizeTimer == null) resizeTimer = setTimeout(function() {
        resizeTimer = null;
        // Might be a text scaling operation, clear size caches.
        d.cachedCharWidth = d.cachedTextHeight = d.cachedPaddingH = knownScrollbarWidth = null;
        clearCaches(cm);
        runInOp(cm, bind(regChange, cm));
      }, 100);
    }
    on(window, "resize", onResize);
    // The above handler holds on to the editor and its data
    // structures. Here we poll to unregister it when the editor is no
```
