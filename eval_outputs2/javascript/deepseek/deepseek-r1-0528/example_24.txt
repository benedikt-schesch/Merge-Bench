The merge conflict remains unresolved as the intent is ambiguous. Both changes appear to update the template version, but without additional context about versioning policies or whether this was an intentional upgrade, it's unclear which version should take precedence. 

The semantic meaning differs significantly:
- `1.1.3` suggests a patch-level update
- `1.2.0` indicates a minor feature update

Since version numbers in comments typically serve as documentation rather than functional code, and without knowing the project's versioning strategy or which branch represents the more recent/authoritative change, this requires human judgment to resolve.
