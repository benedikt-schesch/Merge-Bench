I'll help resolve this merge conflict while preserving the context and spacing. The conflict is about whether to include the `log` import from './log.js'. After analyzing both sides:

1. The other branch (a17de68) added the log import
2. The HEAD branch doesn't have this import
3. Since log utilities are typically used throughout a codebase, and the import location is consistent with other relative imports, it should be included

Here's the resolved snippet with all original spacing preserved:

```javascript
 * robust as jquery's, so there's probably some differences.
 */

import * as Dom from './dom.js';
import * as Guid from './guid.js';
import log from './log.js';
import window from 'global/window';
import document from 'global/document';

/**
```

The resolution:
- Kept the log import since it's likely needed for logging functionality
- Maintained the consistent grouping of relative imports first
- Preserved all surrounding context and spacing exactly as provided
- Removed the merge conflict markers while keeping the intended functionality from both branches
