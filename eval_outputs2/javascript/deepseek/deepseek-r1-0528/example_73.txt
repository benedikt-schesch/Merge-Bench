Based on the provided merge conflict snippet, I've analyzed both changes:

1. The HEAD version contains no content between the async wrapper and function definition
2. The incoming commit (07dbd1e) adds two blank lines before the function

After considering semantic intent:
- Both versions define the same `is_present()` function
- The conflict is purely about whitespace formatting
- Without additional context about project style guidelines, the intent is ambiguous
- The conflict cannot be automatically resolved

Here's the preserved snippet with the conflict markers:

```javascript
(async () => {
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======


>>>>>>> 07dbd1e26d1216651e65a3147e9c3171dce485de
    function is_present(settings) {
        try {
            return document.querySelector(settings.ocr_image_selector) !== null && document.querySelector(settings.ocr_input_selector) !== null;
        } catch (e) {}
        return false;
```
