Based on the provided context, the conflict arises from different testing approaches: Jasmine vs Jest for spy creation, and a custom `mount` function vs direct Vue instance creation. Here's the semantic resolution:

```javascript
          expect(getters.count).toBe(value)
        }
      }
    })

    const spy = jest.fn()

    const vm = mount(store, {
      computed: {
        a: () => store.getters.count
      },
      watch: {
        a: spy
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. **Spy creation (`jest.fn()`):**  
   Prefer `jest.fn()` as it's more modern and commonly used in Vue/Jest testing ecosystems. The Jasmine spy (`jasmine.createSpy()`) appears to be legacy.

2. **Vue instance initialization (`mount(store, {...})`):**  
   Retain the custom `mount` function since it likely handles store injection properly. The branch's `new Vue({...})` approach lacks store binding and might break reactivity.

The resolved version maintains the correct store binding while modernizing the test spy utility.
