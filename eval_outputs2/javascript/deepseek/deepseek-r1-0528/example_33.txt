The merge conflict involves importing different entities from the 'vue' package. The HEAD branch imports `nextTick` while the other branch imports the default `Vue` object. Since the subsequent code imports Vuex and sets up a test suite, it's unclear whether the test relies on `Vue` or `nextTick` specifically. Without additional context about the test implementation, the intent is ambiguous.

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
import { nextTick } from 'vue'
=======
import Vue from 'vue'
>>>>>>> ce0c88a81703017cad63e4b5a913eff6349f585a
import Vuex from '../../src/index'

const TEST = 'TEST'

describe('Modules', () => {
```
