The conflict is about a single newline between the end of one function and the start of another. Both sides are functionally identical, but the other branch adds an extra newline for better code readability. Since this doesn't change behavior and aligns with common coding practices, we'll keep the extra newline.

Resolved code:
```javascript
        : selectedValue
    } else {
      return null
    }
  }

function validateRequestBodyIsRequired(selector) {
  return (...args) =>
    (system) => {
      const specJson = system.getSystem().specSelectors.specJson()
```
