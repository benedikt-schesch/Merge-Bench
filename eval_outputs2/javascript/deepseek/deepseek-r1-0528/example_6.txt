The merge conflict centers around two different approaches to generating a timestamp for the animation frame callback. Both versions achieve the same semantic goal (providing a timestamp), but use different methods with compatibility implications:

1. **HEAD version (`callback(new Date().getTime())`**  
   Uses `Date` object method, compatible with very old browsers (including IE8 and earlier)

2. **Incoming branch (`callback(Date.now())`)**  
   Uses modern `Date.now()` method (faster/cleaner) but only supported in IE9+ and modern browsers

Since we don't have context about browser support requirements, this is ambiguous. The conflict is preserved as instructed:

```javascript
            window.mozRequestAnimationFrame     ||
            window.oRequestAnimationFrame       ||
            window.msRequestAnimationFrame      ||
            function(callback) {
              return window.setTimeout(function() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
                callback(new Date().getTime());
=======
                callback(Date.now());
>>>>>>> be83c580c37d0c6182b008a7bf086541530398b8
              }, 16);
            };
          return requestAnimationFrame.call(window, callback, element);
        },
        cancelAnimationFrame = function(id) {
```
