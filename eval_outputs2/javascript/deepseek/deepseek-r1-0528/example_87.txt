To resolve this merge conflict, we need to combine the import statements for ApolloClient and InMemoryCache from both branches. The current conflict exists because:

1. The HEAD branch uses two separate import statements:
   ```javascript
   import { ApolloClient } from '@apollo/client';
   import { InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client/cache';
   ```

2. The other branch uses a single combined import statement:
   ```javascript
   import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';
   ```

Both approaches are functionally equivalent, but the combined import is more concise. Since there's no semantic difference and both import styles are valid, we'll prefer the more compact form to reduce redundancy.

Additionally, we need to preserve the exact whitespace and formatting of the surrounding context, including the unresolved conflict at the end of the snippet.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
 * (necessary for SSR)
 *
 * /!\ It must be recreated on every request
 */

import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

import { SchemaLink } from '@apollo/client/link/schema';
import { GraphQLSchema } from '../graphql/index.js';

<<<<<<< HEAD
