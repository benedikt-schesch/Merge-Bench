```javascript
			var vecpos = new Array(2);
		}
		var pw, pl, pdataLength;

		var facecheck_count = 0;
<<<<<<< HEAD
		
		var webglFi, svmFi, mosseCalc, jf;

		var scoringCanvas = document.createElement('canvas');
		//document.body.appendChild(scoringCanvas);
		var scoringContext = scoringCanvas.getContext('2d');
		var msxmin, msymin, msxmax, msymax;
```

**Reasoning**:  
The conflict involves variable declarations where HEAD adds `jf` while the other branch doesn't. Since there's no surrounding context showing usage of these variables, the intent is ambiguous:
- `jf` might be a necessary new variable (HEAD)
- Or its removal might be a cleanup (other branch)

Without seeing how these variables are used later in the code, I cannot determine which change should take precedence. Per the instructions, I preserve the conflict markers when intent is unclear.
