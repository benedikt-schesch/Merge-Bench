The conflict involves importing different testing libraries and assertion methods. Both sides aim to set up testing utilities, but they use incompatible modules:

1. **HEAD version** uses Node.js built-in modules (`node:assert` and `node:test`)
2. **Other branch** uses third-party `uvu` testing library

The surrounding context shows the test suite runs for both Node.js and browser environments. The `uvu` version (other branch) is better suited for cross-environment testing, but its CommonJS syntax (`require`) conflicts with the ES module syntax (`import`) used in the context. Since the file uses ES modules elsewhere, the `require` syntax is invalid here.

Given this ambiguity and the instruction to preserve conflicts when unsure, I'm returning the original unresolved snippet:

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
import { equal, match, notEqual, ok } from 'node:assert'
import { after, before, describe, test } from 'node:test'
=======
let { test } = require('uvu')
let { is, ok, equal, match, not } = require('uvu/assert')

import * as browser from '../index.browser.js'
import * as node from '../index.js'

for (let type of ['node', 'browser']) {
