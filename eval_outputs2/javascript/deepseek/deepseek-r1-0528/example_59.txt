Based on the semantic analysis, I've resolved the conflict by preserving both important changes:

1. Using the updated settings retrieval method from the merge branch (`get_settings`)
2. Keeping the debug logging from the HEAD branch
3. Maintaining consistent code style and formatting

Here's the resolved snippet:

```javascript
    rendering_server_plan = false;
}


async function init_ui() {
    const settings = await BG.exec('get_settings');
    console.log('settings', settings);

    /**
     * Power button
     */


```

**Resolution rationale:**
- The merge branch's `get_settings` appears to be an updated API call (more semantic naming)
- The HEAD branch's `console.log` is valuable debugging information worth keeping
- Both changes are semantically compatible and serve different purposes
- The empty line after the log statement is preserved for consistent formatting
- No other context was modified to maintain integrity
