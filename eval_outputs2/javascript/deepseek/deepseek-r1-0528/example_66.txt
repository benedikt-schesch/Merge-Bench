Based on the provided code snippet, I've analyzed the merge conflict and determined that the intent is ambiguous without broader context. Both changes appear to be trying to update settings through a backend call, but the method names (`Settings.set` vs `set_settings`) suggest a possible API refactoring that isn't visible in this snippet.

Since I can't determine which method name is correct without knowing the current API contract of the `BG.exec` function, I'm returning the unresolved conflict as requested:

```javascript
            $toggle.classList.remove('on', 'off');
            $toggle.classList.add(v ? 'on' : 'off');
            // Listen
            $toggle.addEventListener('click', async () => {
                const value = $toggle.classList.contains('off');
<<<<<<< HEAD
                await BG.exec('Settings.set', {id: k, value: value});
=======
                await BG.exec('set_settings', {id: k, value: value});
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
                $toggle.classList.remove('on', 'off');
                $toggle.classList.add(value ? 'on' : 'off');
            });
        }


```

Key reasons for leaving it unresolved:
1. Both versions are semantically equivalent in their purpose (updating settings)
2. The method name difference suggests an API change that isn't visible in this context
3. The surrounding code doesn't provide clues about the correct API format
4. Choosing one over the other might break functionality depending on which API version is current

To properly resolve this:
1. Check recent changes to the `BG.exec` API
2. Verify which method name (`Settings.set` or `set_settings`) currently exists
3. Look for other usage examples in the codebase
4. Consult commit messages from both branches for context about the change
