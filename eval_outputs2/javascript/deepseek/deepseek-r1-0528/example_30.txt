Based on analyzing the merge conflict, both changes appear necessary and complementary:

1. The HEAD branch adds a test-specific helper `mount`
2. The other branch adds the Vue dependency needed for Vuex

Here's the resolved version with both imports preserved:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import { mount } from './support/helpers'
import Vuex, { mapState, mapMutations, mapGetters, mapActions, createNamespacedHelpers } from '../../src/index'

describe('Helpers', () => {
  it('mapState (array)', () => {
    const store = new Vuex.Store({
```

Reasoning:
- Vue import is required for Vuex functionality
- mount import appears to be a test utility needed for component mounting
- Both are independent imports serving different purposes
- Order doesn't affect functionality (Vue import first follows common convention)
- No duplication or logical conflicts exist between these imports
