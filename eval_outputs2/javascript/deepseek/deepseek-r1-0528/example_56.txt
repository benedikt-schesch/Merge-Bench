The conflict involves two main changes:
1. Different API calls for saving settings (`Settings.set` vs `set_settings`)
2. Commented vs active console logging

The intent appears to be:
- HEAD branch uses a namespaced API method and disables logging
- Other branch uses a flat API method and keeps logging active

Without additional context about which API is valid or whether logging should be enabled, this is ambiguous. The conflict markers should be preserved since we can't determine the correct version.

Here's the exact output preserving all formatting:

```javascript
        for (const $text of $texts) {
            $text.value = v;
            // Listen
            $text.addEventListener('input', async () => {
                const value = $text.value;
<<<<<<< HEAD
                await BG.exec('Settings.set', {id: k, value: value});
                // console.log(k, value);
=======
                await BG.exec('set_settings', {id: k, value: value});
                console.log(k, value);
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
            });
        }
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
