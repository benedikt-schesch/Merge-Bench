Based on the semantic analysis, both branches are trying to achieve the same goal of importing required modules and defining a path resolver function. The conflict arises from different variable declaration styles (`const` vs `var`). 

The resolution adopts modern ES6 `const` declarations since:
1. These variables are never reassigned
2. `const` provides better scoping and intentionality
3. The `'use strict'` directive should be preserved as it enables stricter parsing

Here's the resolved snippet with original spacing preserved:

```javascript
'use strict'
const path = require('path')
const utils = require('./utils')
const config = require('../config')
const vueLoaderConfig = require('./vue-loader.conf')

function resolve (dir) {
  return path.join(__dirname, '..', dir)
}
