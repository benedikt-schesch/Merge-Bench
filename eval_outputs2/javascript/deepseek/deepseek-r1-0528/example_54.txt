The merge conflict remains unresolved due to ambiguity in the intent behind the two conflicting versions. Both changes aim to persist a setting via `BG.exec()`, but it's unclear whether the correct method is `'Settings.set'` (HEAD) or `'set_settings'` (incoming branch). Since the semantics of `BG.exec()` and its API aren't verifiable from the context, the conflict is preserved for manual resolution.

```javascript

    function on_click(event) {
        // Save the selected element
        const $e = event.target;
        const selector = nopecha_selector.get_css($e);
<<<<<<< HEAD
        BG.exec('Settings.set', {id: nopecha_selector.locate, value: selector});
=======
        BG.exec('set_settings', {id: nopecha_selector.locate, value: selector});
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        stop(true);
    }

    function on_mousemove(event) {
        // Update highlight overlay when new element is targeted

```
