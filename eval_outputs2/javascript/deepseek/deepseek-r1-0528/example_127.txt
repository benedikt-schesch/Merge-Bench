Based on the semantic analysis of both branches' changes, here's the resolved version preserving both functionalities:

```javascript
var assert = require('assert');
var fs = require('fs');
var path = require('path');
var pkg = require('./../../../package.json');
var server, proxy;
var AxiosError = require('../../../lib/core/AxiosError');
var FormData = require('form-data');
var formidable = require('formidable');

describe('supports http with nodejs', function () {

  afterEach(function () {
    if (server) {
```

**Resolution rationale:**
1. Both branches add distinct module imports needed for different functionalities:
   - HEAD branch imports `AxiosError` for core error handling
   - Other branch imports `FormData` and `formidable` for form processing
2. The imports serve different purposes and don't conflict
3. All three imports are preserved in the order they appeared
4. Context lines remain unchanged to preserve test setup integrity
5. No ambiguity exists since both changes add new functionality rather than modifying existing code

The resolution maintains compatibility with both branches' requirements while preserving the test structure.
