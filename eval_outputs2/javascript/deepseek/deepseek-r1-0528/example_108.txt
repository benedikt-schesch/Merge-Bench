The merge conflict involves two changes to static properties of the `QianWenBot` class. Since both changes modify the same lines and represent conflicting intents (different file paths for logos and different login URLs), and there's no additional context to determine which change should take precedence, the conflict remains unresolved. 

Here is the preserved code with the conflict markers:

```javascript
}

export default class QianWenBot extends Bot {
  static _brandId = "qianWen"; // Brand id of the bot, should be unique. Used in i18n.
  static _className = "QianWenBot"; // Class name of the bot
<<<<<<< HEAD
  static _logoFilename = "qianwen-logo.png"; // Place it in public/bots/
  static _loginUrl = "https://tongyi.aliyun.com/";
=======
  static _logoFilename = "qianwen-logo.png"; // Place it in assets/bots/
  static _loginUrl = "https://qianwen.aliyun.com/";
>>>>>>> 7bf4a431d67458b38df2701bedf5041c817e1ff9
  static _lock = new AsyncLock(); // AsyncLock for prompt requests

  constructor() {
    super();
  }

```

**Reason for unresolved conflict:**  
1. `_logoFilename` comment conflicts on resource location (`public/bots/` vs `assets/bots/`)  
2. `_loginUrl` points to different endpoints (`tongyi.aliyun.com` vs `qianwen.aliyun.com`)  
3. Semantic intent differs (platform URL vs brand-specific URL)  
4. No context to determine correct resource path or authoritative endpoint  

Manual resolution is required to:  
- Verify correct logo storage path in the project  
- Confirm the current login URL for QianWen service  
- Align changes with project structure and external dependencies
