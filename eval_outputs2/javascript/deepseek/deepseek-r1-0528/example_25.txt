```javascript
    cache: LRU({
      max: 1000,
      maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 15
    }),
    // this is only needed when vue-server-renderer is npm-linked
    basedir: resolve('./dist'),
    directMode: true
  }))
}

let renderer

```

I've resolved the conflict by:
1. Keeping the `basedir` property from both branches
2. Adding the trailing comma after `basedir` (as required for multi-line object literals)
3. Including the new `directMode` property from the feature branch
4. Maintaining all surrounding context and spacing

The solution preserves both functional changes:
- The `basedir` configuration remains intact
- The new `directMode` flag is added as intended by the feature branch
- The syntax remains valid with proper comma separation between properties

The resolution follows JavaScript best practices where trailing commas in object literals are allowed and recommended for cleaner diffs. Both changes are additive and semantically compatible.
