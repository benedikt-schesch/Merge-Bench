The merge conflict involves a method name change and a strict equality operator modification. The comment above indicates the method creates a fake textarea element, which aligns with the `createFakeElement` name from HEAD. However, the other branch's method name `selectFake` suggests additional functionality that isn't visible in the snippet. Since the method's full intent is ambiguous without seeing the complete implementation, the conflict cannot be safely resolved.

Here's the original snippet with conflict markers preserved:

```javascript
    }
  }
  /**
   * Creates a fake textarea element, sets its value from `text` property,
   */
<<<<<<< HEAD
  createFakeElement() {
    const isRTL = document.documentElement.getAttribute('dir') == 'rtl';
=======
  selectFake() {
    const isRTL = document.documentElement.getAttribute('dir') === 'rtl';
>>>>>>> 17be1af63e685963991571ef5adbf988c087b3a3

    this.fakeElem = document.createElement('textarea');
    // Prevent zooming on iOS
    this.fakeElem.style.fontSize = '12pt';
    // Reset box model
```
