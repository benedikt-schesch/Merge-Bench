I'll help resolve this merge conflict while preserving the original context and intent. Here's the analysis:

1. The conflict is about a commented-out code block:
- HEAD branch (current changes) has removed this code entirely
- Other branch (a9ce98f) has added it as commented-out code

2. Semantic analysis:
- The commented code appears to be a debounced input handler implementation
- It's inactive (commented out) so it doesn't affect runtime behavior
- The HEAD branch likely removed it as dead code
- The other branch might have added it for reference/documentation

3. Resolution approach:
- Since the code is commented out in one branch and removed in the other
- The safest solution is to completely remove this code block
- This maintains the HEAD branch's active implementation
- Avoids adding dead code to the codebase

Here's the resolved version:

```javascript
    }
    else {
        document.querySelector('#export').classList.add('hidden');
    }

    /**
     * Tab switching
     */


```

Rationale:
- The commented code was removed in HEAD and is inactive in the other branch
- Keeping it would add unnecessary dead code
- The removal maintains the clean state from the HEAD branch
- The tab switching comment remains intact as it's separate functionality
