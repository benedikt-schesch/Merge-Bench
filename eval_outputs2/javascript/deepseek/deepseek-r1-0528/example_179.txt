Since the conflict involves two different dates for the same version comment block, and there's no additional context to determine which date is correct, I must preserve the conflict as ambiguous. Both sides are trying to declare the same version number but with different timestamps, and I can't infer which date is authoritative.

Here's the exact output preserving the original spacing and conflict markers:
