The merge conflict remains unresolved because the intent behind the function name change is ambiguous. Both `'Tab.info'` and `'info_tab'` appear to achieve the same semantic purpose (fetching a URL), but without additional context about the `BG.exec` API, it's unclear which is correct.

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript

    async function on_click(index) {
        const task = get_task();
        const image = get_image();
        if (task && image) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            const url = (await BG.exec('Tab.info'))?.url;
=======
            const url = (await BG.exec('info_tab'))?.url;
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
            const data = {task, image, index, url};

            if (SUBMISSION_STRATEGY.startsWith('l')) {
                window.parent.postMessage({nopecha: true, action: 'append', data: data}, '*');
            }

```

**Reasoning**:  
- Both branches attempt to fetch a URL for the `data` object  
- The conflict centers on the function naming convention (`'Tab.info'` vs `'info_tab'`), which could represent:  
  - A refactor (snake_case vs camelCase)  
  - Different API versions  
  - Divergent implementations in each branch  
- Without knowing which function exists in the `BG.exec` API, merging risks runtime errors  
- The surrounding context provides no clues about naming conventions or API changes  

**Recommendation**:  
Consult the author(s) of both branches to determine:  
1. Which function name is valid in the current API  
2. Whether this represents a deliberate rename or parallel development  
3. If tests exist that cover this functionality  

Alternatively, if both functions exist and are equivalent, choose the one matching the project's current naming conventions.
