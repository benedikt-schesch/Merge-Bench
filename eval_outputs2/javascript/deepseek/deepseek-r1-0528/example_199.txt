Based on the semantic analysis of both changes:

1. The Flow type annotation `: any` added to `console.error` appears to be a branch-specific change for type safety
2. The snapshot format change from `Array [` to `[` is a modernization of Jest's snapshot output
3. The core error message content remains identical in both versions

The resolution keeps the type annotation from the branch while maintaining the modern snapshot format:

```javascript
    :before {
      content: '\00d7';
    }
  `

  expect((console.error: any).mock.calls[0]).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    [
      "You have illegal escape sequence in your template literal, most likely inside content's property value.
    Because you write your CSS inside a JavaScript string you actually have to do double escaping, so for example "content: '\\00d7';" should become "content: '\\\\00d7';".

    ]
```

Key decisions:
1. Preserved the Flow type cast `: any` from the branch since it improves type safety
2. Kept the modern Jest snapshot format `[` instead of `Array [`
3. Maintained identical error message content and formatting
4. Retained all surrounding context without modification

This resolution combines the type safety improvement from the branch with the updated Jest snapshot format while preserving the original error message semantics.
