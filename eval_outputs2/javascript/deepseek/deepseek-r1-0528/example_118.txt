Here's the resolved snippet with the merge conflict fixed by combining both changes semantically. The function now includes the third parameter from the branch while preserving the event dispatch functionality from HEAD:

```javascript

		/*
		 *  element : canvas or video element
		 *  TODO: should be able to take img element as well
		 */
		this.track = function(element, box, gi) {

			var evt = document.createEvent("Event");
			evt.initEvent("clmtrackrBeforeTrack", true, true);
			document.dispatchEvent(evt)

			var scaling, translateX, translateY, rotation;
			var croppedPatches = [];
			var ptch, px, py;

```

Resolution reasoning:
1. The function signature now includes the third parameter `gi` from the branch
2. The event dispatch code from HEAD is preserved as it likely initializes tracking
3. The variable declarations are common to both versions
4. The changes are compatible since the event dispatch doesn't depend on the new parameter
5. Spacing and comments are preserved exactly as in the original context
