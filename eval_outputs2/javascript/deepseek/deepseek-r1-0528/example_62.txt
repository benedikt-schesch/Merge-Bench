Based on the semantic analysis, both sides share the same core intent of adding a subscription key declaration after the event handler. The only difference is whitespace formatting - HEAD adds an empty line for visual separation while the other branch doesn't. Since whitespace doesn't affect functionality and both versions are semantically valid, I'll preserve the empty line for better readability.

Resolved version:
```javascript
            $power_btn.classList.add('off');
        }
    });

    /**
     * Subscription key
     */

    const $key = document.querySelector('.settings_text[data-settings="key"]');
```
