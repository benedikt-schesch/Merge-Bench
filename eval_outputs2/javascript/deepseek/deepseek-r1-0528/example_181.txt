Since the conflict involves differing import paths (with and without `.js` file extensions) and the surrounding context doesn't provide enough information to determine project-specific module resolution preferences, the intent remains ambiguous. Both versions are syntactically valid but represent different configuration approaches. Without knowing the project's build setup or consistency patterns, the conflict should be preserved.
