I'll resolve this merge conflict by combining the best aspects of both changes. The intent is to test gradient handling for a zero-span domain, and both versions are functionally equivalent. I'll use the arrow function syntax from HEAD for conciseness and the `const` declaration from the other branch since the variable isn't reassigned.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
var tape = require('tape'),
    {scale} = require('vega-scale'),
    {scaleGradient} = require('../');

tape('scaleGradient handles zero-span domain', t => {
  const s = scale('linear')().range(['#f00', '#00f']);

  function testGradient(domain) {
    const g = scaleGradient.call({}, s.domain(domain), [0, 0], [1, 0], 3),
          n = g.stops.length - 1;
```

Key changes made:
1. Kept the arrow function `t =>` from HEAD for modern syntax
2. Used `const` from the other branch since `s` isn't reassigned
3. Preserved all original spacing and context
4. Maintained identical functionality from both branches

This resolution maintains the semantic intent of both changes while improving code quality. The arrow function provides concise syntax, and `const` ensures the scale reference remains constant.
