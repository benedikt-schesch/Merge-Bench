Here's the code snippet with the conflict preserved, as the intent is ambiguous regarding the `cachedPaddingH` initialization and additional cache properties:

```javascript
    // polling intensively.
    d.pollingFast = false;
    // Self-resetting timeout for the poller
    d.poll = new Delayed();

<<<<<<< HEAD
    d.cachedCharWidth = d.cachedTextHeight = null;
=======
    d.cachedCharWidth = d.cachedTextHeight = d.cachedPaddingH = null;
    d.measureLineCache = [];
    d.measureLineCachePos = 0;
>>>>>>> e1cfb7fd68e7988f508076063ebc17ddbabe2c92

    // Tracks when resetInput has punted to just putting a short
    // string into the textarea instead of the full selection.
    d.inaccurateSelection = false;
```

### Reasoning:
1. **HEAD branch** initializes only two cache properties (`cachedCharWidth`/`cachedTextHeight`) to `null`
2. **Other branch**:
   - Initializes three cache properties (adding `cachedPaddingH`)
   - Adds two new cache-related properties (`measureLineCache`/`measureLineCachePos`)
3. **Ambiguity**:
   - It's unclear if `cachedPaddingH` was intentionally removed in HEAD or added in the other branch
   - The new cache properties in the other branch might represent independent functionality changes
   - No context exists to determine if these changes are compatible
4. **Resolution**: Since we can't verify the semantic intent behind these conflicting changes, the merge conflict must be preserved for manual resolution.
