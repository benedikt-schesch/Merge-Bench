```javascript

            // break number and format
            int = value.toString().split('.')[0];
            precision = format.split('.')[1];
            thousands = format.indexOf(',');
            leadingCount = (format.split('.')[0].split(',')[0].match(/0/g) || []).length;

            if (precision) {
                if (numeral._.includes(precision, '[')) {
                    precision = precision.replace(']', '');
                    precision = precision.split('[');

```

The conflict is resolved by incorporating both changes:
1. The common lines before the conflict (`int`, `precision`, and `thousands` assignments) are preserved
2. The `leadingCount` assignment from the branch (bdbded5) is added after the `thousands` assignment
3. The subsequent `if (precision)` block remains unchanged

This maintains:
- The original HEAD's variable assignments
- The branch's new `leadingCount` calculation
- The following precision handling logic
- All spacing and context exactly as provided

The resolution adds the branch's functionality (counting leading zeros in the integer part format) without altering existing behavior.
