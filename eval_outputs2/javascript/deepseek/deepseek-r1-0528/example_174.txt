  it('should reder basic spacing', () => {
    const registry = new SheetsRegistry()
    const Div = styled('div')(space)
    const renderer = TestRenderer.create(
      <JssProvider registry={registry} generateId={createGenerateId()}>
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
- Both versions share identical test functionality and structure
- `.only` modifier is typically used for temporary test isolation during development
- Keeping it would unintentionally disable other tests in CI/production environments
- The HEAD version (without `.only`) represents the production-ready semantic
- No functional difference exists between the implementations beyond test scope
