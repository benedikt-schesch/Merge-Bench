The merge conflict occurs in the version number within the comment header. Both branches updated the version, but to different values. The semantic intent is to reflect the latest version number. Since beta.14 is higher than beta.10, it should be selected as the resolved version.

Here's the resolved code snippet:

```javascript
/*!
 * dist/inputmask
 * https://github.com/RobinHerbots/Inputmask
 * Copyright (c) 2010 - 2025 Robin Herbots
 * Licensed under the MIT license
 * Version: 5.0.10-beta.14
 */
!function(e, t) {
    if ("object" == typeof exports && "object" == typeof module) module.exports = t(); else if ("function" == typeof define && define.amd) define([], t); else {
        var n = t();
        for (var i in n) ("object" == typeof exports ? exports : e)[i] = n[i];
```

Key resolution points:
1. The conflict was limited to the version comment line
2. Both changes are version updates of the same format
3. Version 5.0.10-beta.14 supersedes 5.0.10-beta.10
4. The rest of the context remains unchanged as it's identical in both branches
5. Conflict markers are removed while preserving the comment structure

The resolution maintains semantic correctness by selecting the higher version number while preserving all other context exactly as provided.
