Based on analyzing the semantic intent of both changes, the conflict is resolved by adding the missing semicolon for consistency with surrounding code style. Here's the resolved snippet:

```javascript
					}

					// send event to signal that tracking was lost
					var evt = document.createEvent("Event");
					evt.initEvent("clmtrackrLost", true, true);
					document.dispatchEvent(evt);

					return false;
				}
			}
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. Both versions agree on the core functionality of dispatching the event
2. The surrounding context consistently uses semicolons (see `createEvent` and `initEvent` calls)
3. The added semicolon improves consistency without changing behavior
4. The version with semicolon comes from a more recent commit (fb17506) suggesting it might be a style correction

The resolution maintains the original context while fixing a minor style inconsistency.
