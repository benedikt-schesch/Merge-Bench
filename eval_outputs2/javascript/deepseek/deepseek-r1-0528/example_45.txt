The merge conflict in the provided code snippet cannot be resolved automatically due to ambiguity in the intent behind the conflicting changes. Both branches attempt to retrieve settings but use different methods (`Settings.get` vs `get_settings`). Without additional context about the `BG.exec` API or the codebase's conventions, it's unclear which approach is correct or if they're semantically equivalent.

Here's the original code with the conflict preserved:

```javascript

        if (task === null || cells === null || image_data === null) {
            return;
        }

<<<<<<< HEAD
        const settings = await BG.exec('Settings.get');
=======
        const settings = await BG.exec('get_settings');
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        if (!settings.enabled || !settings.funcaptcha_auto_solve) {
            return;
        }

        const solve_start = Time.time();

```

Key reasons for not resolving:
1. **Semantic Ambiguity**: The difference between `'Settings.get'` and `'get_settings'` could represent:
   - A refactored API (module pattern vs standalone function)
   - Different backend services
   - Version-specific implementations
2. **Lack of Context**: Without seeing the implementation of `BG.exec` or knowing the codebase's conventions, we can't determine which method is valid.
3. **Risk of Breakage**: Choosing incorrectly could result in runtime errors if the requested method doesn't exist.

Recommendations for manual resolution:
1. Check recent changes to the `BG.exec` service
2. Verify API documentation or method registrations
3. Consult commit messages from both branches
4. Test both versions if possible

The conflict should be resolved by a developer familiar with this part of the codebase who can determine which method is current and correct.
