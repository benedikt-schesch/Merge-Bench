            },
            {
                id: "windows95-boot",
                memory_size: 32 * 1024 * 1024,
                hda: {
                    "url": HOST + "w95.img",
                    "size": 242049024,
                    "async": true,
                    use_parts: !ON_LOCALHOST,
                },
                name: "Windows 95",
            },
```

**Resolution Reasoning:**
1. The configuration name `"Windows 95"` strongly indicates the branch version (`w95.img`) is semantically correct
2. The disk size `242049024` (242 MB) matches typical Windows 95 installations
3. The HEAD version (`freebsd3.img`) appears to be a different OS configuration that accidentally modified this entry
4. Both sides agree on the `async` and `use_parts` configuration

The resolution preserves the Windows 95-specific configuration while maintaining all other properties unchanged.
