Since the intent behind changing the interval value from 500ms to 200ms is ambiguous without additional context, I've preserved the conflict markers. Here's the exact snippet with the unresolved conflict:

```javascript
        return new_task.join('');
    }


    let last_urls_hash = null;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    function on_task_ready(i=500) {
=======
    function on_task_ready(i=200) {
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        return new Promise(resolve => {
            let checking = false;
            const check_interval = setInterval(async () => {
                if (checking) {
                    return;
```

**Reasoning:**  
Both branches modify the same parameter (`i`) in `on_task_ready()` but with different values (500ms vs 200ms). Without knowing:
1. Performance requirements
2. Why each value was chosen
3. How this interval affects surrounding logic  
it's impossible to determine the correct semantic resolution. The conflict requires human intervention to evaluate which interval better suits the application's timing requirements.
