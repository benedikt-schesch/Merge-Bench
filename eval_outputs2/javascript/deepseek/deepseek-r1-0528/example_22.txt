Here's the resolved snippet by combining both intents - fixing the typo while keeping the version update:

```javascript
'use strict'
// Template version: 1.1.1
// see http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack for documentation.

const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
```

**Resolution reasoning:**
1. `'use strict'` is the correct directive (fixes the typo from HEAD)
2. `1.1.1` is the more recent template version (from the incoming branch)
3. The rest of the context remains unchanged as it was identical in both branches

This resolution:
- Maintains JavaScript strict mode functionality
- Preserves the version upgrade
- Keeps all surrounding context intact
- Follows semantic versioning where 1.1.1 > 1.1.0
