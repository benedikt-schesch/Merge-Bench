An analysis of the conflict reveals two separate intents:

*   **HEAD:** Defines the `theme` prop as optional (`theme?: Theme`) within a standard object type (`{ ... }`).
*   **dae1bf2b...:** Defines the `theme` prop as required (`theme: Theme`) and uses a stricter Flow "exact" object type (`{| ... |}`), which prevents extra props from being passed.

The changes in the `dae1bf2b...` branch represent a move towards stricter and safer typing. Making the `theme` prop required for a component wrapped by a styling HOC (Higher-Order Component) is a robust pattern, as the HOC can be responsible for providing a default theme if one isn't available from a ThemeProvider. This simplifies the implementation of the wrapped component.

Therefore, the best resolution is to adopt the stricter and more explicit changes from the `dae1bf2b...` branch. This involves making the object type exact (`{| ... |}`) and the `theme` property required.

```javascript
  managers?: Managers,
  sheetOptions: StyleSheetOptions,
  disableStylesGeneration: boolean
|}

export type HOCProps<Theme, Props> = Props & {|
  theme: Theme,
  jssContext: Context,
  innerRef: any
|}

export type Classes = {[string]: string}

```
