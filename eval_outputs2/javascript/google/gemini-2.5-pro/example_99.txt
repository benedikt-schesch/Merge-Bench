An expert in semantic merge conflict resolution would recognize that one branch (`bdbded5...`) is introducing a configurable option (`scalePercentBy100`) to control the behavior of the `unformat` function. The other branch (`HEAD`) has a hardcoded behavior that is now one of the two possible behaviors in the configurable version.

The clear intent is to add flexibility. The new code in branch `bdbded5...` is a superset of the functionality in `HEAD`, where the `HEAD` behavior is achieved when `numeral.options.scalePercentBy100` is true. Therefore, the most logical resolution is to adopt the more flexible and configurable version.

```javascript
            }

            return output;
        },
        unformat: function(string) {
            var number = numeral._.stringToNumber(string);
            if (numeral.options.scalePercentBy100) {
                return number * 0.01;
            }
            return number;
        }
    });
})();
