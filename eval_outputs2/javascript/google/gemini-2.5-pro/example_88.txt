Resolving the conflict requires determining which import path for `createStateLink` is correct.

*   **HEAD:** `// import { createStateLink } from '../../modules/apollo-common';`
*   **Incoming Change (65e4b1a553...):** `// import { createStateLink } from '../../modules/apollo-common/links/state.js';`

Both changes keep the import commented out, indicating that the `createStateLink` functionality is not currently in use. The difference is the path. The incoming change provides a more specific path, pointing directly to `links/state.js`. This is a common pattern when code is refactored into a more organized directory structure. The incoming change is likely updating the commented-out line to reflect this new location.

Therefore, the most logical resolution is to accept the more specific and updated path from the incoming change while keeping the line commented, as it is in both branches.
