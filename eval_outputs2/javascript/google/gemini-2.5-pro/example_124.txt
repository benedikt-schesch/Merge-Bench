An analysis of both branches indicates that the `d8d43c1...` branch is a clear improvement and refactoring over the `HEAD` branch.

**Intent of `HEAD`:**
- It attempts to handle an aborted request by rejecting early.
- However, its implementation is likely buggy as `reject(err)` does not stop execution, leading to a second `reject(enhanceError(...))` call, which would be a no-op but indicates flawed logic.
- It uses a magic string `'ERR_FR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS'` for the error code.

**Intent of `d8d43c1...`:**
- It also handles aborted requests, but it uses `return` to exit the handler. This is a common pattern to prevent multiple event handlers from rejecting the same promise, which can happen when a request is aborted.
- It uses `AxiosError.from(...)`, which appears to be a newer, cleaner factory method for creating errors compared to `enhanceError`.
- It uses the constant `AxiosError.ERR_FR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` instead of a magic string, which is better practice for maintainability and type safety.

The changes in `d8d43c1...` represent a more robust and modern implementation of the same error-handling logic. Therefore, adopting this version is the correct resolution.

```javascript
      }
    });

    // Handle errors
    req.on('error', function handleRequestError(err) {
      if (req.aborted && err.code !== AxiosError.ERR_FR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS) return;
      reject(AxiosError.from(err, null, config, req));
    });

    // set tcp keep alive to prevent drop connection by peer
    req.on('socket', function handleRequestSocket(socket) {
      // default interval of sending ack packet is 1 minute

```
