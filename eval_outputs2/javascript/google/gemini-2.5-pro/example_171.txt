The intent of the `HEAD` branch is to export the `default` from `./withStyles` and to introduce a new `styled` component export.

The intent of the other branch (`dae1bf2b...`) is to provide a named export `{withStyles}` in addition to the default export for backward compatibility.

A semantic merge combines these intents. The `default` export from `./withStyles` should be exported as both the `default` for the library and as a named export `withStyles`. Additionally, the new `styled` export from the `HEAD` branch should be included.

```javascript
export {default as createUseStyles} from './createUseStyles'
export {default as JssProvider} from './JssProvider'
export {default as jss} from './jss'
export {SheetsRegistry, createGenerateId} from 'jss'
export {default as JssContext} from './JssContext'
export {default, default as withStyles} from './withStyles'
export {default as styled} from './styled'

```
