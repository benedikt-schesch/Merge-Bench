The conflict here is stylistic, concerning the termination of a function block. The `HEAD` branch ends the block with a simple curly brace `}`, which is valid for a function declaration. The incoming branch ends it with `};`, which is common and often recommended for function expressions (e.g., when assigning a function to a variable or a property on an object).

The use of `};` is a more defensive and explicit way to terminate the statement, preventing potential issues with Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI). Given that one side explicitly added the semicolon, it's highly likely this code block is a function expression. Therefore, adopting the version with the semicolon is the safer and more semantically appropriate resolution.

```javascript
            break;
    }

    //consistency checks if there are problems with the filesystem
    //this.fs.Check();
};

```
