This merge conflict represents a refactoring of the background script's API. Both sides of the conflict are attempting to perform the exact same action: calling a background function via `BG.exec` to save a CSS selector as a setting.

The only difference is the name of the function being called:
-   `HEAD` uses `'Settings.set'`.
-   The other branch uses `'set_settings'`.

The name `'Settings.set'` suggests a more organized, modular API (a `set` method within a `Settings` module), which is a common direction for refactoring. It's highly probable that `'set_settings'` was the old name, and it has been refactored to `'Settings.set'`. Therefore, adopting the `HEAD` version is the most logical resolution.

```javascript

    function on_click(event) {
        // Save the selected element
        const $e = event.target;
        const selector = nopecha_selector.get_css($e);
        BG.exec('Settings.set', {id: nopecha_selector.locate, value: selector});
        stop(true);
    }

    function on_mousemove(event) {
        // Update highlight overlay when new element is targeted

```
