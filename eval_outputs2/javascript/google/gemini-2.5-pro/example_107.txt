The intent of the `HEAD` side is to update the `Function` constructor to use the `at` method and to add a new constructor for `Object` using the `entries` method. The other side updates the `Function` constructor to use the `flat` method.

The addition of the `'Object'` constructor in `HEAD` is a new feature that should be preserved. The `at` method for arrays is a more recent addition to JavaScript (ES2022) than the `flat` method (ES2019). Given this, and the simultaneous addition of the `Object` constructor, it's most likely that `HEAD` represents a more up-to-date version of the code.

The most logical resolution is to accept all changes from `HEAD`, as it incorporates the `Function` update while also adding the new `Object` constructor.

```javascript
  const CONSTRUCTORS = {
    'Array':    '[]',
    'Number':   '(+[])',
    'String':   '([]+[])',
    'Boolean':  '(![])',
    'Function': '[]["at"]',
    'RegExp':   'Function("return/"+false+"/")()',
    'Object':	'[]["entries"]()'
  };

  const MAPPING = {
    'a':   '(false+"")[1]',
    'b':   '([]["entries"]()+"")[2]',

```
