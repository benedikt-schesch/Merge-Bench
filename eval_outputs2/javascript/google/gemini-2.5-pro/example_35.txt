Resolving this merge conflict requires understanding the intent behind the imports on each side.

*   **HEAD**: This side is importing `nextTick` and `mount`. `import { nextTick } from 'vue'` is the standard for Vue 3. The `mount` helper suggests component-level testing is being set up. The import path for Vuex (`../../src/index`) is a relative path to the local source code. The overall intent appears to be an update of the test suite to a modern, Vue 3-compatible setup.
*   **ce0c88a81703017cad63e4b5a913eff6349f585a**: This side is importing the default `Vue` object, which is characteristic of a Vue 2 setup (e.g., for `Vue.use(Vuex)`). It also imports Vuex using a path alias (`@/index`), which is generally a cleaner, more maintainable approach than a relative path as it is not dependent on the test file's location.

The core of the conflict is a difference in the targeted Vue version. The most forward-looking resolution is to adopt the modern setup from `HEAD` while also incorporating the cleaner path alias from the other branch. This assumes the project is moving towards Vue 3, making the `import Vue from 'vue'` import obsolete for this test file, as the test utilities would handle app creation and plugin installation.

The merged code combines the modern testing utilities from `HEAD` with the improved import path from the other branch.

```javascript
import { nextTick } from 'vue'
import { mount } from './support/helpers'
import Vuex from '@/index'

const TEST = 'TEST'
const isSSR = process.env.VUE_ENV === 'server'

describe('Store', () => {
