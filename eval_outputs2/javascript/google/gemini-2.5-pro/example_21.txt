The provided snippet contains two conflict markers. The first conflict is a simple addition of an import statement on one branch, which is straightforward to resolve by including the new import. However, the second conflict marker (`<<<<<<< HEAD`) is incomplete and truncated. Without the full context of the second conflict, it's impossible to determine the overall intent of the changes. The resolution of the second conflict could potentially affect whether the new import from the first conflict is needed.

Given this ambiguity and the incomplete nature of the snippet, the safest and most correct action is to return the conflict unresolved.

```javascript
