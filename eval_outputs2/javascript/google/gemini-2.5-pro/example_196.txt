Both sides of the conflict are asserting that no console errors or warnings were logged during the test. The `HEAD` branch uses the inline snapshot `Array []`, while the incoming branch uses `[]` and also casts `console.error` and `console.warn` to `any` to satisfy a type-checker (likely Flow or TypeScript) which wouldn't otherwise know about the `.mock` property added by the test runner.

The intent is identical. The version with the `any` cast is slightly more robust in a typed environment, and the snapshot format difference is cosmetic. We will adopt the version with the type cast.

```javascript
    render(<StyledDivWithId />, {
      hydrate: true,
      container: safeQuerySelector('#root')
    })

    expect((console.error: any).mock.calls).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`[]`)
    expect((console.warn: any).mock.calls).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`[]`)
  })

  test('no hydration mismatch for css prop when using useId', async () => {
    const finalHTML = await disableBrowserEnvTemporarily(() => {
      resetAllModules()

```
