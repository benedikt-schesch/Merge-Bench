Both sides of this merge conflict aim to achieve the same goal: create a shell script for a git hook that sources a helper script named `h` located in the same directory. The conflict lies in the method used to determine the script's own directory.

-   **HEAD (`"${0%/*}"`)**: This version uses POSIX shell parameter expansion. It's a built-in shell feature that is efficient but can have edge cases if the script path (`$0`) does not contain a `/`.
-   **The other branch (`"$(dirname "$0")"`)**: This version uses the `dirname` command. It is generally considered more robust and readable, especially for handling various path formats, which is why it's often preferred for portability in projects like husky.

The `dirname` approach is a more robust and explicit solution to find the script's directory. It is the better semantic choice for ensuring the hooks work correctly in different environments and configurations (e.g., when git's `core.hooksPath` is set to a subdirectory). Therefore, we will adopt the `dirname` version.

```javascript
	})

	f.mkdirSync(_(), { recursive: true })
	w(_('.gitignore'), '*')
	f.copyFileSync(new URL('husky', import.meta.url), _('h'))
	l.forEach(h => w(_(h), `#!/usr/bin/env sh\n. "\$(dirname "\$0")/h"`, { mode: 0o755 }))
	return ''
}
```
