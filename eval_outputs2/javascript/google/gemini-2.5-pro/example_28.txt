This merge conflict involves two different variable names for what appears to be the same caching object: `pageCache` and `microCache`.

*   **HEAD's Intent (`pageCache`)**: This side uses a generic term for a cache that stores rendered pages.
*   **Incoming Change's Intent (`microCache`)**: This side uses a more specific term, "microcaching," which typically refers to caching dynamic content for a very short period (e.g., 1-5 seconds) to handle traffic spikes.

**Resolution:**

Both variables are used in the same wayâ€”to retrieve a cached item using `req.url` as the key. The conflict is purely about the name of the cache instance. In the context of server-side rendering performance optimizations, "microcaching" is a common and specific pattern. Using the name `microCache` is more descriptive and clearly communicates the caching strategy (short-lived) to future developers, whereas `pageCache` is more ambiguous about the cache's Time To Live (TTL).

Assuming the intent is to implement this common short-lived caching pattern, adopting the more specific `microCache` name is the best path forward for code clarity and maintainability.

```javascript
    }
  }

  const cacheable = isCacheable(req)
  if (cacheable) {
    const hit = microCache.get(req.url)
    if (hit) {
      if (!isProd) {
        console.log(`cache hit!`)
      }
      return res.end(hit)

```
