The merge conflict is a simple stylistic one.

*   **`HEAD`'s Intent:** To add a blank line after the event listener's closing bracket `});` to visually separate it from the subsequent code block. This is a common practice to improve code readability.
*   **`a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24`'s Intent:** To have no blank line between the two code blocks.

The semantic resolution is to combine these intents by accepting the change from `HEAD`. Adding a blank line between distinct logical blocks of code is a standard convention that makes the code easier to read and maintain. The intent to improve readability is semantically stronger than the alternative.

The `>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24` at the beginning of the snippet appears to be a leftover artifact from a previous merge or a copy-paste error and has been removed in the resolution.

```javascript
            $power_btn.classList.add('off');
        }
    });


    /**
     * Subscription key

    const $key = document.querySelector('.settings_text[data-settings="key"]');
