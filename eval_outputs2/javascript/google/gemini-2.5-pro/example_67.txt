The semantic intent of the two branches is to change the default interval for a polling function. The `HEAD` branch sets the default to `500ms` while the incoming branch (`a9ce98f9...`) sets it to `200ms`.

Without further context on whether a faster or slower polling interval is desired, it's impossible to determine the correct value. One change might be for performance tuning (slower poll) while the other might be for responsiveness (faster poll). As the correct intent is ambiguous, the conflict is best left for the developer to resolve.

```javascript
        return task;
    }


    let last_urls_hash = null;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    function on_task_ready(i=500) {
=======
    function on_task_ready(i=200) {
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        return new Promise(resolve => {
            let checking = false;
            const check_interval = setInterval(async () => {
                if (checking) {
                    return;

```
