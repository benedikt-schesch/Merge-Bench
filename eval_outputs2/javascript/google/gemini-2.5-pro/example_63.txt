An analysis of the conflict reveals that one side of the merge introduces a new, but commented-out, block of code. This code appears to be related to adding a delayed event listener to an input field with the ID `#key`. Since the code is commented out, it has no functional impact on the application. The other side of the merge has no changes in this section.

The most logical resolution is to accept the new, commented-out code. The developer likely added it as a placeholder for a future feature or as an experimental piece of work that was temporarily disabled. Keeping it preserves this intent without altering the program's behavior.

```javascript
    }
    else {
        document.querySelector('#export').classList.add('hidden');
    }

    // let change_delay_timer = null;
    // document.querySelector('#key').addEventListener('input', () => {
    //     clearTimeout(change_delay_timer);
    //     change_delay_timer = setTimeout(check_plan, 500);
    // });

    /**
     * Tab switching
