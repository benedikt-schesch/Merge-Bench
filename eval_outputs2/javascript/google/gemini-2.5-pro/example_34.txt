This is a classic conflict from migrating a library (likely Vuex) from an older version (compatible with Vue 2) to a newer version (compatible with Vue 3).

*   **The `HEAD` side:** `watch(() => store._state.data, ...)` uses the `watch` function from the Vue 3 Composition API. In modern Vuex, the state is made reactive using Vue 3's reactivity system, and `store._state.data` holds the reactive state object.
*   **The `ce0c...` side:** `store._vm.$watch(function () { return this._data.$$state }, ...)` uses the instance `$watch` method from Vue 2. Older versions of Vuex used a hidden Vue 2 instance (`_vm`) to make the state reactive, and the state was stored in `_vm._data.$$state`.

The semantic intent of both is identical: watch the store's state to enforce strict mode. The `HEAD` version is the modern, correct implementation for a Vue 3 environment. Therefore, we should keep the `HEAD` version.

```javascript
    )
  }
}

function enableStrictMode (store) {
  watch(() => store._state.data, () => {
    if (__DEV__) {
      assert(store._committing, `do not mutate vuex store state outside mutation handlers.`)
    }
  }, { deep: true, flush: 'sync' })
}

```
