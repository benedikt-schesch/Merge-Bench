This merge conflict arises from two different default values being set for the polling interval in the `on_task_ready` function.

*   **HEAD** sets the default interval `i` to `500` milliseconds.
*   The **incoming change** sets the default interval `i` to `200` milliseconds.

Both sides intend to make the function poll for a task's readiness, but they disagree on the optimal default frequency. A lower value (200ms) means faster, more responsive checks at the cost of higher resource usage (CPU/network). A higher value (500ms) is more conservative, reducing load but potentially feeling less responsive.

Without more context on the specific performance requirements or the nature of the task being checked, a choice must be made. A higher, more conservative default value is often a safer choice as it is less likely to cause unintended performance issues across the application. Developers who need a more responsive check in specific instances can still override the default by passing a smaller value (e.g., `on_task_ready(200)`).

Therefore, I will resolve the conflict by using the more conservative `500ms` from `HEAD` as the default.

```javascript
        return new_task.join('');
    }


    let last_urls_hash = null;
    function on_task_ready(i=500) {
        return new Promise(resolve => {
            let checking = false;
            const check_interval = setInterval(async () => {
                if (checking) {
                    return;

```
