Based on the surrounding context, the code appears to be configuring a captcha challenge. The variable `nframes` is set to `18`, which likely represents the total number of images or buttons in the challenge grid.

*   The `HEAD` side sets `MAX_BTNS_PER_ROW` to `9`. With 18 total frames, this would create a balanced grid of 2 rows with 9 buttons each (2x9).
*   The other side sets `MAX_BTNS_PER_ROW` to `7`. With 18 total frames, this would result in an uneven layout, such as two rows of 7 and a third row of 4.

The semantic intent is likely to create a well-structured visual grid for the user. A 2x9 grid is more symmetrical and standard for such challenges than a jagged layout. Therefore, `9` is the more logical value to pair with `nframes = 18`. The resolution will be to keep `MAX_BTNS_PER_ROW = 9`.

```javascript
    };
    const SRCS = {
        'outlook': ['https://iframe.arkoselabs.com/B7D8911C-5CC8-A9A3-35B0-554ACEE604DA/index.html?mkt=en', false],  // Pick the penguin
        'outlook auth': ['https://iframe-auth.arkoselabs.com/B7D8911C-5CC8-A9A3-35B0-554ACEE604DA/index.html?mkt=en', false],  // Pick one square that shows two identical objects.
    };
    const MAX_BTNS_PER_ROW = 9;

    let nframes = 18;


    reset();

```
