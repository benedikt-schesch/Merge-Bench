Both branches are attempting to add a new `getMaxY` convenience function. The incoming branch (`c973213a...`) also includes a helpful comment that explains the reason for this new function, referencing a previous buggy implementation. The merge tool has failed and duplicated the function definition.

The correct semantic resolution is to combine the intents: include the new `getMaxY` function that both branches want, and also include the explanatory comment from the incoming branch, which adds valuable context. The duplicated code caused by the faulty merge should be removed.

```javascript

//iteratee for lodash _.max
    function getMax(v, i){
      return parseFloat(v);
    }

//for some reason this loop does not properly get the maxY if there are multiple datasets (was doing 4 datasets that differred wildly)
//just used lodash _.max utility
    function getMaxY() {
      if (self.options.maxY) {
        return self.options.maxY;
      }
      
```
