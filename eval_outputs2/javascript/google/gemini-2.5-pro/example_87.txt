The semantic intent of both branches is to import `ApolloClient` and `InMemoryCache` from the Apollo Client library. The `HEAD` branch imports them from two separate locations, while the other branch consolidates them into a single import statement, which is the more common and modern convention for Apollo Client v3. The consolidated import is cleaner and functionally identical, so it is the preferred resolution.

```javascript
 * (necessary for SSR)
 *
 * /!\ It must be recreated on every request
 */

import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

import { SchemaLink } from '@apollo/client/link/schema';
import { GraphQLSchema } from '../graphql/index.js';
