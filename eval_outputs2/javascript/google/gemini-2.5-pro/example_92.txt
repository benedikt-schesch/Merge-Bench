This is a conflict in an auto-generated asset manifest file, likely from a tool like Webpack. Both `HEAD` and the incoming branch have produced new builds, resulting in different content hashes for the `index.js` and `index.css` assets.

Manually choosing one version over the other would discard the underlying source code changes from the other branch, leading to an inconsistent state. The correct way to resolve this is to merge the actual source code files, resolve any conflicts there, and then run the build process again. This will generate a new, correct manifest file.

Since this process cannot be done automatically without access to the source code and build system, the conflict is returned unresolved to indicate that a manual re-build is required.
