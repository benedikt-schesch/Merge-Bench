Resolving this merge conflict requires understanding the intent behind both changes.

*   **HEAD (`<<<`):** This side attempts to use `setTimeout` to delay the execution of `wx.canvasToTempFilePath`. However, it incorrectly passes the `setTimeout` call itself as the callback to `ctx.draw`. `setTimeout` returns a timer ID (a number), not a function, which is not a valid callback for `ctx.draw`. The clear *intent* was to add a 100ms delay to fix a potential race condition where the canvas isn't ready when `canvasToTempFilePath` is called.

*   **REMOTE (`>>>`):** This side correctly uses a callback function with `ctx.draw`. The function `wx.canvasToTempFilePath` is called immediately after the `draw` operation completes, which is the standard and correct usage of the API.

A semantic resolution combines the correct implementation from the **REMOTE** side with the intended behavior (the delay) from the **HEAD** side. The `setTimeout` should be placed *inside* the valid `ctx.draw` callback. This respects both intents: execute code after the draw is complete, and add a specific delay before saving the canvas to a file.

```javascript

    canvasToTempFilePath(opt) {
      if (!opt.canvasId) {
        opt.canvasId = this.data.canvasId;
      }

      ctx.draw(true, () => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          wx.canvasToTempFilePath(opt, this);
        }, 100);
      });
    },

    touchStart(e) {
