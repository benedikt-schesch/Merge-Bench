The merge conflict presents one branch introducing a function for handling hidden SSID changes (`onHiddenSSIDChange`) while the other branch does not have this function at all in the same location. The existing functions (`onPortraitChange`, `onHidePasswordChange`) follow a consistent pattern of updating a single property in the settings object. 

However, without additional context such as:
- What the other branch intends to do with this section of code,
- Or clarification on whether `onHiddenSSIDChange` is critical functionality,

â€¦the semantic intent of either change cannot be definitively evaluated. Thus, it is not possible to determine whether the function should be retained or removed based on available information.

Per the user's instructions, if the intent is ambiguous, the original conflicting code should be returned **unchanged**, preserving the spacing and context.
