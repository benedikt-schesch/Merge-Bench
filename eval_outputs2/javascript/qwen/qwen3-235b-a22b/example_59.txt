The provided merge conflict presents two distinct implementations requesting settings data, `BG.exec('Settings.get')` (HEAD) and `BG.exec('get_settings')`, with insufficient context to determine which call aligns functionally with the intent of the code. Neither line can be semantically validated as definitively correct without additional knowledge about the runtime environment, API interface, or intended configuration.

```javascript
    rendering_server_plan = false;
}


async function init_ui() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const settings = await BG.exec('Settings.get');
    console.log('settings', settings);

=======
    const settings = await BG.exec('get_settings');
