The code conflict arises due to modification of the same line (`blurImg.className`) with fundamentally different intents: one (`HEAD`) leverages configuration for consistency and extensibility, while the other (`7bd825c55d96b02d18d55931af1afdfe323155fb`) hardcodes the class name, possibly to enforce guaranteed behavior when configuration fails or is not initialized properly. Additionally, the second version introduces a new behavior (`blurImg.cssText = img.cssText`), which seems semantically aligned with maintaining visual fidelity between the newly created blur image and the original image during loading transitions.

However, upon closer inspection, both sides of the conflict have overlapping functional goals:

- The configuration-based class (`lazySizes.cfg.blurUpClass`) indicates a preference for extensibility and customization (perhaps allowing environment or theme-based styling).
- The hardcoded class (`ls-blur-up-img`) indicates a desire for deterministic rendering (to guarantee default or expected styling is applied).

Given the abstraction with `lazySizes.cfg.blurUpClass`, we infer the presence of a system relying on external configurationâ€”potentially defaulting to `ls-blur-up-img` in most contexts. The hardcoded change may be either a safeguard or a bug fix, making the intent ambiguous without broader visibility into config handling and architecture precedent.

The addition of the `cssText` line introduces behavior not found in `HEAD`, specifically to propagate intrinsic layout and display styles to the blur-up image. This aids in preserving visual consistency and preventing layout shifts during loading, making it significant and semantically beneficial.

Due to these overlapping but non-obvious divergences in intent, especially in the treatment of the `className`, but also the necessity of maintaining the `cssText` in the modified branch, **this conflict cannot be fully resolved without further context or alignment between developers.**

Thus, the conflict remains unresolved, as follows:

```javascript
			blurImg = document.createElement('img');

			blurImg.addEventListener('load', onloadBlurUp);
			blurImg.addEventListener('error', onloadBlurUp);

<<<<<<< HEAD
			blurImg.className = lazySizes.cfg.blurUpClass;
=======
			blurImg.className = 'ls-blur-up-img';
			blurImg.cssText = img.cssText;
>>>>>>> 7bd825c55d96b02d18d55931af1afdfe323155fb
			blurImg.src = src;
			blurImg.alt = '';
			blurImg.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'true');

			parent.insertBefore(blurImg, (picture || img).nextSibling);
```
