The code conflict occurs between two branches where one (`HEAD`) insert nothing and the other (`a9ce98f9...`) inserts the "Subscription key" logic. The intent behind the merge appears to be preserving the API subscription key setup introduced in the `a9ce98f9` branch, as `HEAD` contains no competing logic. Therefore, the regional conflict is resolved by accepting the added meaningful logic.

Here's the fully resolved snippet preserving the full context and original spacing as requested:

```javascript
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
            $power_btn.classList.add('off');
        }
    });

    /**
     * Subscription key
     */

    const $key = document.querySelector('.settings_text[data-settings="key"]');

    /**
     * Subscription key
     */

    const $key = document.querySelector('.settings_text[data-settings="key"]');
```

âœ… **Resolution rationale:**  
- The conflict occurred in an empty region from `HEAD`, while the other branch added a meaningful block.
- Choosing the added section preserves intent and adds missing functionality.
- Context and spacing remain untouched as per the request.
