No reasoning found</think>
The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict where two different branches have attempted to modify the same section of code by activating different `open_frame_token` callsâ€”`'imvu'` in `HEAD` and `'twitter'` in the other branch. These changes are semantically distinct and not obviously compatible; each side seems to be making a single specific call active.

Given this ambiguity in intent, and lacking additional context about when or why these specific `frame_token` calls should or should not be used together, it is inappropriate to assume that both should be active or that one should override the other without explicit reasoning.

Therefore, since the intent is unclear, and according to instructions, the conflict should not be modified and should be returned as-is.

```javascript


    reset();
    // open_all();
    // open_frame_token('ea signup', 0, nframes);
<<<<<<< HEAD
    // open_frame_token('twitter', 0, nframes);
    open_frame_token('imvu', 0, nframes);
=======
    open_frame_token('twitter', 0, nframes);

    function reset() {
        document.body.innerHTML = '';
