The merge conflict in the header comment primarily revolves around conflicting version and release date information within a license block. This section does not appear to affect functionality, but rather serves as metadata for attribution, licensing, and versioning purposes. Both sides of the conflict are syntactically valid and semantically identical beyond the version and date.

---

When analyzing the intent, the key differences are:
- `VERSION: 1.6.3` (HEAD)
- `DATE: 2019-09-13` (HEAD)
- `VERSION: 1.6.1` (other branch)
- `DATE: 2019-09-05` (other branch)

There are no other changes in the context that would suggest a functional modification or a specific semantic adjustment that favors one version over the other. The license, URL, and surrounding documentation remain consistent in both versions.

Without additional context — such as release strategy, branch workflows, or team conventions — determining which version should be used is ambiguous. Merging without this clarity could introduce an incorrect version, which might misrepresent the current or intended release.

As per the provided instructions, if the intent or resolution is unclear, the recommendation is to preserve the conflict markers and return the snippet unchanged.

Here is the original code with the conflict intact:
