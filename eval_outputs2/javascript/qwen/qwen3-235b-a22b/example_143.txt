The code snippet presents a merge conflict between two changes aiming to handle cache invalidation during a resize event. Both versions attempt to clear size caches and trigger resize logic, but they differ in the set of variables to clear and the functions to call afterward.

### Conflict Analysis

1. **Conflict Part 1 (Variable Nullification)**:
   - `HEAD` clears:  
     ```js
     d.cachedCharWidth = d.cachedTextHeight = knownScrollbarWidth = null;
     ```
   - Commit `e1cfb7f` extends this to:  
     ```js
     d.cachedCharWidth = d.cachedTextHeight = d.cachedPaddingH = knownScrollbarWidth = null;
     ```
   - This indicates that `d.cachedPaddingH` was added later, likely for a new feature or more granular control during layout recalculations.
   - **Resolution Intention**: It is semantically logical to include all variables that can be invalidated during a resize, especially if they are related to layout or dimension caching.

2. **Conflict Part 2 (Post-Clear Logic)**:
   - `HEAD` calls:  
     ```js
     cm.setSize();
     ```
   - Commit `e1cfb7f` introduces:
     ```js
     clearCaches(cm);
     runInOp(cm, bind(regChange, cm));
     ```
   - These suggest further abstraction of resize handling, possibly for performance, concurrency, or separation of layout recalculations from redraws.
   - **Critical Ambiguity**: It is not clear whether `cm.setSize()` is intended to be replaced by the other functions, or if it should complement them.

### Final Resolution Decision

Given that the top-level intent—invalidating the layout/size cache and initiating the editor layout update—is shared between both sides, and **assuming that no prior knowledge of code dependencies indicates incompatibility**, it is reasonable to preserve **all cache invalidations** and finalize it with a combination of both sets of function calls.

Thus, the resolution will:
- Combine all four cached variable resets.
- Include all function calls from both versions.

However, if `clearCaches()` and `runInOp()` collectively subsume `cm.setSize()`'s behavior, then calling all three might be **redundant** or **unnecessary**. Without such clarification, failing to include any might cause breakage—particularly in the logic tracked by commit `e1cfb7fd68e7988f508076063ebc17ddbabe2c92`.

Hence, we merge both changes **semantically**, resolving the conflict defensively.

### Resolved Snippet

```javascript
    var resizeTimer;
    function onResize() {
      if (resizeTimer == null) resizeTimer = setTimeout(function() {
        resizeTimer = null;
        // Might be a text scaling operation, clear size caches.
        d.cachedCharWidth = d.cachedTextHeight = d.cachedPaddingH = knownScrollbarWidth = null;
        cm.setSize();
        clearCaches(cm);
        runInOp(cm, bind(regChange, cm));
      }, 100);
    }
    on(window, "resize", onResize);
    // The above handler holds on to the editor and its data
    // structures. Here we poll to unregister it when the editor is no
```

> ✅ **Conflict Resolved**: Combined intent includes all layout cache invalidations and retains both API use patterns—`setSize` and custom operations—since their purposes and dependencies are ambiguous a priori.
