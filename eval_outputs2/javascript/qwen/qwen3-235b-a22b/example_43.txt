The code snippet contains a merge conflict within the parameters of the `on_task_ready` function. The conflict is due to both branches defining different default values for the `i` parameter—500 in `HEAD`, and 200 in the other branch (`a9ce98f97`). This difference affects how frequently a `setInterval` will fire, which could influence the responsiveness or performance of a periodic check, likely related to image readiness.

The surrounding code:

- Refers to image data (`$image?.src`, `last_image_data`).
- Involves a promise that polls (`check_interval`) until a certain condition (`checking`) is met.

The function implementation is identical on both sides of the merge, and only the **default interval time differs**, indicating conflicting assumptions about the optimal check frequency. However, as the merge conflict resolution prompt instructs us to think in terms of **intent and semantics**, we need to evaluate whether there is a clear winner based on the intended behavior.

### Intent and Semantics Consideration

- `i=500` implies less frequent polling, which is more resource-efficient.
- `i=200` implies more frequent polling, which might be used for faster detection of readiness at the expense of higher resource consumption.

Since both the implementation and the higher-level logic are the same, and no context is given about the environment (e.g., web worker, UI thread), constraints, or performance goals, it’s **ambiguous** which default (`200` or `500`) better aligns with the intended behavior.

### Merge Conflict Resolution Outcome

Given the instructions, and that the intent is **not clear enough to confidently resolve the conflict**, the **correct approach** is to **preserve the original merge conflict markers** without resolving.

Here is the code snippet in the requested format:

```javascript
        return $image?.src?.split(';base64,')[1];
    }


    let last_image_data = null;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    function on_task_ready(i=500) {
=======
    function on_task_ready(i=200) {
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        return new Promise(resolve => {
            let checking = false;
            const check_interval = setInterval(async () => {
                if (checking) {
                    return;
```
