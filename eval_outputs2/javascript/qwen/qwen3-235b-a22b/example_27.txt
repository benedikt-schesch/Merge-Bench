The semantic intent of the code is to ensure that all pages in this application are micro-cacheable due to the absence of user-specific content.

The conflict primarily arises between two implementations:

1. `const isCacheable = req => true` — a direct adherence to the surrounding comment that states every page is cacheable.
2. `const isCacheable = req => useMicroCache` — which implies there may be dynamic control over caching, though the comment does not reflect such logic.

Given the clarity of the comment—"since this app has no user-specific content, every page is micro-cacheable"—the function's intent is to always mark pages as cacheable.

Therefore, if the application is deliberate in its design to universally support micro-caching, the version that returns `true` unconditionally is semantically correct.

Resolved code:
```javascript

// since this app has no user-specific content, every page is micro-cacheable.
// if your app involves user-specific content, you need to implement custom
// logic to determine whether a request is cacheable based on its url and
// headers.
const isCacheable = req => true

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  if (!renderer) {
    return res.end('waiting for compilation... refresh in a moment.')
  }

```
