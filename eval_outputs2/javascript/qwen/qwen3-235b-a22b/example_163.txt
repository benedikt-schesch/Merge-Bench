Here's the resolved code snippet preserving the full context and semantics from both branches:

```javascript
    settings.vga_memory_size = options["vga_memory_size"] || 8 * 1024 * 1024;
    settings.boot_order = options["boot_order"] || 0x213;
    settings.fastboot = options["fastboot"] || false;
    settings.fda = undefined;
    settings.fdb = undefined;
    settings.uart1 = options["uart1"] || false;
    settings.uart2 = options["uart2"] || false;
    settings.uart3 = options["uart3"] || false;
    settings.cmdline = options["cmdline"];
    settings.preserve_mac_from_state_image = options["preserve_mac_from_state_image"];

    if(options["network_relay_url"])
    {
        this.network_adapter = new NetworkAdapter(options["network_relay_url"], this.bus);
    }
```

**Resolution rationale:**
- The HEAD branch added default values for UART ports (uart1-uart3) - kept as they provide sensible defaults
- The other branch added cmdline and preserve_mac_from_state_image - preserved as they are required configuration options
- Both changes are complementary and address different aspects of the settings object
- No functional overlap or conflicts in logic between the two changesets
- Combined configuration maintains original code structure and formatting
