```javascript
        if (!data) {
            last_image_data = null;
            return;
        }

        let delay = parseInt(settings.funcaptcha_solve_delay_time);
        delay = delay ? delay : 1000;
        const delta = settings.funcaptcha_solve_delay ? (delay - (Time.time() - solve_start)) : 0;
        if (delta > 0) {
            await Time.sleep(delta);
        }

        // Solve

```

**Resolution Analysis:**  
1. The `delay` variable properly captures the intent of allowing users to configure solve delay time via settings (`funcaptcha_solve_delay_time`)
2. The explicit `parseInt` with fallback to 1000 maintains defensive programming practices against invalid inputs
3. The delta calculation from `HEAD` preserves the semantic relationship:  
   - If solve delay is enabled (`funcaptcha_solve_delay`), use calculated delay based on settings value  
   - If disabled, maintain 0 delay for uninterrupted execution  
4. The hardcoded `1000` value from the other branch loses configurability without providing any safety benefits (as invalid values are already handled)  

This resolution maintains all functional intent while keeping the code extensible through configuration.
