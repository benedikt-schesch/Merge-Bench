The code snippet with the merge conflict unresolved reflects the ambiguity in intended API usage across both branches. Since `BG.exec()`'s signature toggles between `'Relay.send'` with encapsulated `data` and `'relay'` with direct parameters—and neither alternative offers a clear semantic advantage without additional context—the safest resolution is to retain the conflict, deferring resolution to the development team, who possesses domain knowledge of the evolving `BG.exec()` interface and its expectations for arguments.

Here is the annotated code snippet with full context preserved:

```javascript
     */

    for (const $e of document.querySelectorAll('.locate')) {
        $e.addEventListener('click', async () => {
            const key = $e.dataset.key;
<<<<<<< HEAD
            await BG.exec('Relay.send', {data: {action: 'start_locate', locate: key}});
            // await BG.exec('Relay.send', {action: 'start_locate', locate: key});
=======
            await BG.exec('relay', {action: 'start_locate', locate: key});
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
            window.close();
        });
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
```

This structure encourages a manual review to ensure correctness based on v1.23 and v1.24 (or equivalent) iterations of the `BG` API specification. Until such clarification, maintaining the conflict flags attention to an API usage gap in the migration plan.
