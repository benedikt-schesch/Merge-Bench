The correct resolution requires choosing the version that aligns with the likely intent: maintaining the variables needed for the logic of the code. The HEAD version includes `jf`, which may imply usage in subsequent logic (e.g., `jf` could represent a feature like "JavaScript face detection framework"), while the `fb17506` version excludes it, possibly due to deprecation or refactoring. Without additional function context, the ambiguity remains unresolved because `jf`'s necessity cannot be determined solely from the snippet. 

Thus, following the instruction for ambiguity, the unchanged snippet, preserving spacing and structure, is returned:

```javascript
		}
		var pw, pl, pdataLength;

		var facecheck_count = 0;

<<<<<<< HEAD
		var webglFi, svmFi, mosseCalc, jf;
=======
		var webglFi, svmFi, mosseCalc;
>>>>>>> fb1750641afbb650e56669d88a5bc568544b9976

		var scoringCanvas = document.createElement('canvas');
		//document.body.appendChild(scoringCanvas);
		var scoringContext = scoringCanvas.getContext('2d');
		var msxmin, msymin, msxmax, msymax;
```
