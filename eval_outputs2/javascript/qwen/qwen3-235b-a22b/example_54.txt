The intent of both merge branches appears to be consistent: storing a CSS selector when an element is clicked by calling a background function. The conflict lies in the method name passed to `BG.exec`.

- **HEAD change**: Uses `'Settings.set'` — suggesting a namespaced method consistent with object-oriented style.
- **Remote change**: Uses `'set_settings'` — suggesting a snake_case function name, possibly from a refactored API name.

**Ambiguity**: Both styles could align with `BG`'s implementation, and there is insufficient context to determine the intended method name for `BG.exec`.

Therefore, the safest action is to preserve the conflict markers for explicit resolution by the user or team.

```javascript
    function on_click(event) {
        // Save the selected element
        const $e = event.target;
        const selector = nopecha_selector.get_css($e);
<<<<<<< HEAD
        BG.exec('Settings.set', {id: nopecha_selector.locate, value: selector});
=======
        BG.exec('set_settings', {id: nopecha_selector.locate, value: selector});
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        stop(true);
    }

    function on_mousemove(event) {
        // Update highlight overlay when new element is targeted
```
