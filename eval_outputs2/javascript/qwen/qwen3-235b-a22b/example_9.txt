The given merge conflict centers around the addition of the variable `consoleErrorMock` in one branch (HEAD) and its absence in the other (487eb85). Both branches appear to be setting up a testing environment involving the React `act` implementation and possibly mocking capabilities, based on naming and usage of `jest.resetModules()` and the requiring of `act`.

---

### Evaluation of Semantic Intent

- **HEAD Branch** includes `consoleErrorMock` in the list of declared variables.
  - This implies that `consoleErrorMock` may be intended for use in test setup, likely to intercept and verify calls to `console.error` via Jest, as indicated by the naming convention (`Mock`).
  
- **487eb85 Branch** does **not** include `consoleErrorMock`.
  - This could either suggest that this branch does not rely on the variable in its tests or that the branch predates the addition of this capability.

---

### Conflict Resolution Consideration

The key to resolving merge conflicts semantically is to determine whether both changes reflect intended and compatible behavior.

- Both branches agree on the presence and need for `act`, `asyncAct`, and `React`, suggesting that these are central to the test setup.
- The addition of `consoleErrorMock` in one branch introduces a new tool for test assertions but is **not used directly in the code snippet provided**.
  - No usage is shown of `consoleErrorMock` in the `beforeEach` block or in any test cases. Therefore, it is **not clear whether this variable is actively utilized** in any currently intended behavior.

---

### Conclusion

Since the variable `consoleErrorMock` is declared in one branch but not in the other, and since it is **not visibly utilized** within the provided context, the intent behind this change is ambiguous.

As per the instructions, **if the intent is ambiguous or uncertain**, the code snippet should be **returned unchanged**, preserving the conflict markers for manual resolution by a developer who has full context.
