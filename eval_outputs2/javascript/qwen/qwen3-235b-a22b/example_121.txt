The conflict arises between two valid intentions in the merging branches. On one side, `jf` is added among the declared variables; on the other, it is not included. Both sides are syntactically correct and preserve the overall structure. However, due to the lack of further contextual or semantic evidence (such as how or if the `jf` variable is used in the logic that follows), the resolution cannot be definitively determined.

Given the ambiguity regarding whether `jf` is necessary for the logic in the merged branch (especially without visibility into dependent code), it is prudent to preserve the original conflict markers and return the snippet as provided, without resolution.
