The provided code snippet contains a merge conflict in the test framework dependencies and assertion libraries used. The `HEAD` version imports from Node's built-in test and assertion modules (`node:test` and `node:assert`), which are standard for Node.js testing. Meanwhile, the merged branch introduces `uvu` and its assertion module (`uvu/assert`), a minimalist and browser-compatible test framework commonly used in browser testing scenarios.

---

The code following the merge conflict iterates over both environments (`'node'` and `'browser'`), suggesting the intent is to test both the Node and browser versions of the code. This raises the question of whether the test framework should switch based on the environment, or whether a unified test runner like `uvu` could be used across both.

However, there is ambiguity in the intent here. The original branch may have preferred Node's built-in modules for integration and simplicity, while the incoming branch may aim for broader compatibility using `uvu`. Without further context indicating which direction should take precedence or how to reconcile both, choosing one over the other risks misrepresenting the actual development intent.

As such, based on the instruction that unresolved or ambiguous semantic intent should retain the original conflict markers, the appropriate response is to return the code with the conflict preserved as-is.

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
import { equal, match, notEqual, ok } from 'node:assert'
import { after, before, describe, test } from 'node:test'
=======
let { test } = require('uvu')
let { is, ok, equal, match, not } = require('uvu/assert')
