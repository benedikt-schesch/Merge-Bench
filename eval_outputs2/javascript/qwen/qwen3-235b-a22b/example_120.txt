As the two versions of the code express divergent intents — one aiming to return a value to the caller of the function, and the other aiming to pass the data to a `callback` function — the semantic intent behind the change is ambiguous without additional context. There is no clear justification to choose one resolution over the other based solely on the provided snippet.

Here is the code snippet, unchanged and preserving all spacing and context:

```javascript
				currentParameters[3] = translateY;
			}

			currentPositions = calculatePositions(currentParameters, true);

<<<<<<< HEAD
			return [scaling, rotation, translateX, translateY];
=======
			callback([scaling, rotation, translateX, translateY]);
>>>>>>> fb1750641afbb650e56669d88a5bc568544b9976
		}

		// draw a parametrized line on a canvas
		var drawPath = function(canvasContext, path, dp) {
			canvasContext.beginPath();
```
