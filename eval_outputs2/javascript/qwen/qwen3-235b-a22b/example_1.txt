```javascript
} from '../../utils/url.js';
import { exec } from '../../utils/routing.js';
import { redirect_json_response, render_data } from './data/index.js';
import { add_cookies_to_headers, get_cookies } from './cookie.js';
import { create_fetch } from './fetch.js';
import { HttpError, Redirect, NotFound } from '../control.js';
import {
	validate_layout_exports,
	validate_layout_server_exports,
	validate_page_exports,
	validate_page_server_exports,
``` 

The conflict was resolved by merging both import sets while preserving `Redirect` (used in both branches) and adding both `HttpError` (from HEAD) and `NotFound` (from merged branch). This maintains semantic intent from both sides without removing functionality.
