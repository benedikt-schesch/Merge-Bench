Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Wants to add code that creates/updates an inode with `updatedir = true` and `nlinks = 2`, then pushes it to the inodes array
- **Right side (8107f26...)**: Wants to remove this code entirely, keeping only the for loop that loads children

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD is trying to ensure proper inode initialization for a directory before loading its children
- The other branch seems to have refactored this logic elsewhere or determined it's unnecessary

Without more context about where the inode initialization might have been moved to in the right branch, or whether it's truly no longer needed, I cannot make a safe determination about which approach is correct.

```javascript
    }
};

FS.prototype.LoadDir = function(parentid, children)
{
<<<<<<< HEAD
    inode.updatedir = true;
    inode.nlinks = 2; // . and ..

    var p = this.inodes.length;
    this.PushInode(inode);

    for(var i = 0; i < children.length; i++) {
        this.LoadRecursive(children[i], parentid);
    }
};
