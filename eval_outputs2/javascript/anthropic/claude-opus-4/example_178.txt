Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - formatting the `bingUrl` variable. The conflict appears to be purely stylistic:

- HEAD version: Keeps the template literal on one line
- Other version: Breaks the template literal across multiple lines for better readability

The HEAD version also adds a `userAgent` constant that isn't present in the other version.

Since both versions have the same semantic intent (constructing the same URL), I'll resolve this by keeping the more readable multi-line format from the other version while preserving the `userAgent` addition from HEAD:

```javascript
        click: (menuItem, browserWindow, event) => isDevelopmentHandler(menuItem, browserWindow, event),
      },
    ],
  })
  // Load Bing
  const bingUrl = `https://edgeservices.bing.com/edgediscover/query?&${
    isDarkMode ? 'dark' : 'light'
  }schemeovr=1&FORM=SHORUN&udscs=1&udsnav=1&setlang=${locale}&features=udssydinternal&clientscopes=windowheader,coauthor,chat,&udsframed=1`
  const userAgent =
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/115.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'
  mainWindow.loadURL(bingUrl)
  // Open links in default browser
  mainWindow.webContents.setWindowOpenHandler(({ url }) => {
    shell.openExternal(url)
    return { action: 'deny' }
```
