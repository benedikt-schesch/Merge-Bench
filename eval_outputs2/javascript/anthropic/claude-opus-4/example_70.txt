Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to calculate a delay before submitting, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Introduces a configurable delay time from `settings.recaptcha_solve_delay_time`, with a fallback to 1000ms
- **BASE**: Uses a hardcoded delay of 1000ms

The intent from both sides appears to be the same - to implement a delay mechanism before submission. The HEAD version is more flexible by allowing configuration, which seems like the better approach.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```javascript
            headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},
            body: 'input=' + encodeURIComponent(src_url) + '&lang=' + lang,
        });
        document.querySelector('#audio-response').value = res;

        let delay = parseInt(settings.recaptcha_solve_delay_time);
        delay = delay ? delay : 1000;
        const delta = settings.recaptcha_solve_delay ? (delay - (Time.time() - solve_start)) : 0;
        if (delta > 0) {
            await Time.sleep(delta);
        }

        submit();

```
