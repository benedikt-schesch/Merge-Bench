Looking at this merge conflict, I need to analyze the semantic intent of both sides:

**HEAD side**: 
- Makes `theme` optional (`theme?: Theme`)
- Uses regular object type (no exact object type)

**Incoming change (dae1bf2)**: 
- Makes `theme` required (`theme: Theme`)
- Uses exact object type (`{| ... |}`)

The conflict appears to be about two design decisions:
1. Whether `theme` should be optional or required
2. Whether the object type should be exact or regular

Without more context about the broader codebase and the intent of these changes, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The two changes represent potentially incompatible design decisions that need human judgment to resolve based on the project's requirements.

Here's the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
  managers?: Managers,
  sheetOptions: StyleSheetOptions,
  disableStylesGeneration: boolean
|}

<<<<<<< HEAD
export type HOCProps<Theme, Props> = Props & {
  theme?: Theme,
=======
export type HOCProps<Theme, Props> = Props & {|
  theme: Theme,
>>>>>>> dae1bf2b42e46270f3625b5d1dabaccea2aeda17
  jssContext: Context,
  innerRef: any
}

export type Classes = {[string]: string}

```
