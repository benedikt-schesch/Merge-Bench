Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they're checking if an imported SVG symbol exists and has parents in the DOM. The conflict appears to be about:

1. **Naming change**: `svgCanvas` vs `svgContext_` - The right side (279bdc7) appears to be renaming the variable from `svgCanvas` to `svgContext_`
2. **Optional chaining**: The right side adds optional chaining (`parents?.length`) instead of just `parents.length`

Both changes seem intentional and compatible. The naming change is consistent across both calls to `getImportIds()`, and the optional chaining is a defensive programming improvement that prevents errors if `parents` is null/undefined.

Here's the resolved conflict accepting both changes:

```javascript
    // Get unique ID
    const uid = encode64(xmlString.length + xmlString).substr(0, 32);

    let useExisting = false;
    // Look for symbol and make sure symbol exists in image
    if (svgContext_.getImportIds(uid) && svgContext_.getImportIds(uid).symbol) {
      const parents = getParents(svgContext_.getImportIds(uid).symbol, '#svgroot');
      if (parents?.length) {
        useExisting = true;
      }
    }

    const batchCmd = new BatchCommand('Import Image');
