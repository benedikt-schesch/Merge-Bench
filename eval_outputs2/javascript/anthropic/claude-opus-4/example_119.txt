Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - dispatching an event when tracking is lost. The only difference is that one side (HEAD) is missing a semicolon at the end of the `document.dispatchEvent(evt)` statement, while the other side has it.

In JavaScript, semicolons are generally recommended for clarity and to avoid potential issues with automatic semicolon insertion. The intent on both sides is identical - to dispatch the event. The version with the semicolon follows better coding practices.

Here's the resolved version:

```javascript
					}

					// send event to signal that tracking was lost
					var evt = document.createEvent("Event");
					evt.initEvent("clmtrackrLost", true, true);
					document.dispatchEvent(evt);

					return false;
				}
			}


```
