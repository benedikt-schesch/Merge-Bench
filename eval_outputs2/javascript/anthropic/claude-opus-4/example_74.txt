Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Has no content between the async function opening and the `is_widget_frame()` function
- **Other branch** (07dbd1e): Has two empty lines between the async function opening and the `is_widget_frame()` function

This appears to be a simple whitespace/formatting conflict. Both sides have the same functional code - an async IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) with an `is_widget_frame()` function inside it. The only difference is the number of blank lines.

Since this is purely a formatting difference with no semantic changes, I'll resolve it by keeping a reasonable amount of whitespace (one blank line) for readability:

```javascript
(async () => {

    function is_widget_frame() {
        return document.querySelector('.recaptcha-checkbox') !== null;
    }



```
