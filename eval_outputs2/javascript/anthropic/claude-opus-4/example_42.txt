Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve similar functionality with slightly different approaches:

1. **HEAD** branch: Has a method named `createFakeElement()` that checks RTL direction using `==`
2. **Other branch**: Has a method named `selectFake()` that checks RTL direction using `===` (strict equality)

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both are creating a fake textarea element and checking for RTL direction. The differences are:
- Method name (`createFakeElement` vs `selectFake`)
- Equality operator (`==` vs `===`)

Since the JSDoc comment above says "Creates a fake textarea element", the method name `createFakeElement()` from HEAD seems more descriptive and aligned with the documentation. However, using strict equality `===` is a JavaScript best practice.

Here's the resolved version combining the better aspects of both:

```javascript
    }
  }
  /**
   * Creates a fake textarea element, sets its value from `text` property,
   */
  createFakeElement() {
    const isRTL = document.documentElement.getAttribute('dir') === 'rtl';

    this.fakeElem = document.createElement('textarea');
    // Prevent zooming on iOS
    this.fakeElem.style.fontSize = '12pt';
    // Reset box model

```
