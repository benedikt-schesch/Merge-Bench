Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import testing utilities, but using different approaches:

- HEAD side: Uses Node.js built-in test framework (`node:test`) and assertion methods from `node:assert`
- Other side: Uses the `uvu` testing framework and its assertion methods

Since the HEAD side is using the more modern Node.js built-in testing framework with ES modules (import syntax), while the other side is using CommonJS (require) with the uvu framework, and the rest of the visible code uses ES module imports (`import { urlAlphabet }...`), I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version as it's more consistent with the module system being used in the file.

```javascript
import { equal, match, notEqual, ok } from 'node:assert'
import { describe, test } from 'node:test'

import { urlAlphabet } from '../index.js'
import { customAlphabet, nanoid } from '../non-secure/index.js'

describe('non secure', () => {

```
