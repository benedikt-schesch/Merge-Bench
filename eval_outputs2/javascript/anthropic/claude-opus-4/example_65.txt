Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) wants to keep a blank line between the event listener and the comment block, while the other side wants to remove that blank line.

Since this is purely a formatting/whitespace difference with no semantic changes, I'll preserve the version with the blank line as it provides better visual separation between the event handler and the next section of code with its comment block.

```javascript
        if (e.key === 'Backspace' && !(e.target instanceof HTMLInputElement)) {
            back();
        }
    });


    /**
     * Set UI from settings and attach listeners
     */

    for (const [k, v] of Object.entries(settings)) {

```
