Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to retrieve settings, but using different method names:
- HEAD uses `Settings.get`
- The incoming change uses `get_settings`

The HEAD version also includes a console.log statement for debugging.

Since both sides have the same intent (retrieving settings) but different implementations, and without more context about which method name is correct in the codebase, I'll preserve the conflict as-is:

```javascript
    rendering_server_plan = false;
}


async function init_ui() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const settings = await BG.exec('Settings.get');
    console.log('settings', settings);

=======
    const settings = await BG.exec('get_settings');
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24

    /**
     * Power button
     */


```
