Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import similar utilities but with some differences:

1. **Path differences**: The HEAD branch uses relative paths from a subdirectory (`../utils`, `../helpers/`, etc.) while the other branch uses paths from the current directory (`./utils`, `./helpers/`, etc.). This suggests the file was moved from `lib/defaults.js` to `lib/defaults/index.js`.

2. **Module differences**: 
   - HEAD imports `enhanceError` and `transitionalDefaults`
   - The other branch imports `AxiosError` instead

Since `AxiosError` appears to be a replacement/evolution of `enhanceError` (common in error handling refactoring), and the file has been reorganized into a subdirectory, the semantic intent seems to be to:
- Use the new file location paths (from HEAD)
- Use the updated error handling module (from the other branch)
- Keep the transitional defaults (from HEAD)

Here's the resolved version:

```javascript
'use strict';

var utils = require('../utils');
var normalizeHeaderName = require('../helpers/normalizeHeaderName');
var AxiosError = require('../core/AxiosError');
var transitionalDefaults = require('./transitional');

var DEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
};
