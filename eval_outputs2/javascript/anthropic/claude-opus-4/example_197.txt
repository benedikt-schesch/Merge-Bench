Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - checking that console.error and console.warn were not called. The semantic intent is identical.

The differences are:
- HEAD uses `Array []` syntax for the expected empty array
- The other branch uses `[]` syntax and adds type casting with `(console.error: any)`

Since both achieve the same result and the newer/more concise syntax from the branch seems preferable, I'll resolve by using the branch version:

```javascript
        hydrate: true,
        container: safeQuerySelector('#root')
      }
    )

    expect((console.error: any).mock.calls).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`[]`)
    expect((console.warn: any).mock.calls).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`[]`)
  })

  test('no hydration mismatch for ClassNames when using useId', async () => {
    const finalHTML = await disableBrowserEnvTemporarily(() => {
      resetAllModules()

```
