Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import necessary dependencies for what appears to be a test file for Vuex.

The HEAD branch is importing:
- `nextTick` from 'vue' (suggesting Vue 3 compatibility)
- `mount` from a local test helper

The other branch is importing:
- `Vue` from 'vue' (suggesting Vue 2 compatibility)

Since both sides need Vue-related imports and the file appears to be testing Vuex, the semantic intent is to have the necessary imports for testing. Without more context about which version of Vue is being targeted or whether both imports are needed, I'll return the conflict as-is:

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
import { nextTick } from 'vue'
import { mount } from './support/helpers'
=======
import Vue from 'vue'
>>>>>>> ce0c88a81703017cad63e4b5a913eff6349f585a
import Vuex from '../../src/index'

const TEST = 'TEST'
const isSSR = process.env.VUE_ENV === 'server'
```
