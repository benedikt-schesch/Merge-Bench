Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - checking that console.error and console.warn were not called. The conflict appears to be about:

1. **Type casting syntax**: HEAD uses untyped access while the other branch uses Flow type casting `(console.error: any)`
2. **Snapshot format**: HEAD uses `Array []` while the other branch uses just `[]`

Both changes appear to be part of a broader refactoring - the Flow type casting suggests TypeScript/Flow type safety improvements, while the snapshot format change suggests an update to Jest's inline snapshot format.

Since both sides have the same semantic intent and the second branch appears to be a more modern approach (with type safety and updated snapshot format), I'll resolve in favor of the second branch:

```javascript
  render(<App />, {
    hydrate: true,
    container: safeQuerySelector('#root')
  })

  expect((console.error: any).mock.calls).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`[]`)
  expect((console.warn: any).mock.calls).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`[]`)
})

test('initializing another Emotion instance should not move already moved styles elements', () => {
  safeQuerySelector('head').innerHTML = '<div id="style-container"></div>'
  safeQuerySelector('body').innerHTML = [

```
