Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) wants to keep the code without the Date.now polyfill, while the other side (be83c580c37d0c6182b008a7bf086541530398b8) wants to add a Date.now polyfill.

The Date.now polyfill is a common compatibility shim for older browsers that don't support Date.now() natively. Since this appears to be a utility module (based on the Util object being defined), including the polyfill here makes semantic sense - it ensures Date.now() is available before any other code in this module might use it.

The intent from the branch adding the polyfill is clearly to provide backwards compatibility. The HEAD branch either removed it or never had it, but there's no indication that having the polyfill would cause issues.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
 */

;(function(exports) {

  // Date.now polyfill
  Date.now = Date.now || function() { return new Date().getTime(); };

  var Util = {
    extend: function() {
      arguments[0] = arguments[0] || {};
      for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++)
      {

```
