Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - they both want to close something with `})();`. The only difference is that HEAD has it on the same line while the other branch has a blank line before it.

Since both sides have the same semantic intent (closing a function or IIFE), I'll resolve this by keeping one version. I'll choose the version with the blank line as it provides better readability:

```javascript
// #href

//keep adding and testing!


})();

```
