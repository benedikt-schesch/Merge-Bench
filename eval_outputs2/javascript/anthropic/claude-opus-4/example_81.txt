Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different imports to the same file. The HEAD branch is adding file system utilities (`rimrafSync`, `copydirSync`) and some constants, while the other branch is adding URL and HTTPS proxy agent imports.

Since these imports serve different purposes and don't conflict semantically, the resolution should include both sets of imports. Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import https from 'https';
import child_process from 'child_process';
import { rimrafSync, copydirSync } from 'sander';
import URL from 'url';
import httpsProxyAgent from 'https-proxy-agent';

const tmpDirName = 'tmp';
const degitConfigName = 'degit.json';

export { degitConfigName };

export class DegitError extends Error {
	constructor(message, opts) {
		super(message);
		Object.assign(this, opts);

```
