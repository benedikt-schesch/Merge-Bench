Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that one side (HEAD) added "4th commit" to the comment block, while the other side (commit 1335f12) did not include this addition. 

Since this appears to be a simple addition to a comment block listing commits, and maintaining a complete history of test commits seems to be the intent, I'll resolve this by keeping the "4th commit" line.

```javascript
/* To test commit 1
    To Test commit 2
    To Test Commit 3
    4th commit
    cycle.js
