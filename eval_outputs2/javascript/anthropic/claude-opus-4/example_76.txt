Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the config when `isMobile()` is true, but they're making different changes:

- HEAD sets both `DYE_RESOLUTION = 256` and `SHADING = false`
- The other branch only sets `DYE_RESOLUTION = 256`

Following this, there's another condition that sets `SHADING = false` when linear filtering is not supported.

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides agree that mobile devices should have `DYE_RESOLUTION = 256`
2. HEAD additionally wants to disable shading on mobile devices
3. Both sides agree that shading should be disabled when linear filtering is not supported

The most complete resolution would be to keep HEAD's version since it includes both config changes for mobile devices, while the other branch's change is a subset of HEAD's changes.

```javascript

var ref = getWebGLContext(canvas);
var gl = ref.gl;
var ext = ref.ext;

if (isMobile()) {
    config.DYE_RESOLUTION = 256;
    config.SHADING = false;
}
if (!ext.supportLinearFiltering)
    { config.SHADING = false; }

startGUI();
