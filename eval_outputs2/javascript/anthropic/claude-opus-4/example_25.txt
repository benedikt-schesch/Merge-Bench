Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to configure the same `basedir` property, but the right side (from commit f0b94b1) also adds an additional `directMode: true` property.

Since both sides agree on the `basedir: resolve('./dist')` setting, and the right side is adding an additional configuration option rather than conflicting with the intent of the left side, the semantic resolution would be to keep both the `basedir` property and the new `directMode` property.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
    cache: LRU({
      max: 1000,
      maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 15
    }),
    // this is only needed when vue-server-renderer is npm-linked
    basedir: resolve('./dist'),
    directMode: true
  }))
}

let renderer


```
