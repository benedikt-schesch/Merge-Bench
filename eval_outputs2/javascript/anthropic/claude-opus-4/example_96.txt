Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the `options` object with default values. The HEAD version has the basic properties, while the incoming change adds an additional property `scalePercentBy100`.

Since both sides share the same base properties and the incoming change is simply adding one more property without modifying the existing ones, the semantic intent is to extend the options object with the new property while keeping all existing properties.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
        },
        options = {
            currentLocale: defaults.currentLocale,
            zeroFormat: defaults.zeroFormat,
            nullFormat: defaults.nullFormat,
            defaultFormat: defaults.defaultFormat,
            scalePercentBy100: defaults.scalePercentBy100
        };
