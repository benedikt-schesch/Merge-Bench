Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to retrieve settings from a background service (BG), but they're using different method names:

- HEAD uses: `Settings.get`
- The incoming branch uses: `get_settings`

Without more context about which is the correct API or whether there was a refactoring to change the method name, I cannot determine which one is semantically correct. The conflict appears to be about different naming conventions for the same functionality.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
            await Time.sleep(500);
        }

        const {task, task_url, cells, urls} = await on_task_ready();

<<<<<<< HEAD
        const settings = await BG.exec('Settings.get');
=======
        const settings = await BG.exec('get_settings');
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        if (!settings.enabled || !settings.hcaptcha_auto_solve) {
            return;
        }

        const solve_start = Time.time();

```
