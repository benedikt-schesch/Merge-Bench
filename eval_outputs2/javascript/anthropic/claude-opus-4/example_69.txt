Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to calculate a delay before submitting a solution. The key difference is:

- HEAD version: Introduces a configurable delay time from `settings.recaptcha_solve_delay_time`, with a fallback to 1000ms
- Other version: Uses a hardcoded 1000ms delay

The HEAD version appears to be adding more flexibility by making the delay configurable, while maintaining backward compatibility with the default 1000ms value. This seems like an intentional enhancement to allow users to customize the delay time.

Here's the resolved conflict that preserves the more flexible, configurable approach:

```javascript
        });
        if (!data) {
            return;
        }

        let delay = parseInt(settings.recaptcha_solve_delay_time);
        delay = delay ? delay : 1000;
        const delta = settings.recaptcha_solve_delay ? (delay - (Time.time() - solve_start)) : 0;
        if (delta > 0) {
            await Time.sleep(delta);
        }

        // Submit solution

```
