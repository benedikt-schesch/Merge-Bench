Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to set a default value for the parameter `i` in the `on_task_ready` function. The HEAD branch wants `i=500` while the incoming branch wants `i=200`. 

Since I cannot determine the semantic intent behind why each side chose their specific value (500 vs 200) without more context about what this parameter represents or how it's used in the function, I'll return the snippet with the conflict unresolved:

```javascript
        return new_task.join('');
    }


    let last_urls_hash = null;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    function on_task_ready(i=500) {
=======
    function on_task_ready(i=200) {
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        return new Promise(resolve => {
            let checking = false;
            const check_interval = setInterval(async () => {
                if (checking) {
                    return;

```
