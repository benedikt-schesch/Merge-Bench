Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to access a port configuration for weinre, but they're using different property names:

- HEAD (current branch) uses: `config.port`
- The incoming change uses: `config.weinreport`

The semantic intent appears to be accessing the weinre port configuration. The incoming change seems to be using a more specific property name (`weinreport`) that clearly indicates it's the port specifically for weinre, rather than a generic `port` property.

Given that this is specifically for weinre functionality (as evidenced by the variable name `weinrePath` and the context), the more specific `config.weinreport` appears to be the semantically correct choice.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
var weinreScriptFile = path.join(config.ASSESTS_PATH, 'js/weinre.js');
var weinreScript = fs.readFileSync(weinreScriptFile, {encoding: 'utf8'});
var weinreHtmlScript = '\r\n<script>' + weinreScript + '</script>\r\n';

function getScript(host, name, isHtml, isHttps) {
  var weinrePath = config.WEBUI_PATH + 'weinre.' + config.weinreport;
  var result = weinreHtmlScript;
  if (!isHtml) {
    result = weinreScript;
    weinrePath = (isHttps ? 'https://' : 'http://') + host + weinrePath;
  }

```
