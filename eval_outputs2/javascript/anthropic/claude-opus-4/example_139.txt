Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update version information for the same library (leon-sans.com).

The conflict shows:
- HEAD has VERSION: 1.6.3, DATE: 2019-09-13
- The incoming branch has VERSION: 1.6.1, DATE: 2019-09-05

Since version 1.6.3 is newer than 1.6.1, and the date 2019-09-13 is more recent than 2019-09-05, the semantic intent appears to be keeping the most recent version. Therefore, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version:

```javascript
/*!
 * VERSION: 1.6.3
 * DATE: 2019-09-13
 * https://leon-sans.com
 *
 * @license Copyright (c) 2019, Jongmin Kim. All rights reserved.

import {
