Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to configure the QianWenBot class with slightly different values:

1. **Logo filename path**: HEAD uses `public/bots/` while the other branch uses `assets/bots/`
2. **Login URL**: HEAD uses `https://tongyi.aliyun.com/` while the other branch uses `https://qianwen.aliyun.com/`

Without additional context about which path structure and URL are correct for the current application, I cannot determine the semantically correct resolution. Both changes appear intentional but conflicting.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
}

export default class QianWenBot extends Bot {
  static _brandId = "qianWen"; // Brand id of the bot, should be unique. Used in i18n.
  static _className = "QianWenBot"; // Class name of the bot
<<<<<<< HEAD
  static _logoFilename = "qianwen-logo.png"; // Place it in public/bots/
  static _loginUrl = "https://tongyi.aliyun.com/";
=======
  static _logoFilename = "qianwen-logo.png"; // Place it in assets/bots/
  static _loginUrl = "https://qianwen.aliyun.com/";
>>>>>>> 7bf4a431d67458b38df2701bedf5041c817e1ff9
  static _lock = new AsyncLock(); // AsyncLock for prompt requests

  constructor() {
    super();
  }

```
