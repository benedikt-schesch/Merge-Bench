Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to calculate a delay before solving, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Introduces a configurable delay time from `settings.funcaptcha_solve_delay_time`, with a default of 1000ms if not set
- **Incoming branch**: Uses a hardcoded delay of 1000ms

The semantic intent appears to be the same - both want to enforce a minimum delay before solving. The HEAD version is more flexible as it allows configuration of the delay time, which seems like a better approach.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```javascript
        if (!data) {
            last_image_data = null;
            return;
        }

        let delay = parseInt(settings.funcaptcha_solve_delay_time);
        delay = delay ? delay : 1000;
        const delta = settings.funcaptcha_solve_delay ? (delay - (Time.time() - solve_start)) : 0;
        if (delta > 0) {
            await Time.sleep(delta);
        }

        // Solve

```
