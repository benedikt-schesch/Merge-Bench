Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add the same comment "// Back page" before the `back: null,` property. The only difference is that the HEAD version has no trailing space, while the other branch has a trailing space after "page".

Since the semantic intent is identical (adding a comment to describe the `back` property), and trailing spaces are generally considered insignificant in code, I'll resolve this by keeping the cleaner version without the trailing space:

```javascript

	// Default options used by flip

	flipOptions = {

		// Back page
		
		back: null,

		// Corners allowed
		// backward: Activates both tl and bl corners

```
