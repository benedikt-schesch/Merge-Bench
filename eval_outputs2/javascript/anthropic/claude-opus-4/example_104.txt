Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Has the negative number handling logic and then proceeds directly to the thousands separator logic.
- **Incoming change**: Adds logic to pad the integer part with leading zeros based on a `leadingCount` variable before applying the thousands separator.

Both changes appear to be adding different features that don't conflict semantically:
1. The negative number handling (HEAD) processes the sign
2. The leading zero padding (incoming) formats the number with a specific width
3. Both then want to apply thousands separators

These features are complementary and should both be included in sequence. The logical order would be:
1. Handle negative sign first
2. Add leading zeros to achieve desired width
3. Apply thousands separators

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
            if (numeral._.includes(int, '-')) {
                int = int.slice(1);
                neg = true;
            }

            if (int.length < leadingCount) {
                for (var i = leadingCount - int.length; i > 0; i--) {
                    int = '0' + int;
                }
            }

            if (thousands > -1) {
                int = int.toString().replace(/(\d)(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, '$1' + locale.delimiters.thousands);
            }

            if (format.indexOf('.') === 0) {

```
