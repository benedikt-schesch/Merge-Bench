Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the method name for setting a preference/setting through the background (BG) API. The semantic intent is the same - both want to save a setting with an id and value.

The conflict is between:
- HEAD: `'Settings.set'`
- Incoming: `'set_settings'`

Since both sides have the same intent but are using different API method naming conventions, I need more context about the codebase to determine which naming convention is correct. Without knowing which API method name is the current/correct one in the codebase, I cannot confidently resolve this conflict.

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
            $toggle.classList.remove('on', 'off');
            $toggle.classList.add(v ? 'on' : 'off');
            // Listen
            $toggle.addEventListener('click', async () => {
                const value = $toggle.classList.contains('off');
<<<<<<< HEAD
                await BG.exec('Settings.set', {id: k, value: value});
=======
                await BG.exec('set_settings', {id: k, value: value});
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
                $toggle.classList.remove('on', 'off');
                $toggle.classList.add(value ? 'on' : 'off');
            });
        }
