Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import the same modules from `@apollo/client`, just with different import styles:

- HEAD: Separate imports for `ApolloClient` and `InMemoryCache`
- The other branch: Combined import statement

Since both achieve the same result (importing the necessary modules), I'll resolve this by using the more concise combined import statement, which is generally preferred in modern JavaScript:

```javascript
 * (necessary for SSR)
 *
 * /!\ It must be recreated on every request
 */

import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

import { SchemaLink } from '@apollo/client/link/schema';
import { GraphQLSchema } from '../graphql/index.js';


```
