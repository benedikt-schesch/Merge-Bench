Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import the necessary dependencies for testing a Vuex store, but they're using different approaches:

- **HEAD** (incoming changes): Uses Vue 3 style imports with `nextTick` from 'vue' and a custom `mount` helper
- **ce0c88a81** (current branch): Uses Vue 2 style with direct Vue import

The conflict also shows different import paths for Vuex:
- **HEAD**: Uses a relative path `../../src/index`
- **ce0c88a81**: Uses an alias path `@/index`

Without more context about which version of Vue this codebase is targeting or which import style is preferred, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict. The semantic intent of both sides is to set up the necessary imports for Vuex store testing, but they represent different architectural decisions (Vue 2 vs Vue 3, relative vs alias imports).

Here is the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
import { nextTick } from 'vue'
import { mount } from './support/helpers'
import Vuex from '../../src/index'
=======
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuex from '@/index'
>>>>>>> ce0c88a81703017cad63e4b5a913eff6349f585a

const TEST = 'TEST'
const isSSR = process.env.VUE_ENV === 'server'

describe('Store', () => {
```
