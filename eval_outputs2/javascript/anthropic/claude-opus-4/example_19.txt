Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic goal - they're both setting up a test for `scaleGradient` with a zero-span domain. The only difference is:

- HEAD uses `let` with arrow function syntax
- The other branch uses `const` with traditional function syntax

Since the variable `s` is never reassigned in the visible code, `const` is more semantically appropriate. The choice between arrow function and traditional function syntax is less critical here, but for consistency with modern JavaScript practices and since there's no need for `this` binding, the arrow function syntax is preferable.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
var tape = require('tape'),
    {scale} = require('vega-scale'),
    {scaleGradient} = require('../');

tape('scaleGradient handles zero-span domain', t => {
  const s = scale('linear')().range(['#f00', '#00f']);

  function testGradient(domain) {
    const g = scaleGradient.call({}, s.domain(domain), [0, 0], [1, 0], 3),
          n = g.stops.length - 1;


```
