Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - checking if the `props` object has its own `css` property. The conflict arose because:

- HEAD version uses `hasOwnProperty.call(props, 'css')`
- The incoming change uses `hasOwn.call(props, 'css')` and adds TypeScript type annotations

Since `hasOwn` is already imported from `'./utils'` at the top of the file, and both methods achieve the same goal (checking for own property), the semantic intent is clear. The incoming change also adds type annotations which is a common improvement for TypeScript compatibility.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
import Emotion, { createEmotionProps } from './emotion-element'
import { hasOwn } from './utils'

export const Fragment = ReactJSXRuntime.Fragment

export function jsx(type: any, props: any, key: any) {
  if (!hasOwn.call(props, 'css')) {
    return ReactJSXRuntime.jsx(type, props, key)
  }

  return ReactJSXRuntime.jsx(Emotion, createEmotionProps(type, props), key)
}

```
