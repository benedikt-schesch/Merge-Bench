Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define a `getMaxY()` function, but the incoming change (HEAD) includes an important comment about an issue with a loop and the use of lodash's `_.max` utility. The bottom version appears to be the resolution attempt but is missing the comment.

The semantic intent here is to:
1. Keep the `getMax` iteratee function for lodash
2. Include the important comment about why lodash was chosen
3. Define the `getMaxY()` function

Here's the resolved version that preserves the full context and combines both intents:

```javascript

//iteratee for lodash _.max
    function getMax(v, i){
      return parseFloat(v);
    }
//for some reason this loop does not properly get the maxY if there are multiple datasets (was doing 4 datasets that differred wildly)
//just used lodash _.max utility
    function getMaxY() {
      if (self.options.maxY) {
        return self.options.maxY;
      }

```
