Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the unformat function for what appears to be percentage handling in a numeral formatting library.

The HEAD version simply multiplies the parsed number by 0.01 (converting percentage to decimal).

The incoming change introduces a conditional behavior based on a `scalePercentBy100` option - if this option is true, it multiplies by 0.01 (same as HEAD), otherwise it returns the number as-is.

The semantic intent appears to be:
- HEAD: Always convert percentages to decimals (divide by 100)
- Incoming: Make the percentage scaling configurable via an option

The incoming change is more flexible and includes the HEAD behavior as a special case, so the resolution should accept the incoming change:

```javascript
            }

            return output;
        },
        unformat: function(string) {
            var number = numeral._.stringToNumber(string);
            if (numeral.options.scalePercentBy100) {
                return number * 0.01;
            }
            return number;
        }
    });
})();
