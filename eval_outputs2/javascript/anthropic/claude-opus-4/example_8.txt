Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

**HEAD (left side)**: 
- Adds handling for destructuring assignments
- Adds a check for assignment operator "=" 
- Returns early if the operator is not "=" OR if left is not a SymbolRef

**Right side**: 
- Simplifies to just check if left is not a SymbolRef and return early

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to ensure we only process when `node.left` is a `SymbolRef`
2. HEAD adds special handling for destructuring cases
3. HEAD also wants to ensure the operator is "=" before proceeding

Looking at the code after the conflict, there's a check for `!fixed && node.operator != "="` which suggests the operator check is important for the logic flow.

The correct resolution should:
1. Keep the destructuring handling from HEAD (it's a valid case that needs special treatment)
2. Keep the operator check from HEAD (it's used in the logic below)
3. Maintain the check for SymbolRef

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
            return true;
        });
        def(AST_Arrow, mark_func_expr);
        def(AST_Assign, function(tw) {
            var node = this;
            if (node.left instanceof AST_Destructuring) {
                node.left.walk(suppressor);
                return;
            }
            if (node.operator != "=" || !(node.left instanceof AST_SymbolRef)) return;
            var d = node.left.definition();
            var fixed = d.fixed;
            if (!fixed && node.operator != "=") return;
            if (!safe_to_assign(tw, d, node.right)) return;
            d.references.push(node.left);

```
