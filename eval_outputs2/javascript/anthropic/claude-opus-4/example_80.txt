No reasoning found</think>
Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to set up the test suite configuration, but with different approaches:

- **HEAD**: Sets a timeout at the describe level using `function` syntax
- **Branch (7594d56...)**: Sets a timeout in a `beforeEach` hook using arrow function syntax

The semantic intent of both sides is to increase the timeout for tests (likely because CI environments need more time). The branch version is more explicit with the comment "CI takes a while to churn through these" and uses a specific timeout value (7500ms).

Since both sides want to achieve the same goal (setting a timeout), and the branch version is more explicit and uses a `beforeEach` pattern which is a common testing practice, I'll resolve in favor of the branch version:

```javascript
			fulfil();
		});
	});
}

describe('degit', () => {
	beforeEach(function() {
		// CI takes a while to churn through these.
		this.timeout(7500);
	});

	function compare(dir, files) {
		const expected = glob.sync('**', { cwd: dir });
		assert.deepEqual(Object.keys(files).sort(), expected.sort());
