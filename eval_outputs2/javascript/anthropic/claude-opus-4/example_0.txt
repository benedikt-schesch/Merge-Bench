Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import from `'../control.js'`, but with different sets of imports:

- HEAD (current branch): imports `HttpError` and `Redirect`
- Incoming branch: imports `HttpError`, `Redirect`, and `NotFound`, plus adds an import for `unwrap_promises`

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides need `HttpError` and `Redirect` from `../control.js`
2. The incoming branch additionally needs `NotFound` from the same module
3. The incoming branch also needs to import `unwrap_promises` from a different module

The resolution should include all the imports that either side needs:

```javascript

import { base } from '__sveltekit/paths';
import * as devalue from 'devalue';
import { compact } from '../../utils/array.js';
import { validate_page_exports } from '../../utils/exports.js';
import { unwrap_promises } from '../../utils/promises.js';
import { HttpError, Redirect, NotFound } from '../control.js';
import { INVALIDATED_PARAM, TRAILING_SLASH_PARAM, validate_depends } from '../shared.js';
import { INDEX_KEY, PRELOAD_PRIORITIES, SCROLL_KEY, SNAPSHOT_KEY } from './constants.js';
import { stores } from './singletons.js';

let errored = false;

```
