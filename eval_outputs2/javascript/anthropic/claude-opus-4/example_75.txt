Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to configure the `mangle` option for what appears to be a JavaScript minification tool (likely UglifyJS).

The conflict shows:
- HEAD (current branch): `mangle: { screw_ie8 : true, keep_fnames: true }`
- Incoming branch: `mangle: { screw_ie8 : true }`

The incoming branch also adds eslint disable/enable comments around the configuration to suppress camelCase warnings.

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want `screw_ie8: true` (to not support IE8)
2. HEAD wants to preserve function names with `keep_fnames: true`
3. The incoming branch wants to suppress eslint warnings about camelCase

The best resolution would be to combine both intents - keep the `keep_fnames: true` option from HEAD while also including the eslint comments from the incoming branch:

```javascript
      // }, // debug
      // comments: true, //debug


      beautify: false, //prod
      /* eslint-disable camelcase */
      mangle: { screw_ie8 : true, keep_fnames: true }, //prod
      compress: { screw_ie8: true }, //prod
      /* eslint-enable camelcase */
      comments: false //prod
    }),


```
