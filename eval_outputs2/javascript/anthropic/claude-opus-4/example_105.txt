Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the same configuration object. The conflict appears to be about:

- HEAD: Wants to keep the prettierConfig starting with `{` (no space)
- The incoming change: Wants to add `dateFormatISO8601: false,` and has prettierConfig starting with ` {` (with a space)

Since the semantic intent seems to be:
1. Add the new `dateFormatISO8601` configuration option
2. Keep the prettierConfig (the space difference is likely insignificant)

Here's the resolved version:

```javascript
    frontMatterTitleField: 'title',
    spellcheck: false,
    enableSmartPaste: false,
    enableMarkdownLint: false,
    customMarkdownLintConfig: DEFAULT_MARKDOWN_LINT_CONFIG,
    dateFormatISO8601: false,
    prettierConfig: `{
      "trailingComma": "es5",
      "tabWidth": 2,
      "semi": false,
      "singleQuote": true
    }`,

```
