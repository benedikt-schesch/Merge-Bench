Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the function parameters for `createEnzymeSerializer`. 

The HEAD version has:
- `classNameReplacer`
- `DOMElements = true`
- A Flow type comment `/*: Options */`

The incoming change has:
- `classNameReplacer`
- `DOMElements = true`
- `includeStyles = true` (new parameter)
- TypeScript type annotation `: Options`

The intent is clear: the incoming change wants to add a new `includeStyles` parameter with a default value of `true`, and also converts from Flow type comments to TypeScript type annotations. This is confirmed by the fact that `includeStyles` is already being used in the function body when calling `createEmotionSerializer`.

Here's the resolved conflict:

```javascript
  }
}

export function createEnzymeSerializer({
  classNameReplacer,
  DOMElements = true,
  includeStyles = true
}: Options = {}) {
  const emotionSerializer = createEmotionSerializer({
    classNameReplacer,
    DOMElements,
    includeStyles
  })

```
