Looking at this merge conflict, I can see it's a version number conflict in a UserScript header. 

The HEAD branch has version 13.15, while the incoming branch has version 13.14. Since version numbers should typically move forward and 13.15 is higher than 13.14, the semantic intent would be to keep the higher version number.

Here's the resolved snippet:
