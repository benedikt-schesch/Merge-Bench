Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add the same `knexUtils` require statement, but with slightly different formatting. The HEAD side also adds an additional `ms` module import.

The semantic intent is clear: both sides want to include the `knexUtils` module, and HEAD additionally wants the `ms` module. The only difference in the `knexUtils` line is the spacing (HEAD has no space after `const`, while the other branch has two spaces).

Here's the resolved version, keeping both imports and using consistent formatting:

```javascript
const { differenceInDays, differenceInHours, differenceInMonths, differenceInMilliseconds, addDays, subHours, subDays, subMonths, subYears } = require("date-fns");
const nanoid = require("nanoid/generate");
const JWT = require("jsonwebtoken");
const path = require("path");
const hbs = require("hbs");
const ms = require("ms");
const knexUtils = require('./knex')

const env = require("../env");

class CustomError extends Error {
  constructor(message, statusCode, data) {

```
