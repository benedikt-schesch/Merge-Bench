Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to set a value for `MAX_BTNS_PER_ROW` constant. The HEAD branch sets it to 9, while the incoming branch sets it to 7. 

Without additional context about the intent behind these different values or the requirements of the system, I cannot determine which value is semantically correct. The conflict appears to be a legitimate disagreement about what the maximum number of buttons per row should be.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
    };
    const SRCS = {
        'outlook': ['https://iframe.arkoselabs.com/B7D8911C-5CC8-A9A3-35B0-554ACEE604DA/index.html?mkt=en', false],  // Pick the penguin
        'outlook auth': ['https://iframe-auth.arkoselabs.com/B7D8911C-5CC8-A9A3-35B0-554ACEE604DA/index.html?mkt=en', false],  // Pick one square that shows two identical objects.
    };
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const MAX_BTNS_PER_ROW = 9;
=======
    const MAX_BTNS_PER_ROW = 7;
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24

    let nframes = 18;


    reset();
```
