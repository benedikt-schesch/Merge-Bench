Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to set a default value for the parameter `i` in the `on_task_ready` function. The HEAD branch wants to use 500 while the incoming branch wants to use 200. 

Without more context about what this parameter represents (likely some kind of timeout or interval in milliseconds), I cannot determine which value is semantically correct. The conflict appears to be a simple disagreement on what the default value should be.

Here's the code snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
        return $image?.src?.split(';base64,')[1];
    }


    let last_image_data = null;
<<<<<<< HEAD
    function on_task_ready(i=500) {
=======
    function on_task_ready(i=200) {
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        return new Promise(resolve => {
            let checking = false;
            const check_interval = setInterval(async () => {
                if (checking) {
                    return;

```
