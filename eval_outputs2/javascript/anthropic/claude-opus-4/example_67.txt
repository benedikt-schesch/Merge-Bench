Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to set a default value for the parameter `i` in the `on_task_ready` function. The HEAD branch wants to use 500ms while the incoming branch wants to use 200ms.

Since both changes are simply trying to adjust the same parameter (likely a timeout or interval value), and the incoming branch has a more recent/lower value (200ms would make the function more responsive), I'll resolve this by accepting the incoming change:

```javascript
        return task;
    }


    let last_urls_hash = null;
    function on_task_ready(i=200) {
        return new Promise(resolve => {
            let checking = false;
            const check_interval = setInterval(async () => {
                if (checking) {
                    return;
```
