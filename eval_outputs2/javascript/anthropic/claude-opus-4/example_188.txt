Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD** (current branch): Uses `setTimeout` with a 100ms delay before calling `wx.canvasToTempFilePath`
- **f99054b9** (incoming branch): Calls `wx.canvasToTempFilePath` immediately in the callback without any delay

Both sides agree on:
- Calling `ctx.draw(true, ...)` with a callback
- Calling `wx.canvasToTempFilePath(opt, this)` inside that callback

The semantic difference is about timing. The HEAD version introduces a 100ms delay, likely to ensure the canvas drawing is fully complete before converting to a temp file path. This is a common pattern when dealing with canvas operations that may need time to render.

Since the HEAD version includes the delay which appears to be an intentional fix for timing issues, and the incoming branch doesn't have this fix, I'll resolve in favor of HEAD's approach:

```javascript

    canvasToTempFilePath(opt) {
      if (!opt.canvasId) {
        opt.canvasId = this.data.canvasId;
      }
      
      ctx.draw(true, setTimeout( () => {
        wx.canvasToTempFilePath(opt, this);
      }, 100));
    },

    touchStart(e) {

```
