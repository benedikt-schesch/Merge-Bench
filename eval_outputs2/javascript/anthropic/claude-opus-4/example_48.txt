Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call `open_frame_token` with different arguments:

- HEAD wants to call `open_frame_token('imvu', 0, nframes);`
- The incoming change wants to call `open_frame_token('twitter', 0, nframes);`

Without more context about the intent, I cannot determine which one should be used or if both should be included. The conflict appears to be about which service/frame to open. Since the intent is ambiguous, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact:

```javascript


    reset();
    // open_all();
    // open_frame_token('ea signup', 0, nframes);
<<<<<<< HEAD
    // open_frame_token('twitter', 0, nframes);
    open_frame_token('imvu', 0, nframes);
=======
    open_frame_token('twitter', 0, nframes);

    function reset() {
        document.body.innerHTML = '';


```
