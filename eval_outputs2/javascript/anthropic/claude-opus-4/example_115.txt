Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to set the `default_tool` constant, but with different approaches:

- HEAD is using `get_tool_by_name("Pencil")` and also adds a `valid_scrollwheel_magnification` array
- The incoming change uses `get_tool_by_id(TOOL_PENCIL)`

Both sides have the same intent - to set the default tool to Pencil. The difference is in the method used (by name vs by ID). Without more context about which approach is preferred in the codebase, and since HEAD also includes an additional constant that seems unrelated to the tool selection, the safest approach is to preserve both the new constant from HEAD and choose one of the tool initialization methods.

Since using an ID constant (`TOOL_PENCIL`) is generally more maintainable than a string literal, I'll resolve by keeping the `valid_scrollwheel_magnification` from HEAD and the tool initialization from the incoming change:

```javascript

const default_magnification = 1;
const valid_scrollwheel_magnification = [0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
const default_tool = get_tool_by_id(TOOL_PENCIL);

const default_canvas_width = 683;
const default_canvas_height = 384;
let my_canvas_width = default_canvas_width;
let my_canvas_height = default_canvas_height;

```
