Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Has the import statements and then directly defines the `Managers` type
- Incoming change: Adds a `StaticStyles` type definition before the `Managers` type

Both sides seem to want to keep the `Managers` type definition. The incoming change is simply adding an additional type definition (`StaticStyles`) that doesn't conflict with anything else in the code.

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Keep all the existing imports and type definitions
2. Add the new `StaticStyles` type definition

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
// @flow
import type {StyleSheetFactoryOptions, Jss, SheetsRegistry, SheetsManager, BaseRule} from 'jss'
import type {Node} from 'react'
import type {Theming} from 'theming'

export type StaticStyles = {[key: string]: {}}

export type Managers = {[key: number]: SheetsManager}

type StyleSheetOptions = {
  ...StyleSheetFactoryOptions,
  classNamePrefix: string

```
