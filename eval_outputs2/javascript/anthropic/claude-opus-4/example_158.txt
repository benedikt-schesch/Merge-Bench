Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they want to use a local image file when running on localhost, but differ in how they construct the local path.

- HEAD uses: `"images/kolibri.img"`
- The other branch uses: `HOST + "kolibri.img"`

Since `HOST` is likely a variable that contains the base URL/path (possibly including "images/"), and both sides are trying to reference the same local kolibri.img file, I'll resolve this by keeping the approach from the branch that uses the `HOST` variable, as it's more consistent with using a configurable base path.

```javascript
            },
            {
                id: "kolibrios",
                fda: {
                    "url": ON_LOCALHOST ?
                            HOST + "kolibri.img" :
                            "//builds.kolibrios.org/eng/data/data/kolibri.img",
                    "size": 1474560,
                    "async": false,
                },
                name: "KolibriOS",
```
