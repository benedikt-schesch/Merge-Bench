Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the result of some calculated parameters `[scaling, rotation, translateX, translateY]`, but with different approaches:

- HEAD wants to return the array directly
- The incoming change wants to pass the array to a callback function

Based on the context and common patterns in JavaScript, the callback approach (from the incoming change) appears to be the more appropriate solution, especially given that this seems to be part of an asynchronous or event-driven system where callbacks are typical.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
				currentParameters[3] = translateY;
			}

			currentPositions = calculatePositions(currentParameters, true);

			callback([scaling, rotation, translateX, translateY]);
		}

		// draw a parametrized line on a canvas
		var drawPath = function(canvasContext, path, dp) {
			canvasContext.beginPath();

```
