Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the `window.WEBPACK_ASSETS` object. The only difference between the two versions is in the hash values for the `index.js` assets:

- HEAD version: `index@e45a4de49431db58f52c.js` and `index@e45a4de49431db58f52c.css`
- Incoming version: `index@8202947f0c05ff5e96d8.js` and `index@8202947f0c05ff5e96d8.css`

All other assets (`lib`, `lib2`, `lib3`, and `manifest`) have identical hashes in both versions.

This appears to be a typical webpack build output conflict where different builds have generated different content hashes for the index files. Since webpack hashes are based on file content, the incoming change (from the other branch) likely represents a more recent build with updated index file content.

In webpack asset manifests, you typically want the most recent build output. Therefore, I'll resolve this by accepting the incoming change:

```javascript
window.WEBPACK_ASSETS = {"index.js":{"js":"index@8202947f0c05ff5e96d8.js","css":"index@8202947f0c05ff5e96d8.css"},"lib":{"js":"lib@aaed0f9bfcc4ff921c5a.js"},"lib2":{"js":"lib2@819909a89ca45b94d9bf.js"},"lib3":{"js":"lib3@93b22d7460620277a5da.js"},"manifest":{"js":"manifest@f2f4bd774d6c221b3d5f.js"}}

```
