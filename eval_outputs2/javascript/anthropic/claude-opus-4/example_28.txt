Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to access a cache to check for a hit, but they're using different cache variable names:
- HEAD uses `pageCache`
- The incoming change uses `microCache`

Without additional context about which cache variable is actually defined and intended to be used in this codebase, I cannot determine which is semantically correct. The conflict appears to be a naming disagreement rather than a functional one.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
    }
  }

  const cacheable = isCacheable(req)
  if (cacheable) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    const hit = pageCache.get(req.url)
=======
    const hit = microCache.get(req.url)
>>>>>>> f0b94b1bb40e96943a88b9fca597fd22c8741c34
    if (hit) {
      if (!isProd) {
        console.log(`cache hit!`)
      }
      return res.end(hit)

```
