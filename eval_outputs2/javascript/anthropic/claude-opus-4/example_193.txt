Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the function parameters for `createSerializer`. 

The HEAD version adds a flow type comment `/*: Options */` after the parameter object, while the other branch adds a new parameter `includeStyles = true` and uses TypeScript syntax `: Options` for type annotation.

Since both changes appear to be intentional improvements (one adding type information and the other adding a new parameter), the semantic intent is to have both the new parameter and proper type annotation. Given that the second branch uses TypeScript syntax (`: Options`) rather than Flow syntax (`/*: Options */`), and it's more complete with the additional parameter, I'll resolve by keeping the more complete version:

```javascript
  }
}

export function createSerializer({
  classNameReplacer,
  DOMElements = true,
  includeStyles = true
}: Options = {}) {
  const cache = new WeakSet()
  const isTransformed = val => cache.has(val)

  function serialize(
    val,

```
