Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update a settings value, but they're using different function names to do so:

- HEAD uses: `BG.exec('Settings.set', ...)`
- The incoming change uses: `BG.exec('set_settings', ...)`

Without more context about which API is currently correct in the codebase, I cannot determine which one should be used. The intent is the same (saving a setting), but the function name differs. This requires knowledge of the current API structure to resolve properly.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript

    function on_click(event) {
        // Save the selected element
        const $e = event.target;
        const selector = nopecha_selector.get_css($e);
<<<<<<< HEAD
        BG.exec('Settings.set', {id: nopecha_selector.locate, value: selector});
=======
        BG.exec('set_settings', {id: nopecha_selector.locate, value: selector});
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        stop(true);
    }

    function on_mousemove(event) {
        // Update highlight overlay when new element is targeted

```
