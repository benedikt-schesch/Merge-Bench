Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different require statements after the base configuration import:

- HEAD wants to add: `const HTMLPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')`
- The other branch wants to add: `const vueConfig = require('./vue-loader.config')`

Since these are two different imports that serve different purposes (HTMLPlugin for HTML generation and vueConfig for Vue loader configuration), and they don't conflict with each other semantically, the resolution should include both imports.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack')
const merge = require('webpack-merge')
const base = require('./webpack.base.config')
const HTMLPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')
const vueConfig = require('./vue-loader.config')
const SWPrecachePlugin = require('sw-precache-webpack-plugin')
const VueSSRClientPlugin = require('vue-server-renderer/client-plugin')

const config = merge(base, {
  entry: {

```
