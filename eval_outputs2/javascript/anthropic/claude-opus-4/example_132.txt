Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - they have identical code but with different indentation. The HEAD version uses tabs while the other branch uses spaces for indentation.

Since both versions have the exact same logic and the only difference is whitespace, I'll preserve the HEAD version's indentation to maintain consistency with the surrounding code (which appears to use tabs based on the context).

```javascript

			// Update motion

			var pos = this.turn('calculateZ', d.pageMv), view = this.turn('view', d.tpage), apage;

			if (d.pagePlace[view[0]]==view[0]) apage = view[0];
			else if (d.pagePlace[view[1]]==view[1]) apage = view[1];

        	for (p = 1; p <= d.totalPages; p++) { 

        		d.pageWrap[p].css({display: (pos.pageV[p]) ? '' : 'none', 'z-index': pos.pageZ[p] || 0});
        		d.pages[p].flip('z', pos.partZ[p] || null);

```
