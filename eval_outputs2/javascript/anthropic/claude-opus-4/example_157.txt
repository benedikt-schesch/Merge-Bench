Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to close what appears to be a function or method definition, but they're using different syntax:

- HEAD uses `}` (without semicolon)
- The incoming change uses `};` (with semicolon)

The presence of `this.fs.Check()` suggests this is likely a method within a class or an object method. In JavaScript, whether to use a semicolon after a closing brace depends on the context:
- For regular function declarations or methods within a class: no semicolon needed
- For object methods or function expressions assigned to variables: semicolon is typically used

Without seeing more context about whether this is a class method, object method, or function expression, I cannot determine which approach is semantically correct. Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
            break;
    }

    //consistency checks if there are problems with the filesystem
    //this.fs.Check();
<<<<<<< HEAD
}
