Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the `track` function but with different intentions:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Adds an event dispatch mechanism before tracking begins, creating and dispatching a "clmtrackrBeforeTrack" event. The function signature remains `function(element, box)`.

- **Right side**: Changes the function signature to include a third parameter `gi`, making it `function(element, box, gi)`.

Both changes appear to be independent improvements that can be combined. The HEAD side adds functionality (event dispatching) while the right side extends the function signature. These changes don't conflict semantically.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript

		/*
		 *  element : canvas or video element
		 *  TODO: should be able to take img element as well
		 */
		this.track = function(element, box, gi) {

			var evt = document.createEvent("Event");
			evt.initEvent("clmtrackrBeforeTrack", true, true);
			document.dispatchEvent(evt)

			var scaling, translateX, translateY, rotation;
			var croppedPatches = [];
			var ptch, px, py;
