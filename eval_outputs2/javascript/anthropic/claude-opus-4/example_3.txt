Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Has no empty line between the closing brace `}` and the function declaration
- The incoming change (48426836b34aa1659dc4fc453179ef7ce7f19dfa): Adds an empty line between the closing brace and the function declaration

This appears to be a formatting/style conflict. The incoming change is adding spacing for better code readability by separating the end of one function from the beginning of another. This is a common code style practice to improve readability.

Since the intent seems to be improving code formatting and readability, I'll resolve in favor of the incoming change that adds the empty line:

```javascript
        : selectedValue
    } else {
      return null
    }
  }

function validateRequestBodyIsRequired(selector) {
  return (...args) =>
    (system) => {
      const specJson = system.getSystem().specSelectors.specJson()

```
