Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

**HEAD side:**
- Exports a default export from './withStyles'
- Also exports a named export 'styled' from './styled'

**Other side (dae1bf2b42e46270f3625b5d1dabaccea2aeda17):**
- Exports 'withStyles' as a named export
- Also exports 'withStyles' as the default export
- Includes a comment indicating this is for backwards compatibility

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to export withStyles functionality
- The other side explicitly wants to maintain backwards compatibility by providing both named and default exports
- HEAD side also wants to export 'styled' functionality

The resolution should preserve both the backwards compatibility pattern and include the styled export:

```javascript
export {default as createUseStyles} from './createUseStyles'
export {default as JssProvider} from './JssProvider'
export {default as jss} from './jss'
export {SheetsRegistry, createGenerateId} from 'jss'
export {default as JssContext} from './JssContext'
export {default as withStyles} from './withStyles'
export {default as styled} from './styled'

// Kept for backwards compatibility.
export default withStyles

```
