Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - creating a spy function and setting up a Vue component. The key differences are:

1. **HEAD** uses `jasmine.createSpy()` and `mount(store, {`
2. **ce0c88a** uses `jest.fn()` and `new Vue({`

Based on the context, it appears the codebase is transitioning from Jasmine to Jest for testing (a common migration pattern). The incoming change (ce0c88a) is updating the test to use Jest's spy function and Vue's constructor directly.

Here's the resolved conflict, preserving the Jest migration:

```javascript
          expect(getters.count).toBe(value)
        }
      }
    })

    const spy = jest.fn()
    const vm = new Vue({
      computed: {
        a: () => store.getters.count
      },
      watch: {
        a: spy

```
