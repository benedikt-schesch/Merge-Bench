Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

1. **HEAD (current branch)**: Has the basic setup with `int`, `precision`, and `thousands` variables
2. **Incoming change**: Adds a new variable `leadingCount` that counts the number of zeros in the format string before any comma or decimal point

The semantic intent appears to be:
- The current branch has the existing functionality
- The incoming change is adding a new feature to count leading zeros in the format pattern

Since both changes are additive and don't conflict in their intent (the new line is just adding a new variable calculation), the resolution should include both. The incoming change appears to be a feature addition that doesn't break or modify the existing code.

```javascript

            // break number and format
            int = value.toString().split('.')[0];
            precision = format.split('.')[1];
            thousands = format.indexOf(',');
            leadingCount = (format.split('.')[0].split(',')[0].match(/0/g) || []).length;

            if (precision) {
                if (numeral._.includes(precision, '[')) {
                    precision = precision.replace(']', '');
                    precision = precision.split('[');

```
