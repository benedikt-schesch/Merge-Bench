Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the VERSION constant, but with different version numbers:
- HEAD (current branch): VERSION = '2.0.4'
- Incoming branch: VERSION = '2.0.5'

Since this appears to be a version number update, and the incoming branch has a higher version number (2.0.5 > 2.0.4), the semantic intent is likely to use the newer version. This is a common pattern in software development where version numbers are incremented.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
        Variables
    ************************************/

    var numeral,
        _,
        VERSION = '2.0.5',
        formats = {},
        locales = {},
        defaults = {
            currentLocale: 'en',
            zeroFormat: null,
```
