Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to get the current timestamp in milliseconds:

- The HEAD version uses `new Date().getTime()`
- The incoming version uses `Date.now()`

Both achieve the same result - getting the current timestamp in milliseconds. However, `Date.now()` is the more modern and performant approach as it:
1. Doesn't create a new Date object (less memory allocation)
2. Is more concise
3. Is the recommended modern JavaScript approach

Since both have the same intent but the incoming change represents a code improvement, I'll resolve in favor of the more modern approach:

```javascript

    this.valueRange = { min: chartMinValue, max: chartMaxValue };
  };

  SmoothieChart.prototype.render = function(canvas, time) {
    var nowMillis = Date.now();

    // Respect any frame rate limit.
    if (this.options.limitFPS > 0 && nowMillis - this.lastRenderTimeMillis < (1000/this.options.limitFPS))
      return;


```
