Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the template version number:
- HEAD has version 1.1.3
- The incoming change has version 1.2.0

Since version 1.2.0 is newer than 1.1.3, the semantic intent appears to be updating to the latest version. The conflict arose because both branches modified the same version comment line.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript

'use strict'
// Template version: 1.2.0
// see http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack for documentation.

const path = require('path')

module.exports = {

```
