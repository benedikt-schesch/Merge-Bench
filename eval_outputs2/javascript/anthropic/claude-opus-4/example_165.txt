Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Registers read handlers for both ports 0x3D4 and 0x3D5 with simple function references
- **Right side**: Only registers a read handler for port 0x3D5, but with an additional 16-bit read handler that logs a warning

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to handle reads from port 0x3D5
- The right side adds special handling for 16-bit reads with a warning
- HEAD also wants to handle reads from port 0x3D4 (which the right side doesn't explicitly register)

The resolution should include both ports (0x3D4 and 0x3D5) and preserve the 16-bit read warning functionality for port 0x3D5:

```javascript
    io.register_read(0x3C9, this, this.port3C9_read);

    io.register_read(0x3CC, this, this.port3CC_read);

    io.register_write_consecutive(0x3D4, this, this.port3D4_write, this.port3D5_write);
    io.register_read(0x3D4, this, this.port3D4_read);
    io.register_read(0x3D5, this, this.port3D5_read, () => {
        dbg_log("Warning: 16-bit read from 3D5", LOG_VGA);
        return this.port3D5_read();
    });

    io.register_read(0x3CA, this, function() { dbg_log("3CA read", LOG_VGA); return 0; });

    io.register_read(0x3DA, this, this.port3DA_read);
    io.register_read(0x3BA, this, this.port3DA_read);

```
