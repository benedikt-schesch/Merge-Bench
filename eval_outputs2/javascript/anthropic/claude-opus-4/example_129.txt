Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to set up the canvas after setting its dimensions. The key difference is that the branch `a31c2d2872b28551b1b1984bb610d0efa4733b05` adds a call to `ctx.disable_image_smoothing();` before filling the background.

The intent appears to be:
- HEAD: Just set canvas dimensions and fill background
- Branch: Set canvas dimensions, disable image smoothing, then fill background

Since disabling image smoothing is a specific enhancement that doesn't conflict with the basic setup, the semantic resolution should include both changes - the canvas setup AND the image smoothing configuration.

```javascript
	undos = [];
	redos = [];

	canvas.width = my_canvas_width;
	canvas.height = my_canvas_height;
	ctx.disable_image_smoothing();
	
	ctx.fillStyle = colors.background;
	ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

	$canvas_area.trigger("resize");
}

```
