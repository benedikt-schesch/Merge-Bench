Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same goal - getting the current timestamp to pass to the callback function. The conflict is purely about the implementation approach:

- `HEAD` uses `new Date().getTime()`
- The other branch uses `Date.now()`

Both methods return the same value (current timestamp in milliseconds since Unix epoch). `Date.now()` is more modern, concise, and slightly more performant since it doesn't create a Date object. Since the intent is identical and `Date.now()` is the better approach, I'll resolve with that version:

```javascript
            window.mozRequestAnimationFrame     ||
            window.oRequestAnimationFrame       ||
            window.msRequestAnimationFrame      ||
            function(callback) {
              return window.setTimeout(function() {
                callback(Date.now());
              }, 16);
            };
          return requestAnimationFrame.call(window, callback, element);
        },
        cancelAnimationFrame = function(id) {
```
