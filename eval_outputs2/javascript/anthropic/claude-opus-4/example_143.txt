Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

**HEAD (Current branch):**
- Clears cache variables: `d.cachedCharWidth`, `d.cachedTextHeight`, `knownScrollbarWidth`
- Calls `cm.setSize()`

**Incoming changes:**
- Clears cache variables: `d.cachedCharWidth`, `d.cachedTextHeight`, `d.cachedPaddingH`, `knownScrollbarWidth`
- Calls `clearCaches(cm)`
- Runs `regChange` in an operation context with `runInOp`

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to clear cached values when resizing
2. The incoming change is more comprehensive:
   - It adds `d.cachedPaddingH` to the list of cleared caches
   - It uses `clearCaches(cm)` which likely clears additional caches beyond just the ones listed
   - It ensures the change is registered properly with `runInOp(cm, bind(regChange, cm))`

The incoming changes seem to be a more complete solution that handles the resize event more thoroughly. It not only clears more caches but also properly registers the change within the editor's operation system.

```javascript
    var resizeTimer;
    function onResize() {
      if (resizeTimer == null) resizeTimer = setTimeout(function() {
        resizeTimer = null;
        // Might be a text scaling operation, clear size caches.
        d.cachedCharWidth = d.cachedTextHeight = d.cachedPaddingH = knownScrollbarWidth = null;
        clearCaches(cm);
        runInOp(cm, bind(regChange, cm));
      }, 100);
    }
    on(window, "resize", onResize);
    // The above handler holds on to the editor and its data
    // structures. Here we poll to unregister it when the editor is no
```
