Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD** wants to add `extendRefs: 'fail'` to the ajv validator configuration
- **The incoming change** wants to add `strict: false` with a FIXME comment referencing a Vega issue

Both changes appear to be adding different configuration options to the same ajv validator instance. Since these are different properties that serve different purposes:
- `extendRefs: 'fail'` controls how JSON Schema reference extensions are handled
- `strict: false` disables strict mode validation (with a note that this is a temporary fix)

The semantic intent seems to be that both configuration options should be included, as they address different aspects of the validator's behavior.

```javascript
const res = './test/resources/';

const validator = new ajv.default({
    allErrors: true,
    verbose: true,
    extendRefs: 'fail',
    strict: false // FIXME: https://github.com/vega/vega/issues/3022
  });

addFormats(validator);

const validate = validator.compile(schema);

```
