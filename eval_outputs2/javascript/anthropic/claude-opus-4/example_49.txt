Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to get URL information from a background script, but they're using different method names:

- HEAD side: `BG.exec('Tab.info')`
- Other side: `BG.exec('info_tab')`

Without more context about which is the correct API or whether this is a refactoring where the method name was changed, I cannot determine which one should be used. The semantic intent is the same (getting tab/URL information), but the specific method name differs.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript

    async function on_click(index) {
        const task = get_task();
        const image = get_image();
        if (task && image) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            const url = (await BG.exec('Tab.info'))?.url;
=======
            const url = (await BG.exec('info_tab'))?.url;
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
            const data = {task, image, index, url};

            if (SUBMISSION_STRATEGY.startsWith('l')) {
                window.parent.postMessage({nopecha: true, action: 'append', data: data}, '*');
            }

```
