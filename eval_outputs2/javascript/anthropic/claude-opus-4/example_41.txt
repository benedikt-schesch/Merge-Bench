Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to set the `proxyIPs` array with different proxy addresses. The HEAD version uses "workers.cloudflare.cyou" while the incoming change uses "proxy.xxxxxxxx.tk". 

Both sides also include similar lists of alternative proxy addresses in their comments, with the incoming change having a slightly longer list that includes all the addresses from HEAD plus "proxy.xxxxxxxx.tk".

Since I cannot determine which proxy address should be preferred without more context about the intent (whether "workers.cloudflare.cyou" or "proxy.xxxxxxxx.tk" is the correct proxy to use), I'll return the code with the conflict markers intact:

```javascript

// How to generate your own UUID:
// [Windows] Press "Win + R", input cmd and run:  Powershell -NoExit -Command "[guid]::NewGuid()"
let userID = "5db5edff-54dd-4ffa-b001-b1991d722308";
