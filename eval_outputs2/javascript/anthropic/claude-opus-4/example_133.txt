Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the only difference between the two versions is the presence of a blank line after the `if (d.opt.frontShadow)` block and before the `if (d.opt.backShadow)` block.

The HEAD version has this blank line for better readability and separation between the two conditional blocks, while the other branch removed it. Since this is purely a formatting difference with no semantic changes, and having the blank line improves code readability by visually separating the two related but distinct operations, I'll preserve the blank line from the HEAD version.

```javascript

				if (d.opt.frontShadow)
					d.ashadow.css({'background-image':
									'-webkit-gradient(linear, ' + (left?100:0)+'% '+(top?100:0)+'%, ' + gradientEndPointA.x + '% ' + gradientEndPointA.y + '%, color-stop(' + gradientStartV + ',rgba(0,0,0,0)), color-stop(' + (((1-gradientStartV)*0.8)+gradientStartV) + ',rgba(0,0,0,'+(0.2*gradientOpacity)+')), to(rgba(255,255,255,'+(0.2*gradientOpacity)+')) )'});
			
		
				if (d.opt.backShadow)
					d.bshadow.css({'background-image': 
									'-webkit-gradient(linear, ' + (left?0:100)+'% '+(top?0:100)+'%, ' + gradientEndPointB.x + '% ' + gradientEndPointB.y + '%,  color-stop(0.8,rgba(0,0,0,0)), color-stop(1, rgba(0,0,0,'+(0.2*gradientOpacity)+')), to(rgba(0,0,0,0)) )'});

			};
