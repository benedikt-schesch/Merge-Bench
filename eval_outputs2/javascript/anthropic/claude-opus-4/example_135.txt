Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has added a new function `onHiddenSSIDChange` that follows the same pattern as the other setting change handlers (`onPortraitChange` and `onHidePasswordChange`). The other branch (df6d62c397992aef26c3abb26ad667bcbc7184ad) doesn't have this addition.

Since the new function follows the established pattern and appears to be intentionally added to handle a `hiddenSSID` setting (consistent with the naming convention and implementation pattern), the semantic intent seems clear - to add support for managing a hidden SSID setting.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
    setSettings({ ...settings, portrait });
  };
  const onHidePasswordChange = (hidePassword) => {
    setSettings({ ...settings, hidePassword });
  };
  const onHiddenSSIDChange = (hiddenSSID) => {
    setSettings({ ...settings, hiddenSSID });
  };
  const onFirstLoad = () => {
    html.style.direction = htmlDirection();
    firstLoad.current = false;
  };


```
