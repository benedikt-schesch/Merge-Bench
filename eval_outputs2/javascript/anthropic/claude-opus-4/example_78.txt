Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to modify the `renderWeek` function, with the key difference being the `firstWeekOfYearMinDays` parameter.

The **HEAD** version:
- Adds a `firstWeekOfYearMinDays` parameter to the function
- Passes this parameter to the `isoWeek` function
- Uses consistent formatting with semicolon placement

The **incoming** version:
- Keeps the original function signature without the extra parameter
- Calls `isoWeek` without the additional parameter
- Uses slightly different formatting

From a semantic perspective, the HEAD version appears to be adding functionality to support configurable first week calculations (likely for different locale requirements), while the incoming version maintains the original behavior. The HEAD version seems to be the more feature-complete implementation.

Here's the resolved conflict, preserving the HEAD version's functionality:

```javascript
            weekNum     = 1 + Math.round((daysBetween - dayShift + prevWeekDay(jan4th.getDay())) / daysPerWeek);

        return weekNum;
    },

    renderWeek = function (d, m, y, firstWeekOfYearMinDays) {
        var date = new Date(y, m, d)
          , week = hasMoment ? moment(date).isoWeek() : isoWeek(date, firstWeekOfYearMinDays)
        ;

        return '<td class="pika-week">' + week + '</td>';
    },

    renderRow = function(days, isRTL, pickWholeWeek, isRowSelected)
```
