Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import necessary dependencies for a Vuex test file. The conflict appears to be between two different versions of Vue:

- HEAD (current branch): Uses Vue 3 style import with `import { nextTick } from 'vue'`
- The other branch: Uses Vue 2 style import with `import Vue from 'vue'`

Since this is a test file for Vuex and both sides need Vue functionality, but the actual usage in the test would determine which import is needed. Without seeing how Vue/nextTick is used in the rest of the test file, I cannot definitively resolve this conflict as the intent depends on which version of Vue the codebase is using.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
import { nextTick } from 'vue'
=======
import Vue from 'vue'
>>>>>>> ce0c88a81703017cad63e4b5a913eff6349f585a
import Vuex from '../../src/index'

const TEST = 'TEST'

describe('Modules', () => {
