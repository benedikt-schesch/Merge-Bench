Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides of the merge are trying to achieve the same result - they both want to remove what appears to be an extra blank line between the closing brace `}` and the comment `/**`. 

The HEAD version has one blank line, while the other branch has no blank lines. Since both changes are moving in the same direction (reducing whitespace) and the more minimal version with no blank lines is cleaner, I'll resolve this by accepting the version with no blank lines:

```javascript
            });
        }
    }

    /**
     * Locate element
     */

    for (const $e of document.querySelectorAll('.locate')) {
```
