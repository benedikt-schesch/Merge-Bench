Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to get settings from the background script, but they're using different method names:

- HEAD uses: `BG.exec('Settings.get')`
- The incoming change uses: `BG.exec('get_settings')`

Without more context about which method name is correct in the codebase, I cannot determine which one should be used. The intent is the same (retrieving settings), but the implementation differs.

Here's the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
        }

        // Wait for task to be available
        const {task, is_hard, cells, background_url, urls} = await on_task_ready();

<<<<<<< HEAD
        const settings = await BG.exec('Settings.get');
=======
        const settings = await BG.exec('get_settings');
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        if (!settings.enabled || !settings.recaptcha_auto_solve) {
            return;
        }

        const n = cells.length == 9 ? 3 : 4;

```
