Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle imports, but with different approaches:

- HEAD side: Has a commented-out import type statement
- Other side: Has an actual import for `prefixer` and an uncommented import type statement

The semantic intent appears to be that the other side is adding the prefixer import and keeping the type import active, while HEAD had commented out the type import (possibly temporarily).

Since the other side has both a new functional import (`prefixer`) and the type import uncommented, and this seems to be the more complete implementation, I'll resolve in favor of the other side:

```javascript
  compat,
  removeLabel,
  createUnsafeSelectorsAlarm,
  incorrectImportAlarm
} from './stylis-plugins'
import { prefixer } from './prefixer'
import type { StylisPlugin } from './types'

let isBrowser = typeof document !== 'undefined'

/*
export type Options = {

```
