Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD version does not include the `log.js` import, while the incoming change adds it. Without knowing the full context of how `log` is used in the rest of the file, I cannot determine whether this import is necessary or not. The conflict might exist because:

1. The HEAD version might have removed the log import because it's no longer needed
2. The incoming change might have added it because new code requires it
3. There might be different approaches to logging between the two branches

Since I cannot determine the intent without seeing how `log` is used in the rest of the file, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```javascript
 * robust as jquery's, so there's probably some differences.
 */

import * as Dom from './dom.js';
import * as Guid from './guid.js';
