Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve similar improvements to the code, with some differences in approach:

**HEAD side:**
- Uses `let` for the query variable
- Directly calls `normalizeMatch(match)` inline within `Object.entries()`

**Other side (ea888dcb):**
- Extracts `normalizeMatch(match)` into a separate `const` variable for clarity
- Uses `const` for the query variable (which is better practice since it's not reassigned)
- Adds an empty line for better readability

Both sides maintain the same functionality, but the other side has better code quality practices. Here's the resolved version that combines the best of both:

```javascript

  return newMatch;
}

async function total(match, params) {
  const normalizedMatch = normalizeMatch(match);
  const query = knex("links");
  
  Object.entries(normalizedMatch).forEach(([key, value]) => {
    query.andWhere(key, ...(Array.isArray(value) ? value : [value]));
  });

  if (params?.search) {
    query.andWhereRaw(

```
