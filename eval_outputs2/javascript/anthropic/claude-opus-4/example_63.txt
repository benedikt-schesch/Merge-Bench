Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- The HEAD branch (current branch) has removed some commented-out code
- The incoming branch (a9ce98f97...) has this code commented out

The semantic intent appears to be that both sides want this code removed or disabled:
- HEAD completely removed it
- The other branch commented it out (likely as an intermediate step before removal)

Since both sides agree the code should not be active, and HEAD has taken the cleaner approach of complete removal, I'll resolve in favor of HEAD by removing the commented code entirely.

```javascript
    }
    else {
        document.querySelector('#export').classList.add('hidden');
    }

    /**
     * Tab switching
     */
