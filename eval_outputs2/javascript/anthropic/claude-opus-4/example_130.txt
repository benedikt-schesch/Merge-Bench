Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (left side)**: Simply checks if `!meta` exists before initializing the metadata
- **RIGHT side**: Checks if `!meta || !meta.codec` exists, and additionally sets audio flags before initializing

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to initialize audio metadata when it doesn't exist
- The RIGHT side adds an additional check for `!meta.codec` (suggesting metadata might exist but be incomplete)
- The RIGHT side also ensures audio flags are set to true when initializing metadata

The RIGHT side's approach seems more complete as it:
1. Handles cases where metadata exists but lacks codec information
2. Properly sets the audio flags before initialization

Here's the resolved conflict:

```javascript


        let meta = this._audioMetadata;
        let track = this._audioTrack;

        if (!meta || !meta.codec) {
            if (this._hasAudio === false) {
                this._hasAudio = true;
                this._mediaInfo.hasAudio = true;
            }

            // initial metadata
            meta = this._audioMetadata = {};
            meta.type = 'audio';
            meta.id = track.id;
            meta.timescale = this._timescale;

```
