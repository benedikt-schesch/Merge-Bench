Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- HEAD (current branch) has: `const isCacheable = req => true` - which always returns true, making every request cacheable
- The incoming change has: `const isCacheable = req => useMicroCache` - which returns the value of a `useMicroCache` variable

Based on the comment above that explains the caching behavior ("since this app has no user-specific content, every page is micro-cacheable"), and considering both sides are trying to control whether caching is enabled:

- The HEAD version implements a simple "always cache" approach
- The incoming version wants to make caching configurable via a `useMicroCache` variable

The semantic intent appears to be adding configurability to the caching behavior. The incoming change is more flexible as it allows toggling micro-caching on/off, while still supporting the "always cache" behavior when `useMicroCache` is true.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript

// since this app has no user-specific content, every page is micro-cacheable.
// if your app involves user-specific content, you need to implement custom
// logic to determine whether a request is cacheable based on its url and
// headers.
const isCacheable = req => useMicroCache

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  if (!renderer) {
    return res.end('waiting for compilation... refresh in a moment.')
  }

```
