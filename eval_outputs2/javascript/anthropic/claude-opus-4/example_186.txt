Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call a reducer initialization function, but with different function names:

- HEAD: `useEnhancedReducer`
- Incoming change: `useControlledState`

Without additional context about which function should be used or whether one was renamed to the other, I cannot determine the correct semantic intent. Both appear to be doing the same thing (initializing a reducer with the same parameters), but the function name differs.

Here is the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript

  // Reducer init.
  const [
    {isOpen, highlightedIndex, selectedItem, inputValue},
    dispatch,
<<<<<<< HEAD
  ] = useEnhancedReducer(downshiftSelectReducer, initialState, props)
=======
  ] = useControlledState(downshiftSelectReducer, initialState, props)
>>>>>>> fe0fd13be9c75b6e6834d9f712979339b2d50af8

  // Refs
  const toggleButtonRef = useRef(null)
  const menuRef = useRef(null)
  const isInitialMountRef = useRef(true)

```
