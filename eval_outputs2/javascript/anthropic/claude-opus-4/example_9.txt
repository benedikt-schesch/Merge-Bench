Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that HEAD is trying to declare an additional variable `consoleErrorMock` alongside the other test setup variables, while the other branch has just the three basic variables.

Given the context of test setup code and the variable name `consoleErrorMock`, it appears HEAD is trying to add console error mocking functionality to the test suite. This is a common pattern in testing to capture or suppress console errors during tests.

Since this seems to be an intentional addition for test infrastructure and doesn't conflict with the base functionality (just adds to it), I'll resolve by keeping the HEAD version with all four variables:

```javascript
let act, asyncAct, React, consoleErrorMock

beforeEach(() => {
  jest.resetModules()
  act = require('../pure').act
  asyncAct = require('../act-compat').asyncAct

```
