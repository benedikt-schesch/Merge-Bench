Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the `fb1750641afbb650e56669d88a5bc568544b9976` branch is trying to add a new boolean variable `gettingPosition` initialized to `false` after the `first` variable declaration.

Since this appears to be adding a new feature/functionality (tracking whether a position is being obtained) without conflicting with the existing code structure, the semantic intent seems clear - to introduce a new state variable.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
		var PDMVariance = 0.7;

		var relaxation = 0.1;

		var first = true;
		var gettingPosition = false;

		var convergenceLimit = 0.01;

		var learningRate = [];
		var stepParameter = 1.25;

```
