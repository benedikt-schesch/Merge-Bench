Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to get settings from a background service (BG), but using different method names:
- HEAD uses: `Settings.get`
- The incoming change uses: `get_settings`

Since both sides have the same intent (retrieving settings) and the conflict is only about the method name, I cannot determine which is the correct API without more context about the codebase. Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript

        if (task === null || cells === null || image_data === null) {
            return;
        }

<<<<<<< HEAD
        const settings = await BG.exec('Settings.get');
=======
        const settings = await BG.exec('get_settings');
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        if (!settings.enabled || !settings.funcaptcha_auto_solve) {
            return;
        }

        const solve_start = Time.time();

```
