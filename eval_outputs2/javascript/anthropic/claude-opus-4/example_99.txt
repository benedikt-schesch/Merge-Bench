Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to handle the `unformat` function for what appears to be percentage formatting in a numeral library.

The HEAD version simply multiplies the parsed number by 0.01 (converting percentage to decimal).

The incoming change introduces a conditional behavior based on a `scalePercentBy100` option - if this option is true, it scales by 0.01, otherwise it returns the number as-is.

The semantic intent appears to be adding configurability to how percentages are handled during unformatting. The incoming change is more flexible and backward-compatible (when `scalePercentBy100` is true, it behaves exactly like HEAD).

Here's the resolved version:

```javascript
            }

            return output;
        },
        unformat: function(string) {
            var number = numeral._.stringToNumber(string);
            if (numeral.options.scalePercentBy100) {
                return number * 0.01;
            }
            return number;
        }
    });
})();
