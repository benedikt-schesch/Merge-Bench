Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the import path for `createStateLink`. The conflict is in a commented-out line, where:

- HEAD (current branch) has: `// import { createStateLink } from '../../modules/apollo-common';`
- The incoming change has: `// import { createStateLink } from '../../modules/apollo-common/links/state.js';`

The incoming change appears to be making the import path more specific by adding `/links/state.js` to the end, which is likely a refactoring to be more explicit about the file location.

Since both sides are keeping the line commented out and the incoming change has a more specific/complete path, I'll resolve by keeping the more specific version:

```javascript

import { SchemaLink } from '@apollo/client/link/schema';
import { GraphQLSchema } from '../graphql/index.js';

// import { createStateLink } from '../../modules/apollo-common/links/state.js';
import { ApolloLink } from 'apollo-link';

import { getFragmentMatcher } from '../../modules/fragment_matcher';
