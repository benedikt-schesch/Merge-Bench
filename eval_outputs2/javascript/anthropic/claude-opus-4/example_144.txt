Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand the intent of both sides:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Adds a `leftButtonDown` function that checks if the CodeMirror instance is focused, and if not, calls `onFocus(cm)`. It also declares `lastClick` and `lastDoubleClick` variables.

- **Incoming change**: Adds a `setTimeout` that calls `ensureFocus` on the CodeMirror instance with a 0ms delay.

Both sides are trying to ensure the CodeMirror instance has focus, but using different approaches:
- HEAD uses an immediate synchronous check and focus
- The incoming change uses an asynchronous approach with `setTimeout`

The semantic intent is the same - ensure focus on the editor. Since the HEAD version includes the function definition and variable declarations that are needed for the click handling logic that follows, and both approaches achieve the same goal of ensuring focus, I'll keep the HEAD version as it provides a more complete implementation.

```javascript
      if (captureRightClick) onContextMenu(cm, e);
      break;
    }
  }

  var lastClick, lastDoubleClick;
  function leftButtonDown(cm, e, start) {
    if (!cm.state.focused) onFocus(cm);

    var now = +new Date, type;
    if (lastDoubleClick && lastDoubleClick.time > now - 400 && cmp(lastDoubleClick.pos, start) == 0) {
      type = "triple";
    } else if (lastClick && lastClick.time > now - 400 && cmp(lastClick.pos, start) == 0) {

```
