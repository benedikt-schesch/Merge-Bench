Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the timestamp in the header comment of what appears to be a Chinese script file (likely for iQIYI member sign-in). 

The HEAD branch has an older date (2021.12.4) while the incoming branch has a newer date (2022.1.24). Since this appears to be an update timestamp, the semantic intent would be to keep the most recent date.

Here's the resolved version:
