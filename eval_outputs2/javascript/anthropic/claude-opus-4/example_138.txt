Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update version information for the same library (leon-sans.com). 

The HEAD branch has:
- VERSION: 1.6.3
- DATE: 2019-09-13

The other branch has:
- VERSION: 1.6.1
- DATE: 2019-09-05

Since 1.6.3 is a newer version than 1.6.1, and the date 2019-09-13 is more recent than 2019-09-05, the intent appears to be updating to the latest version. The HEAD branch contains the more recent updates.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
/*!
 * VERSION: 1.6.3
 * DATE: 2019-09-13
 * https://leon-sans.com

 * @license Copyright (c) 2019, Jongmin Kim. All rights reserved.
