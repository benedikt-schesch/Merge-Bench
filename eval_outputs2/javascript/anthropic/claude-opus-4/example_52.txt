Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to retrieve settings from a background service (BG), but using different method names:
- HEAD uses: `'Settings.get'`
- The incoming change uses: `'get_settings'`

Without additional context about which method name is correct or what the background service expects, I cannot determine which one should be used. The conflict appears to be a naming convention difference that requires knowledge of the actual API.

```javascript


    while (true) {
        await Time.sleep(1000);

<<<<<<< HEAD
        const settings = await BG.exec('Settings.get');
=======
        const settings = await BG.exec('get_settings');
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
        if (!settings || !settings.enabled) {
            continue;
        }

        const hostname = await Location.hostname();

```
