Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that:

- The HEAD version has no content between the opening of the async function and the `is_widget_frame()` function definition
- The incoming change (07dbd1e26d1216651e65a3147e9c3171dce485de) adds a blank line between the opening of the async function and the `is_widget_frame()` function definition

This is a trivial formatting conflict where one side added a blank line. Since this is just a stylistic difference with no semantic impact, I'll resolve it by keeping the blank line as it can improve readability:

```javascript
(async () => {

    function is_widget_frame() {
        return document.querySelector('div.check') !== null;
    }
