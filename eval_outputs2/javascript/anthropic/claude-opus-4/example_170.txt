Looking at this merge conflict, I can see both sides are trying to reset state before each test, but they're using different approaches:

- HEAD side: Directly resets `moduleId.default = 0`
- Other side: Calls two functions `resetSheets()` and `resetModuleId()`

The semantic intent of both sides is clearly to reset the test state. The other side appears to be a more comprehensive refactoring that extracts the reset logic into dedicated functions and also adds sheet resetting. Since both sides want to achieve the same goal (resetting state) and the other side seems to be a more complete solution, I'll resolve by keeping the other side's approach:

```javascript
  }
}

describe('Unit: jss - createGenerateId', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    resetSheets()
    resetModuleId()
  })

  it('should return a function', () => {
    expect(createGenerateId()).to.be.a(Function)
  })

```
