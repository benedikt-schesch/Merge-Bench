Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the same file, but with two key differences:

1. HEAD has a typo: `'use stxrict'` instead of `'use strict'`
2. The template versions differ: 1.1.0 vs 1.1.1

The semantic intent appears to be:
- Both sides want to use strict mode
- The branch (53e2118...) has the correct spelling and a newer template version

The resolution should fix the typo and use the newer template version:

```javascript
'use strict'
// Template version: 1.1.1
// see http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack for documentation.

const path = require('path')

module.exports = {

```
