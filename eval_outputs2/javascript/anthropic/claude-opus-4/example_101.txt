Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define properties in an `options` object. The HEAD branch has the base properties, while the incoming branch is adding an additional property `scalePercentBy100`.

Since both sides share the same base properties and the conflict is simply about adding a new property, the semantic intent is clear: the incoming branch wants to extend the options object with an additional configuration option while preserving all existing properties.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
        },
        options = {
            currentLocale: defaults.currentLocale,
            zeroFormat: defaults.zeroFormat,
            nullFormat: defaults.nullFormat,
            defaultFormat: defaults.defaultFormat,
            scalePercentBy100: defaults.scalePercentBy100
        };
