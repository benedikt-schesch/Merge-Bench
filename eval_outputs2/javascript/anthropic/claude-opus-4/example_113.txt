Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add the same line `backendRetries: (r) => r >= 0` to what appears to be a validations object. The only difference is that HEAD doesn't have a trailing comma while the other branch does have one.

Since both sides want the same validation rule, and JavaScript allows trailing commas in object literals (which is generally considered good practice for cleaner diffs), I'll resolve this by keeping the line with the trailing comma:

```javascript
    port: checkValidPort,
    callbackPort: checkValidPort,
    bootstrapPort: checkValidPort,
    chromedriverPort: checkValidPort,
    robotPort: checkValidPort,
    backendRetries: (r) => r >= 0,
  };

  const nonDefaultArgs = getNonDefaultArgs(parser, args);

  for (let [arg, validator] of _.toPairs(validations)) {

```
