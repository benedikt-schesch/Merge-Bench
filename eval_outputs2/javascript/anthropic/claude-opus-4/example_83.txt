Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the version number in the header comment of a JavaScript distribution file. The conflict is between:

- HEAD: Version 5.0.10-beta.10
- Incoming change: Version 5.0.10-beta.14

Since this appears to be a version number conflict where both sides are incrementing the beta version, and beta.14 is a higher version than beta.10, the semantic intent is to use the most recent version number.

    if ("object" == typeof exports && "object" == typeof module) module.exports = t(); else if ("function" == typeof define && define.amd) define([], t); else {
        var n = t();
        for (var i in n) ("object" == typeof exports ? exports : e)[i] = n[i];
