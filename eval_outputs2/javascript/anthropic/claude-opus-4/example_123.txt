Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import error-related modules and cancellation modules, but with different names and structures. The conflict appears to be part of a refactoring where the error handling and cancellation system was updated.

Based on the semantic intent of both sides:
- HEAD side uses: `createError`, `enhanceError`, `transitionalDefaults`, and `Cancel`
- The other side uses: `defaults`, `AxiosError`, and `CanceledError`

This appears to be a refactoring where:
- `createError` and `enhanceError` were consolidated into `AxiosError`
- `Cancel` was renamed to `CanceledError`
- `transitionalDefaults` was merged into `defaults`

The semantic resolution should include the newer refactored imports from the second side, as they represent the evolved codebase structure.

```javascript
var httpFollow = require('follow-redirects').http;
var httpsFollow = require('follow-redirects').https;
var url = require('url');
var zlib = require('zlib');
var VERSION = require('./../env/data').version;
var defaults = require('../defaults');
var AxiosError = require('../core/AxiosError');
var CanceledError = require('../cancel/CanceledError');

var isHttps = /https:?/;
