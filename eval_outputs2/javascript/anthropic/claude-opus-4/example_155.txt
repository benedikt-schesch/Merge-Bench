Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

**HEAD (left side):**
- Has a conditional check for various marker properties (className, title, startStyle, endStyle)
- If any of these properties exist, it calls `regLineChange` for each line in the range
- Calls `reCheckSelection` with `cm.doc` as the argument

**Right side (8d87f56...):**
- Removes the conditional check and the loop entirely
- Calls `reCheckSelection` with just `cm` as the argument (different from HEAD)

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. HEAD wants to register line changes when certain style properties are present
2. The right side seems to have removed this functionality, possibly as a refactoring or optimization
3. There's also a difference in how `reCheckSelection` is called - with `cm.doc` vs just `cm`

Since the right side appears to be a more recent change that deliberately removed the conditional logic, and changed the `reCheckSelection` call signature, I'll preserve the right side's changes as they seem intentional:

```javascript
    if (cm) {
      // Sync editor state
      if (updateMaxLine) cm.curOp.updateMaxLine = true;
      if (marker.collapsed)
        regChange(cm, from.line, to.line + 1);
      if (marker.atomic) reCheckSelection(cm);
      signalLater(cm, "markerAdded", cm, marker);
    }
    return marker;
  }
