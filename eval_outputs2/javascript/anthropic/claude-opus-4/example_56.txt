Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same semantic intent - saving a settings value when a text input changes. The differences are:

1. The method name: `Settings.set` vs `set_settings`
2. The console.log: commented out vs active

Since both sides are functionally trying to do the same thing (save settings), but HEAD has the console.log commented out (suggesting it was used for debugging and then disabled), I'll preserve the HEAD's approach of having the console.log commented out, but I cannot definitively choose between the two method names without more context about the codebase's conventions.

Here's the original snippet with the conflict preserved:

```javascript
        for (const $text of $texts) {
            $text.value = v;
            // Listen
            $text.addEventListener('input', async () => {
                const value = $text.value;
<<<<<<< HEAD
                await BG.exec('Settings.set', {id: k, value: value});
                // console.log(k, value);
=======
                await BG.exec('set_settings', {id: k, value: value});
                console.log(k, value);
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
            });
        }
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
