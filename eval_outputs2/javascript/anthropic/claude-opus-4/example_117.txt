Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- **HEAD (current branch)**: Declares 4 variables: `webglFi, svmFi, mosseCalc, jf`
- **Incoming branch**: Declares 3 variables: `webglFi, svmFi, mosseCalc`

The conflict is about whether to include the `jf` variable or not. Since the HEAD branch has added `jf` as a new variable declaration while the incoming branch doesn't have it, this appears to be an intentional addition in the current branch.

Following the principle of preserving intentional changes from both sides, and since adding a variable declaration doesn't conflict with the incoming changes semantically, the resolution should keep the `jf` variable from HEAD.

```javascript
		}
		var pw, pl, pdataLength;

		var facecheck_count = 0;

		var webglFi, svmFi, mosseCalc, jf;

		var scoringCanvas = document.createElement('canvas');
		//document.body.appendChild(scoringCanvas);
		var scoringContext = scoringCanvas.getContext('2d');
		var msxmin, msymin, msxmax, msymax;

```
