Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to call a method to retrieve settings, but they're using different method names:

- **HEAD**: Uses `'Settings.get'`
- **Incoming change**: Uses `'get_settings'`

Since I cannot determine from the context alone which is the correct API method name for the `BG.exec` call, I'll return the snippet with the conflict unchanged:

```javascript
                if (checking) {
                    return;
                }
                checking = true;

<<<<<<< HEAD
                const settings = await BG.exec('Settings.get');
=======
                const settings = await BG.exec('get_settings');
>>>>>>> a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24
                if (!settings.enabled || !settings.funcaptcha_auto_solve) {
                    return;
                }

                if (settings.funcaptcha_auto_open && is_widget_frame()) {

```
