Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the same test assertion, but with slightly different syntax:

- HEAD version uses `Array [` syntax
- The other branch uses `[` syntax and adds a type annotation `(console.error: any)`

The semantic intent is the same - both are testing that `console.error` was called with a specific error message about illegal escape sequences. The conflict is purely syntactic.

The more modern approach would be to use the simpler array syntax without the `Array` keyword, and the type annotation `(console.error: any)` appears to be addressing a Flow/TypeScript type checking issue.

Here's the resolved version:

```javascript
    :before {
      content: '\00d7';
    }
  `

  expect((console.error: any).mock.calls[0]).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    [
      "You have illegal escape sequence in your template literal, most likely inside content's property value.
    Because you write your CSS inside a JavaScript string you actually have to do double escaping, so for example "content: '\\00d7';" should become "content: '\\\\00d7';".
