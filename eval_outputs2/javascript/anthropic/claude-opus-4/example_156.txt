Looking at this merge conflict, both sides appear to be trying to achieve the same thing - they both want a blank line after the `req[4] = inode.gid; // group id` line. The only difference is in the whitespace characters used:

- HEAD has a line with some spaces/tabs
- The incoming change (8107f26f) has a completely empty line

Since both sides want a blank line here and the semantic intent is identical, I'll resolve this by keeping the cleaner version with no whitespace characters:

```javascript
            req[1] = inode.qid;

            req[2] = inode.mode;
            req[3] = inode.uid; // user id
            req[4] = inode.gid; // group id

            req[5] = inode.nlinks; // number of hard links
            req[6] = (inode.major<<8) | (inode.minor); // device id low
            req[7] = inode.size; // size low
            req[8] = this.BLOCKSIZE;
            req[9] = Math.floor(inode.size/512+1); // blk size low

```
