Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch does not have the `leadingCount = 0,` line, while the incoming branch adds it. Based on the context of this being a number formatting function, the `leadingCount` variable appears to be a new feature or fix being introduced to track leading digits or zeros in number formatting.

Since this appears to be an additive change that doesn't conflict with the existing code logic, I'll resolve this by accepting the incoming change and including the `leadingCount` variable declaration.

```javascript
        // formats numbers separators, decimals places, signs, abbreviations
        numberToFormat: function(value, format, roundingFunction) {
            var locale = locales[numeral.options.currentLocale],
                negP = false,
                optDec = false,
                leadingCount = 0,
                abbr = '',
                trillion = 1000000000000,
                billion = 1000000000,
                million = 1000000,
                thousand = 1000,

```
