Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to configure the `hda` (hard disk) property for a "windows95-boot" configuration, but they're pointing to different disk images:

- HEAD is using `freebsd3.img` with a size of ~17GB
- The other branch is using `w95.img` with a size of ~242MB

Given that this configuration has `id: "windows95-boot"` and `name: "Windows 95"`, the semantic intent is clearly to boot Windows 95. The `w95.img` file is the appropriate choice here, as it matches the intended operating system. The FreeBSD image appears to be incorrect for this configuration.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
            },
            {
                id: "windows95-boot",
                memory_size: 32 * 1024 * 1024,
                hda: {
                    "url": HOST + "w95.img",
                    "size": 242049024,
                    "async": true,
                    use_parts: !ON_LOCALHOST,
                },
                name: "Windows 95",
            },
```
