Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

**HEAD (current branch):**
- Uses `'Function': '[]["at"]'`
- Includes `'Object': '[]["entries"]()'`
- Has 3 entries after 'Boolean'

**Incoming changes:**
- Uses `'Function': '[]["flat"]'`
- Does not include the 'Object' entry
- Has 2 entries after 'Boolean'

Both sides are defining JavaScript constructors using obfuscated code. The conflict is about:
1. Which array method to use for the Function constructor (`at` vs `flat`)
2. Whether to include the Object constructor

Since I cannot determine the intent without more context (both `at` and `flat` are valid array methods that could return functions, and the inclusion of Object constructor could be intentional or not), I'll return the snippet with the conflict markers intact:

```javascript
  const CONSTRUCTORS = {
    'Array':    '[]',
    'Number':   '(+[])',
    'String':   '([]+[])',
    'Boolean':  '(![])',
<<<<<<< HEAD
    'Function': '[]["at"]',
    'RegExp':   'Function("return/"+false+"/")()',
    'Object':	'[]["entries"]()'
=======
    'Function': '[]["flat"]',
    'RegExp':   'Function("return/"+false+"/")()'
>>>>>>> e5c027487a2338bc4452da079781652ffa4573b9
  };

  const MAPPING = {
    'a':   '(false+"")[1]',
    'b':   '([]["entries"]()+"")[2]',

```
