Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the `STATE_VERSION` constant - one side (HEAD) sets it to 5, while the other side sets it to 6. Since version numbers typically increment sequentially and the incoming branch has a higher version number (6), it likely represents the more recent change that should be kept.

```javascript
"use strict";

/** @const */
var STATE_VERSION = 6;

/** @const */
var STATE_MAGIC = 0x86768676|0;

/** @const */

```
