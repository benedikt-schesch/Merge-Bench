Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch has an empty line between the closing brace and the comment, while the incoming branch (a9ce98f97aaed5e50c711de3913c3138d4188b24) has no empty line.

This appears to be a simple whitespace/formatting conflict. Since both sides have the same functional code and the only difference is the presence or absence of a blank line, I'll preserve the version with the blank line as it provides better visual separation between the function blocks, which is a common coding style practice.

```javascript
            const $tab = document.querySelector(`[data-tab="${$e.dataset.tabtarget}"]`);
            $tab.classList.remove('hidden');
        });
    }


    /**
     * Navigate backwards on mouse back or backspace
     */

    function back() {

```
