Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to add different utility imports to the same import statement. The HEAD branch wants to add `useGetterPropsCalledChecker` while the other branch wants to add `useLatestRef`. 

Since both imports appear to be different utilities that serve different purposes (one for checking getter props calls and another for maintaining latest refs), and there's no semantic conflict between them, the resolution should include both imports.

```javascript
  isAcceptedCharacterKey,
  useControlledReducer,
  getInitialState,
  updateA11yStatus,
  useMouseAndTouchTracker,
  useGetterPropsCalledChecker,
  useLatestRef,
} from '../utils'
import {
  callAllEventHandlers,
  handleRefs,
  debounce,
```
