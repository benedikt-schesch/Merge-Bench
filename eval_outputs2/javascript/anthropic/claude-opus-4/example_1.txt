Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import error-related classes from '../control.js', but with different selections:

- HEAD wants: `HttpError` and `Redirect`
- The other branch wants: `Redirect` and `NotFound`

Both sides agree on needing `Redirect`, but differ on the error class. Based on common patterns in web frameworks, `NotFound` is typically a specific type of `HttpError` (usually representing a 404 error). The HEAD branch appears to be importing the more general `HttpError` class, while the other branch is importing the more specific `NotFound` class.

Without more context about how these imports are used in the rest of the file, I cannot definitively determine which combination is correct. The semantic intent is ambiguous - it could be that:
1. The code needs both the general `HttpError` and the specific `NotFound`
2. The code was refactored to use only `NotFound` instead of `HttpError`
3. The code was refactored to use only `HttpError` instead of `NotFound`

Therefore, I'm returning the snippet with the conflict markers intact:

```javascript
} from '../../utils/url.js';
import { exec } from '../../utils/routing.js';
import { redirect_json_response, render_data } from './data/index.js';
import { add_cookies_to_headers, get_cookies } from './cookie.js';
import { create_fetch } from './fetch.js';
