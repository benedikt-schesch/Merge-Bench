Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to update the version date:
- HEAD has: `version: February 2021`
- The incoming change has: `version: 20 February 2021`

The intent appears to be the same - both want to mark this as the February 2021 version. The incoming change is more specific with the exact date (20 February 2021), which provides more precise versioning information.

Since both changes have the same intent but the incoming change provides more detail, I'll resolve this by keeping the more specific version:
