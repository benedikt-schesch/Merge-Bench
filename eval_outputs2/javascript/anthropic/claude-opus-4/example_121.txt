Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what each side is trying to achieve:

- HEAD (current branch): Declares 4 variables: `webglFi, svmFi, mosseCalc, jf`
- Incoming branch: Declares 3 variables: `webglFi, svmFi, mosseCalc`

The semantic difference is that HEAD adds an additional variable `jf` to the declaration. Since both sides agree on the first three variables and HEAD is adding one more, the intent seems to be to include all four variables in the final version.

```javascript
			var vecpos = new Array(2);
		}
		var pw, pl, pdataLength;

		var facecheck_count = 0;
		
		var webglFi, svmFi, mosseCalc, jf;

		var scoringCanvas = document.createElement('canvas');
		//document.body.appendChild(scoringCanvas);
		var scoringContext = scoringCanvas.getContext('2d');
		var msxmin, msymin, msxmax, msymax;

```
