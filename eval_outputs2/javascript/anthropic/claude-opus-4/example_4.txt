Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that the HEAD branch is missing version 1.33 changelog entries that exist in the incoming branch. Since this appears to be a changelog/version history section, both sides should be preserved to maintain a complete record.

```javascript
 * v1.29: Support responsive sizing, by @drewnoakes
 * v1.29.1: Include types in package, and make property optional, by @TrentHouliston
 * v1.30: Fix inverted logic in devicePixelRatio support, by @scanlime
 * v1.31: Support tooltips, by @Sly1024 and @drewnoakes
 * v1.32: Support frame rate limit, by @dpuyosa
 * v1.33: Use Date static method instead of instance, by @nnnoel
 *        Fix bug with tooltips when multiple charts on a page, by @jpmbiz70
