Looking at this merge conflict, both sides are trying to achieve the same thing - creating an LRU cache for micro-caching with identical configuration. The only difference is the variable name:
- HEAD uses `pageCache`
- The incoming change uses `microCache`

Both names are reasonable and convey the same intent. Since the comment refers to "micro-cache" and "microcache", I'll resolve this by using `microCache` to maintain consistency with the terminology in the comments.

```javascript
app.use('/dist', serve('./dist', true))
app.use('/public', serve('./public', true))
app.use('/manifest.json', serve('./manifest.json', true))
app.use('/service-worker.js', serve('./dist/service-worker.js'))

// 1-second microcache.
// https://www.nginx.com/blog/benefits-of-microcaching-nginx/
const microCache = LRU({
  max: 100,
  maxAge: 1000
})

// since this app has no user-specific content, every page is micro-cacheable.

```
