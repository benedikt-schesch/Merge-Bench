Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to define the same `random` function, just with different syntax:

- HEAD uses the ES6 `export function` syntax
- The incoming change uses an arrow function with `let`

Since both implementations have the same function body and semantics (generating random bytes), and the HEAD version includes an export which suggests this function is meant to be used externally, I'll resolve this by keeping the HEAD version with the export:

```javascript
    poolOffset = 0
  }
  poolOffset += bytes
}

export function random(bytes) {
  // `|=` convert `bytes` to number to prevent `valueOf` abusing and pool pollution
  fillPool((bytes |= 0))
  return pool.subarray(poolOffset - bytes, poolOffset)
}


```
