Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same result - they both want to include the code that adds the 'off' class to the power button and the subscription key section with its associated comment and constant declaration.

The only difference is that the HEAD version has an extra blank line before the comment section, while the other branch does not. Since this is purely a formatting difference and both sides have the same semantic intent, I'll resolve by keeping the code without the extra blank line for consistency:

```javascript
            $power_btn.classList.add('off');
        }
    });

    /**
     * Subscription key
     */

    const $key = document.querySelector('.settings_text[data-settings="key"]');
```
