Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to achieve the same functionality - they're both requiring the same modules and setting up the same variables. The only difference is:

- HEAD uses `'use strict'` and `const` declarations (ES6 style)
- The other branch uses `var` declarations (ES5 style)

Since the HEAD version is using more modern JavaScript practices (`'use strict'` and `const`), and both achieve the same semantic intent, I'll resolve in favor of the HEAD version:

```javascript
'use strict'
const path = require('path')
const utils = require('./utils')
const config = require('../config')
const vueLoaderConfig = require('./vue-loader.conf')

function resolve (dir) {
  return path.join(__dirname, '..', dir)
}
