Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the error handling logic, but with different approaches:

**HEAD (current branch):**
- Uses string literal `'ERR_FR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS'` for the error code comparison
- Uses `enhanceError()` function to process the error

**Incoming changes:**
- Uses `AxiosError.ERR_FR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` (likely a constant)
- Uses `AxiosError.from()` method to create the error
- Changes the logic to `return` instead of `reject(err)` when the condition is met

The semantic intent appears to be:
1. Both sides want to handle the case where the request is aborted
2. Both sides want to treat the "too many redirects" error differently
3. The incoming changes appear to be part of a refactoring to use a more structured `AxiosError` class

Since the incoming changes represent a more comprehensive refactoring (using error constants and a dedicated error class), and they also fix the logic by returning early instead of rejecting twice, the incoming changes should be preferred:

```javascript
      }
    });

    // Handle errors
    req.on('error', function handleRequestError(err) {
      if (req.aborted && err.code !== AxiosError.ERR_FR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS) return;
      reject(AxiosError.from(err, null, config, req));
    });

    // set tcp keep alive to prevent drop connection by peer
    req.on('socket', function handleRequestSocket(socket) {
      // default interval of sending ack packet is 1 minute

```
