Looking at this merge conflict, I need to understand what both sides are trying to achieve:

- **HEAD**: Uses `\${0%/*}/h` - This is a parameter expansion that removes everything after the last `/` from `$0` (the script path)
- **Branch eb54845768e9d38cd81a98204511de665e8dda6b**: Uses `\$(dirname "\$0")/h` - This uses the `dirname` command to get the directory of the script

Both approaches are trying to achieve the same semantic goal: get the directory containing the current script and then source the `h` file from that directory. The key differences are:
- `${0%/*}` is a pure shell parameter expansion (faster, no subprocess)
- `$(dirname "$0")` spawns a subprocess but is more portable and handles edge cases better

Given that this appears to be a git hook script (based on the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env sh` and the `.gitignore` context), and considering the branch change seems to be moving toward better compatibility, I'll resolve in favor of the more portable `dirname` approach:

```javascript
	})

	f.mkdirSync(_(), { recursive: true })
	w(_('.gitignore'), '*')
	f.copyFileSync(new URL('husky', import.meta.url), _('h'))
	l.forEach(h => w(_(h), `#!/usr/bin/env sh\n. "\$(dirname "\$0")/h"`, { mode: 0o755 }))
	return ''
}
```
