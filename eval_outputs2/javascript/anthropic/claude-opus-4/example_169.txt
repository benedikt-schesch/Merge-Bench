Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to import testing utilities, but from different locations:

- HEAD is importing `moduleId` utilities from a local source path
- The incoming change is importing `resetSheets` and `resetModuleId` from a tests utilities path

Based on the semantics, it appears both sides want testing utilities for resetting state. The incoming change seems more comprehensive as it includes both `resetSheets` and `resetModuleId` functions from a dedicated test utilities location, while HEAD only imports the moduleId module.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
/* eslint-disable no-underscore-dangle */

import expect from 'expect.js'
import {createGenerateId} from '../../src'
import {resetSheets, resetModuleId} from '../../../../tests/utils'

const sheetMock = {
  options: {
    classNamePrefix: 'p',
    jss: {id: 0}

```
