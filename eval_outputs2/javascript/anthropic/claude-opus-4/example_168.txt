Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to close the same code block (likely a function or object), but with slightly different syntax:

- HEAD version uses `}` (without semicolon)
- The other branch uses `};` (with semicolon)

Since this appears to be closing an object literal or a prototype method definition (given the context showing `FS.prototype.FillDirectory`), the semantically correct choice would be to use `};` with the semicolon, as this is the proper syntax for closing object literals and prototype assignments in JavaScript.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
};

FS.prototype.FillDirectory = function(dirid) {
    const inode = this.inodes[dirid];
    if(this.is_forwarder(inode))
    {
```
