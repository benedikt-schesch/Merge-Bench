Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the webpack assets manifest. The only difference between the two versions is the hash for the `index.js` entry:

- HEAD has: `index@8202947f0c05ff5e96d8.js` and `index@8202947f0c05ff5e96d8.css`
- The incoming change has: `index@e45a4de49431db58f52c.js` and `index@e45a4de49431db58f52c.css`

All other assets (`lib`, `lib2`, `lib3`, and `manifest`) have identical hashes in both versions.

Since webpack generates these hashes based on the content of the files, and this appears to be an auto-generated manifest file, the different hashes indicate that the `index.js` file has different content between the two branches. Without knowing which version of the index file is the correct one to keep, I cannot deterministically resolve this conflict.

This type of conflict typically requires knowing which branch has the intended changes to the index file, or potentially rebuilding the assets after merging the source files.
