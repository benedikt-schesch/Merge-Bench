Looking at this merge conflict, I can see that both sides are trying to update the date in the header comment of the Magnific Popup library. The HEAD version has the date "2015-05-18" while the incoming change has "2015-09-17".

Since this appears to be a version/release date update, and the incoming change (2015-09-17) is more recent than the HEAD version (2015-05-18), the semantically correct resolution would be to keep the more recent date.

Here's the resolved code:

```javascript
/*! Magnific Popup - v1.0.0 - 2015-09-17
* http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/
* Copyright (c) 2015 Dmitry Semenov; */
;(function (factory) { 
if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) { 
 // AMD. Register as an anonymous module. 

```
