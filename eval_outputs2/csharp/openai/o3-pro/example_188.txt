```java
                return null;
            }

            // Perf: In most of the common cases, GenerateUrl is called with a null protocol, host and fragment.
            // In such cases, we might not need to build any URL as the url generated is mostly same as the virtual path available in pathData.
            // For such common cases, this FastGenerateUrl method saves a string allocation per GenerateUrl call.
            if (TryFastGenerateUrl(protocol, host, virtualPath, fragment, out var url))
