```java

                    // Only a few tests use this codepath, so it's fine to use the less reliable GetNextPort() for simplicity.
                    // The tests using this codepath will be reviewed to see if they can be changed to directly bind to dynamic
                    // port "0" on "127.0.0.1" and scrape the assigned port from the status message (the default codepath).
